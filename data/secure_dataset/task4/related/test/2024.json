A problem in the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification of async generators, introduced by a May 2021 spec refactor, may lead to mis-implementation in a way that could present as a security vulnerability, such as type confusion and pointer dereference.\n\nThe internal async generator machinery calls regular promise resolver functions on IteratorResult (`{ done, value }`) objects that it creates, assuming that the IteratorResult objects will not be then-ables. Unfortunately, these IteratorResult objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, so these IteratorResult objects can be made then-able, triggering arbitrary behaviour, including re-entering the async generator machinery in a way that violates some internal invariants.\n\nThe ECMAScript specification is a living standard and the issue has been addressed at the time of this advisory's public disclosure. JavaScript engine implementors should refer to the latest specification and update their implementations to comply with the `AsyncGenerator` section.\n\n## References\n\n- https:\/\/github.com\/tc39\/ecma262\/commit\/1e24a286d0a327d08e1154926b3ee79820232727\n- https:\/\/bugzilla.mozilla.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=1901411\n- https:\/\/github.com\/boa-dev\/boa\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-f67q-wr6w-23jq\n- https:\/\/bugs.webkit.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=275407\n- https:\/\/issues.chromium.org\/issues\/346692561\n- https:\/\/www.cve.org\/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7652 <reference description>:Access DeniedCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: 8.6","output":"CVE-2024-7652, CVE-2024-43357"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads. <reference description>:RHSA-2024:2041 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: 7.3","output":"CVE-2024-31081, CVE-2024-31080, CVE-2024-31083"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

An attacker could craft a special URL to point to a malicious website and send the link to a victim. The fact that the link would contain a trusted domain (e.g. from one of public Whoogle instances) could be used to trick the user into clicking the link.

Starting in version 0.16 and prior to version 0.19.0, a wrong assumption made when handling ECMAScript's `AsyncGenerator` operations can cause an uncaught exception on certain scripts. Boa's implementation of `AsyncGenerator` makes the assumption that the state of an `AsyncGenerator` object cannot change while resolving a promise created by methods of `AsyncGenerator` such as `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.next`, `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.return`, or `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.throw`. However, a carefully constructed code could trigger a state transition from a getter method for the promise's `then` property, which causes the engine to fail an assertion of this assumption, causing an uncaught exception. This could be used to create a Denial Of Service attack in applications that run arbitrary ECMAScript code provided by an external user. Version 0.19.0 is patched to correctly handle this case. Users unable to upgrade to the patched version would want to use `std::panic::catch_unwind` to ensure any exceptions caused by the engine don't impact the availability of the main application. <reference description>:Uncaught exception when transitioning the state of `AsyncGenerator` objects from within a property getter of `then` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 boa-dev\/boa \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: 7.5","output":"CVE-2024-43367, CVE-2024-43357"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

The latest version of @intlify\/shared (10.0.4) is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the entry function(s) lib.deepCopy. An attacker can supply a payload with Object.prototype setter to introduce or modify properties within the global prototype chain, causing denial of service (DoS) as the minimum consequence. Moreover, the consequences of this vulnerability can escalate to other injection-based attacks, depending on how the library integrates within the application. For instance, if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), it could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the application's context. This issue has been addressed in versions 9.14.2, and 10.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade.

This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads. <reference description>:RHSA-2024:2042 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: 7.3","output":"CVE-2024-31081, CVE-2024-31080, CVE-2024-31083"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads. <reference description>:RHSA-2024:2080 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: 7.3","output":"CVE-2024-31081, CVE-2024-31080, CVE-2024-31083"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

Untrusted Wasm programs that are given access to any filesystem directory could bypass the sandbox and access devices through those special device filenames with superscript digits, and through them gain access peripheral devices connected to the computer, or network resources mapped to those devices. This can include modems, printers, network printers, and any other device connected to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB serial ports.

Prior to version 2.2.4, a remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial. The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial. This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer.

Continued BGP session flapping will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue only affects routers configured with non-stop routing (NSR) enabled. Graceful Restart (GR) helper mode, enabled by default, is also required for this issue to be exploitable.\n\n\nNote: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.\nWhen the BGP session flaps on the NSR-enabled router, the device enters GR-helper\/LLGR-helper mode due to the peer having negotiated GR\/LLGR-restarter capability and the backup BGP requests for replication of the GR\/LLGR-helper session, master BGP schedules, and initiates replication of GR\/LLGR stale routes to the backup BGP. In this state, if the BGP session with the BGP peer comes up again, unsolicited replication is initiated for the peer without cleaning up the ongoing GR\/LLGR-helper mode replication. This parallel two instances of replication for the same peer leads to the assert if the BGP session flaps again.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n\n\n\n  *  All versions earlier

This netif_rx()\nimplementation is guarded by local_bh_disable() and local_bh_enable().\nThe local_bh_enable() may call do_softirq() to run softirqs in case\nany are pending. One of the softirqs is net_rx_action, which ultimately\nreaches the driver .start_xmit callback. If that happens, the system\nhangs. The entire call chain is below:\n\nks8851_start_xmit_par from netdev_start_xmit\nnetdev_start_xmit from dev_hard_start_xmit\ndev_hard_start_xmit from sch_direct_xmit\nsch_direct_xmit from __dev_queue_xmit\n__dev_queue_xmit from __neigh_update\n__neigh_update from neigh_update\nneigh_update from arp_process.constprop.0\narp_process.constprop.0 from __netif_receive_skb_one_core\n__netif_receive_skb_one_core from process_backlog\nprocess_backlog from __napi_poll.constprop.0\n__napi_poll.constprop.0 from net_rx_action\nnet_rx_action from __do_softirq\n__do_softirq from call_with_stack\ncall_with_stack from do_softirq\ndo_softirq from __local_bh_enable_ip\n__local_bh_enable_ip from netif_rx\nnetif_rx from ks8851_irq\nks8851_irq from irq_thread_fn\nirq_thread_fn from irq_thread\nirq_thread from kthread\nkthread from ret_from_fork\n\nThe hang happens because ks8851_irq() first locks a spinlock in\nks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spin_lock_irqsave(&ksp->lock, ...)\nand with that spinlock locked, calls netif_rx(). Once the execution\nreaches ks8851_start_xmit_par(), it calls ks8851_lock_par() again\nwhich attempts to claim the already locked spinlock again, and the\nhang happens.\n\nMove the do_softirq() call outside of the spinlock protected section\nof ks8851_irq() by disabling BHs around the entire spinlock protected\nsection of ks8851_irq() handler. Place local_bh_enable() outside of\nthe spinlock protected section, so that it can trigger do_softirq()\nwithout the ks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spinlock being held, and\nsafely call ks8851_start_xmit_par() without attempting to lock the\nalready locked spinlock.\n\nSince ks8851_irq() is protected by local_bh_disable()\/local_bh_enable()\nnow, replace netif_rx() with __netif_rx() which is not duplicating the\nlocal_bh_disable()\/local_bh_enable() calls. <reference description>:oss-security - Re: List linux CVEs for a given stable release?CVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: N\/A","output":"CVE-2024-36013, CVE-2024-35951, CVE-2024-35844, CVE-2024-35867, CVE-2024-26629, CVE-2024-35904, CVE-2024-36009, CVE-2024-35971"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

Prior to version 2.2.4, a remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial. The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial. This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability. <reference description>:Fixes for GHSA-88jx-383q-w4qc and GHSA-95pr-fxf5-86gv (#3661) \u00b7 sigstore\/cosign@629f5f8 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: 4.2","output":"CVE-2024-29903, CVE-2024-29902"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. The webpack developers have discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack\u2019s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present. Real-world exploitation of this gadget has been observed in the Canvas LMS which allows a XSS attack to happen through a javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes. This issue has been addressed in release version 5.94.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. <reference description>:XSS in GMail's AMP4Email via DOM Clobbering - research.securitum.comExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:\nWebpack.js\u00bbWebpack\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.94.0cpe:2.3:a:webpack.js:webpack:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nWebpack\u00bbWebpackVersions  before (<) 5.94.0cpe:2.3:a:webpack:webpack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions <CVSS Scores>: 6.1","output":"CVE-2024-43788, CVE-2024-45812"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

With having more then 2^32 blocks\nresize_inode is turned off by default by mke2fs. The issue can be\nreproduced on a smaller file system for convenience by explicitly\nturning off resize_inode. An on-line resize across an 8 GiB boundary (the\nsize of a meta block group in this setup) then leads to a corruption:\n\n  dev=\/dev\/<some_dev> # should be >= 16 GiB\n  mkdir -p \/corruption\n  \/sbin\/mke2fs -t ext4 -b 4096 -O ^resize_inode $dev $((2 * 2**21 - 2**15))\n  mount -t ext4 $dev \/corruption\n\n  dd if=\/dev\/zero bs=4096 of=\/corruption\/test count=$((2*2**21 - 4*2**15))\n  sha1sum \/corruption\/test\n  # 79d2658b39dcfd77274e435b0934028adafaab11  \/corruption\/test\n\n  \/sbin\/resize2fs $dev $((2*2**21))\n  # drop page cache to force reload the block from disk\n  echo 1 > \/proc\/sys\/vm\/drop_caches\n\n  sha1sum \/corruption\/test\n  # 3c2abc63cbf1a94c9e6977e0fbd72cd832c4d5c3  \/corruption\/test\n\n2^21 = 2^15*2^6 equals 8 GiB whereof 2^15 is the number of blocks per\nblock group and 2^6 are the number of block groups that make a meta\nblock group.\n\nThe last checksum might be different depending on how the file is laid\nout across the physical blocks. The actual corruption occurs at physical\nblock 63*2^15 = 2064384 which would be the location of the backup of the\nmeta block group's block descriptor. During the on-line resize the file\nsystem will be converted to meta_bg starting at s_first_meta_bg which is\n2 in the example - meaning all block groups after 16 GiB. However, in\next4_flex_group_add we might add block groups that are not part of the\nfirst meta block group yet. In the reproducer we achieved this by\nsubstracting the size of a whole block group from the point where the\nmeta block group would start. This must be considered when updating the\nbackup block group descriptors to follow the non-meta_bg layout. The fix\nis to add a test whether the group to add is already part of the meta\nblock group or not. <reference description>:[SECURITY] [DLA 3842-1] linux-5.10 security updateCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: N\/A","output":"CVE-2022-38096, CVE-2023-52497, CVE-2023-47233, CVE-2023-52447, CVE-2023-52583, CVE-2023-6270, CVE-2023-52489, CVE-2023-52486, CVE-2023-52498, CVE-2023-7042, CVE-2023-52429, CVE-2023-52491, CVE-2023-52493, CVE-2023-52488, CVE-2023-52434, CVE-2023-28746, CVE-2023-52435, CVE-2023-52458, CVE-2023-52492, CVE-2023-52482"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

Affected versions of vite were discovered to contain a DOM Clobbering vulnerability when building scripts to `cjs`\/`iife`\/`umd` output format. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an img tag with an unsanitized name attribute) are present. DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. We have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts dynamically import other scripts from the assets folder and the developer sets the build output format to `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`. In such cases, Vite replaces relative paths starting with `__VITE_ASSET__` using the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`. However, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the src attribute of the attacker-controlled element is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server. This vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include Vite-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the name or id attributes. This issue has been patched in versions 5.4.6, 5.3.6, 5.2.14, 4.5.5, and 3.2.11. Users are advised to upgrade.

It was these new tests that helped us uncover these issues. As of now the project exercises every possible attack vector the developers can think of \u2014 including enumerating every ASCII character, and we run these tests in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Additionally, we test against a list of 6613 known XSS payloads (see: payloadbox\/xss-payload-list). The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were working as designed. However, their design didn't take into account just how recklessly permissive browsers are when it comes to executing unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all minor versions released in the last year. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should configure a Content Security Policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline` which would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Users who upgrade are also advised to configure a Content Security Policy header that does not allow `unsafe-inline`. <reference description>:Content-Security-Policy - HTTP | MDNCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: 7.1","output":"CVE-2024-28199, CVE-2024-32463, CVE-2024-32970"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.

This can result in migration\nbeing resumed from an entry that does not belong to the chunk being\nmigrated. In turn, this will eventually lead to a chunk being iterated\nover as if it is an entry. Because of how the two structures happen to\nbe defined, this does not lead to KASAN splats, but to warnings such as\n[1].\n\nFix by creating a helper that resets all the markers and call it from\nall the places the currently only reset the chunk marker.

Similarly to the GHSL-2023-250 issue, `AlertUtil::validateExpression` is also called from `EventSubscriptionRepository.prepare()`, which can lead to Remote Code Execution. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which, in turn, gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that, even though there is an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`), it gets called after `prepareInternal()` gets called and, therefore, after the SpEL expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method, an attacker can send a PUT request to `\/api\/v1\/events\/subscriptions` which gets handled by `EventSubscriptionResource.createOrUpdateEventSubscription()`. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue. <reference description>:Merge pull request from GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj \u00b7 vyperlang\/vyper@3de1415 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url <Affected Products>:N\/A <CVSS Scores>: 5.3","output":"CVE-2024-32481, CVE-2023-32058"},{"instruction":"The following is a CVE case: <description> a description of the vulnerability, outlining its impact and type of issue. <reference description> a brief summary of the linked content, helping to quickly understand its relevance and purpose regarding the vulnerability. <affected products> the affected products and their versions. <CVSS Scores> the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score used to quantify the severity of the vulnerability.
