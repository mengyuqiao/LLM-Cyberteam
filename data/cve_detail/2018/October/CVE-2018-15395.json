{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15395", "Description": "A vulnerability in the authentication and authorization checking mechanisms of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to gain network access to a Cisco TrustSec domain. Under normal circumstances, this access should be prohibited. The vulnerability is due to the dynamic assignment of Security Group Tags (SGTs) during a wireless roam from one Service Set Identifier (SSID) to another within the Cisco TrustSec domain. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to acquire an SGT from other SSIDs within the domain. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain privileged network access that should be prohibited under normal circumstances.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15395", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller Software\u00bbVersion:8.5(120.0)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:8.5\\(120.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-10-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105676", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller CVE-2018-15395 Remote Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlan-escalation", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041925", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Cisco TrustSec Domain Lets Remote Authenticated Users Gain Elevated Privileges - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
