{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15404", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on the size or total amount of resources allowed via the web interface. An attacker who has valid credentials for the application could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted or malformed HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause oversubscription of system resources or cause a component to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15404", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIntegrated Management Controller Supervisor\u00bbVersion:2.1(0.0)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:integrated_management_controller_supervisor:2.1\\(0.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Computing System Director\u00bbVersion:6.6(0.0)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_computing_system_director:6.6\\(0.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-12  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-imcs-ucsd-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Integrated Management Controller Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director System Resources Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
