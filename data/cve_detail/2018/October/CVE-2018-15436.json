{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15436", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Webex Events Center, Cisco Webex Meeting Center, Cisco Webex Support Center, and Cisco Webex Training Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of the affected service. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15436", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings Online\u00bbVersion:T33.4.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings_online:t33.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Business Suite 32Versions  from including (>=) 32.17.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_business_suite_32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Business Suite 33Versions  from including (>=) 33.4.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_business_suite_33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Business Suite 31Versions  from including (>=) 31.29.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_business_suite_31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-07-18  0.16%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-05-22  0.21%  0.16%  -0.05 \n 4  2024-02-24  0.22%  0.21%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-09-29  0.25%  0.22%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.21%  0.23%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041793", "ref_desc": "Cisco WebEx Meeting Center Input Validation Flaw Lets Remote Users Conduct Cross-Site Scripting Attacks - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105557", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Centers CVE-2018-15436 Cross Site Scripting VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041794", "ref_desc": "Cisco WebEx Event Center Input Validation Flaw Lets Remote Users Conduct Cross-Site Scripting Attacks - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-webex-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Centers Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
