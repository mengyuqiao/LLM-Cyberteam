{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18830", "Description": "An issue was discovered in com\\mingsoft\\basic\\action\\web\\FileAction.java in MCMS 4.6.5. Since the upload interface does not verify the user login status, you can use this interface to upload files without setting a cookie. First, start an upload of JSP code with a .png filename, and then intercept the data packet. In the name parameter, change the suffix to jsp. In the response, the server returns the storage path of the file, which can be accessed to execute arbitrary JSP code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18830", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMingsoft\u00bbMcms\u00bbVersion:4.6.5cpe:2.3:a:mingsoft:mcms:4.6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.20%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gitee.com/mingSoft/MCMS/issues/IO0IQ", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized upload vulnerability \u00b7 Issue #IO0IQ \u00b7 \u94ed\u98de/MCMS - GiteeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
