{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-2475", "Description": "Following the Gardener architecture, the Kubernetes apiserver of a Gardener managed shoot cluster resides in the corresponding seed cluster. Due to missing network isolation a shoot's apiserver can access services/endpoints in the private network of its corresponding seed cluster. Combined with other minor Kubernetes security issues, the missing network isolation theoretically can lead to compromise other shoot or seed clusters in the \"Gardener\" context. The issue is rated high due to the high impact of a potential exploitation in \"Gardener\" context. This was fixed in Gardener release 0.12.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-2475", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGardener\u00bbGardenerVersions  before (<) 0.12.4cpe:2.3:a:gardener:gardener:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.40%  0.41%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.40%  0.40%  0.00 \n 3  2023-11-07  0.40%  0.40%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-03  0.35%  0.40%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-18  0.35%  0.35%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.35%  -0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2699726", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gardener/OjfKEe1LwXo", "ref_desc": "Google GroepenMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=500633095", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Patch Day \u2013 October 2018 - Product Security Response at SAP - SCN WikiVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yoI0pifxnPLpHswKsM6-SK2UpsA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105579", "ref_desc": "Kubernetes API Server of Gardener CVE-2018-2475 Unauthorized Access VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
