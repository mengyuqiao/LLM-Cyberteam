{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-13805", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller (All versions >= V2.0 and < V2.1.6), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions >= V2.0 and < V2.5), SIMATIC S7-1500 incl. F (All versions >= V2.0 and < V2.5). An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition on the network stack by sending a large number of specially crafted packets to the PLC. The PLC will lose its ability to communicate over the network. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems. Successful exploitation requires no privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use this vulnerability to compromise availability of the network connectivity. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13805", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbSimatic Et 200sp FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 2.0cpe:2.3:o:siemens:simatic_et_200sp_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbSimatic Et 200sp\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSiemens\u00bbSimatic S7-1500 FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 2.0andbefore (<) 2.5cpe:2.3:o:siemens:simatic_s7-1500_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbSimatic S7-1500\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSiemens\u00bbSimatic S7-1500f FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 2.0andbefore (<) 2.5cpe:2.3:o:siemens:simatic_s7-1500f_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbSimatic S7-1500f\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-19  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-25  0.12%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-05-29  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-347726.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
