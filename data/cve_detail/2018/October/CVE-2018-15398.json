{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15398", "Description": "A vulnerability in the per-user-override feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass an access control list (ACL) that is configured for an interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to errors that could occur when the affected software constructs and applies per-user-override rules. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a network through an affected device that has a vulnerable configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access resources that are behind the affected device and would typically be protected by the interface ACL.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15398", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance Software\u00bbVersion:9.6(4.3)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:9.6\\(4.3\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance Software\u00bbVersion:9.4(2)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:9.4\\(2\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance Software\u00bbVersion:9.4(4)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:9.4\\(4\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat Defense\u00bbVersion:6.2.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:6.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-07-18  0.19%  0.14%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-05-22  0.36%  0.19%  -0.17 \n 4  2024-04-04  0.39%  0.36%  -0.04 \n 5  2024-02-24  0.31%  0.39%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-11-03  0.32%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-09-29  0.30%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-08-11  0.32%  0.30%  -0.02 \n 9  2023-07-08  0.20%  0.32%  +0.12 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.20%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-acl-bypass", "ref_desc": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Access Control List Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041788", "ref_desc": "Cisco ASA Lets Remote Users Bypass the Per-User-Override Firewall Feature - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105517", "ref_desc": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance CVE-2018-15398 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
