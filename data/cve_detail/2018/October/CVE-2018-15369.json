{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15369", "Description": "A vulnerability in the TACACS+ client subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted TACACS+ response packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a crafted TACACS+ packet into an existing TACACS+ session between an affected device and a TACACS+ server or by impersonating a known, valid TACACS+ server and sending a crafted TACACS+ packet to an affected device when establishing a connection to the device. To exploit this vulnerability by using either method, the attacker must know the shared TACACS+ secret and the crafted packet must be sent in response to a TACACS+ request from a TACACS+ client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15369", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIOS\u00bbVersion:15.6(1.9)tcpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.6\\(1.9\\)t:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-08-05  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-17  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105426", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software CVE-2018-15369 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-tacplus", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software TACACS+ Client Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
