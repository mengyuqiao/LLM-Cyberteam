{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15758", "Description": "Spring Security OAuth, versions 2.3 prior to 2.3.4, and 2.2 prior to 2.2.3, and 2.1 prior to 2.1.3, and 2.0 prior to 2.0.16, and older unsupported versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation under certain conditions. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the approval endpoint that can modify the previously saved authorization request and lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario can happen if the application is configured to use a custom approval endpoint that declares AuthorizationRequest as a controller method argument. This vulnerability exposes applications that meet all of the following requirements: Act in the role of an Authorization Server (e.g. @EnableAuthorizationServer) and use a custom Approval Endpoint that declares AuthorizationRequest as a controller method argument. This vulnerability does not expose applications that: Act in the role of an Authorization Server and use the default Approval Endpoint, act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. @EnableResourceServer), act in the role of a Client only (e.g. @EnableOAuthClient).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15758", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPivotal Software\u00bbSpring Security OauthVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.16cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:spring_security_oauth:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbSpring Security OauthVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:spring_security_oauth:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbSpring Security OauthVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.3cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:spring_security_oauth:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbSpring Security OauthVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.5cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:spring_security_oauth:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbSpring Security OauthVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andbefore (<) 2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:spring_security_oauth:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.34%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-07-31  0.43%  0.31%  -0.12 \n 3  2024-06-04  0.55%  0.43%  -0.12 \n 4  2024-04-17  0.52%  0.55%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-03-08  0.60%  0.52%  -0.08 \n 6  2023-11-16  0.60%  0.60%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-10-12  0.72%  0.60%  -0.12 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.51%  0.72%  +0.21 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.51%  -0.45 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15758", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-15758: Privilege Escalation in spring-security-oauth2 | Security | PivotalMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2413", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:2413 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1cgOLn10sKmizUpnnp0EWELhbM0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105687", "ref_desc": "Pivotal Spring Security OAuth CVE-2018-15758 Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
