{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-17968", "Description": "A gambling smart contract implementation for RuletkaIo, an Ethereum gambling game, generates a random value that is predictable by an external contract call. The developer wrote a random() function that uses a block timestamp and block hash from the Ethereum blockchain. This can be predicted by writing the same random function code in an exploit contract to determine the deadSeat value.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17968", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRuletkaio\u00bbRuletkaio\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:ruletkaio:ruletkaio:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.59%  0.79%  +0.20 \n 2  2023-07-10  0.41%  0.59%  +0.17 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.41%  -0.47 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TEAM-C4B/CVE-LIST/tree/master/CVE-2018-17968", "ref_desc": "CVE-LIST/CVE-2018-17968 at master \u00b7 TEAM-C4B/CVE-LIST \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
