{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15373", "Description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to exhaust memory on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper memory handling by the affected software when the software processes high rates of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets that are sent to a device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust memory on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15373", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIOS\u00bbVersion:15.5(3)s3.16cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.5\\(3\\)s3.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:15.5(3)s3.16cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:15.5\\(3\\)s3.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-28  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-02-17  0.14%  0.11%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-11-03  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 4  2023-09-29  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-094-03", "ref_desc": "Rockwell Automation Stratix 5400/5410/5700/8000/8300 and ArmorStratix 5700 | CISACVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-FZM87_PIkoM2aH9PdVhVMR8YaE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-cdp-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Cisco Discovery Protocol Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105413", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software CVE-2018-15373 Denial of Service VulnerabilityVDB Entry;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
