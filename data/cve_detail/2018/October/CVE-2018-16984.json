{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16984", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 2.1 before 2.1.2, in which unprivileged users can read the password hashes of arbitrary accounts. The read-only password widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has only the \"view\" permission (new in Django 2.1), resulting in display of the entire password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts using insecure hashes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16984", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDjangoproject\u00bbDjangoVersions  from including (>=) 2.1andbefore (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:djangoproject:django:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2024-07-17  0.16%  0.10%  -0.06 \n 3  2024-05-21  0.22%  0.16%  -0.06 \n 4  2024-02-23  0.27%  0.22%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-09-26  0.29%  0.27%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.18%  0.29%  +0.11 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190502-0009/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-16984 Django Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2018/oct/01/security-release/", "ref_desc": "Django security release issued: 2.1.2 | Weblog | DjangoVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041749", "ref_desc": "Django Password Change Flaw Lets Remote Authenticated Administrative Users View Hashed Passwords on the Target System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
