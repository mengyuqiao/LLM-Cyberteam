The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser to perform arbitrary actions with the privileges of the user on an affected system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15438", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime Collaboration Assurance\u00bbVersion:12.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:prime_collaboration_assurance:12.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 2  2024-08-01  0.17%  0.12%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.24%  0.17%  -0.07 \n 4  2024-03-09  0.28%  0.24%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-10-11  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-23  0.29%  0.27%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.16%  0.29%  +0.12 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.16%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-cpca-csrf", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105670", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance CVE-2018-15438 Cross Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041930", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Access Control Flaw Lets Remote Users Conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
