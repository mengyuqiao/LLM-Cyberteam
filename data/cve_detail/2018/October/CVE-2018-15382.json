{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15382", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to generate valid, signed session tokens. The vulnerability is due to a static signing key that is present in all Cisco HyperFlex systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the static signing key from one HyperFlex system and using it to generate valid, signed session tokens for another HyperFlex system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the HyperFlex Web UI of a system for which they are not authorized.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15382", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbHyperflex Hx Data Platform\u00bbVersion:3.0(1a)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:hyperflex_hx_data_platform:3.0\\(1a\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.10%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-08-12  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-24  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-642 External Control of Critical State Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/642/External-Control-of-Critical-State-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105518", "ref_desc": "Cisco HyperFlex Static Signing Key CVE-2018-15382 Authorization Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-hyperflex-secret", "ref_desc": "Cisco HyperFlex Software Static Signing Key VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
