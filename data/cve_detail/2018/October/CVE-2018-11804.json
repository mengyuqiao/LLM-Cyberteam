{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11804", "Description": "Spark's Apache Maven-based build includes a convenience script, 'build/mvn', that downloads and runs a zinc server to speed up compilation. It has been included in release branches since 1.3.x, up to and including master. This server will accept connections from external hosts by default. A specially-crafted request to the zinc server could cause it to reveal information in files readable to the developer account running the build. Note that this issue does not affect end users of Spark, only developers building Spark from source code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11804", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSparkVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:spark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbSparkVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0andbefore (<) 2.2.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:spark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.40%  0.24%  -0.16 \n 2  2024-08-08  0.35%  0.40%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-06-11  0.32%  0.35%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.27%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-03-16  0.35%  0.27%  -0.07 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.43%  0.35%  -0.08 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.43%  -0.53 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://spark.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2018-11804", "ref_desc": "Security | Apache SparkMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105756", "ref_desc": "Apache Spark CVE-2018-11804 Information Disclosure VulnerabilityBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/2b11aa4201e36f2ec8f728e722fe33758410f07784379cbefd0bda9d%40%3Cdev.spark.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-11804: Apache Spark build/mvn runs zinc, and can expose information from build machines-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
