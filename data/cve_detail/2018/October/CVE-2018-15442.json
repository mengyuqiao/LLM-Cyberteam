{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15442", "Description": "A vulnerability in the update service of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the update service command with a crafted argument. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with SYSTEM user privileges. While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15442", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Productivity ToolsVersions  from including (>=) 32.6.0andbefore (<) 33.0.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_productivity_tools:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings Desktop\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 33.6.4cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings_desktop:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  8.25%  7.08%  -1.17 \n 2  2024-11-08  6.71%  8.25%  +1.54 \n 3  2024-10-03  10.86%  6.71%  -4.15 \n 4  2024-07-09  31.22%  10.86%  -20.36 \n 5  2023-11-05  32.22%  31.22%  -1.00 \n 6  2023-09-15  28.91%  32.22%  +3.32 \n 7  2023-07-08  25.17%  28.91%  +3.73 \n 8  2023-03-07  32.25%  25.17%  -7.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105734", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App CVE-2018-15442 Local Command Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181024-webex-injection", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Update Service Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45695/", "ref_desc": "WebExec - (Authenticated) User Code Execution (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041942", "ref_desc": "Cisco WebEx Meetings File Processing Flaw Lets Remote Authenticated Users Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45696/", "ref_desc": "WebEx - Local Service Permissions Exploit (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
