{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18765", "Description": "An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT packet-parsing functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.13. It is a heap-based buffer over-read in mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic. A specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18765", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCesanta\u00bbMongoose\u00bbVersion:6.13cpe:2.3:a:cesanta:mongoose:6.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-20  0.22%  0.20%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/thracky/status/1059472674940993541", "ref_desc": "John Simpson on Twitter: \"So I'm about 90% certain that CVE-2018-18765 is bs and should never have been assigned a CVE.
