{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3953", "Description": "Devices in the Linksys ESeries line of routers (Linksys E1200 Firmware Version 2.0.09 and Linksys E2500 Firmware Version 3.0.04) are susceptible to OS command injection vulnerabilities due to improper filtering of data passed to and retrieved from NVRAM. Data entered into the 'Router Name' input field through the web portal is submitted to apply.cgi as the value to the 'machine_name' POST parameter. When the 'preinit' binary receives the SIGHUP signal, it enters a code path that continues until it reaches offset 0x0042B5C4 in the 'start_lltd' function. Within the 'start_lltd' function, a 'nvram_get' call is used to obtain the value of the user-controlled 'machine_name' NVRAM entry. This value is then entered directly into a command intended to write the host name to a file and subsequently executed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3953", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinksys\u00bbE1200 Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.0.09cpe:2.3:o:linksys:e1200_firmware:2.0.09:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linksys\u00bbE1200\u00bbVersion:N/A\nLinksys\u00bbE2500 Firmware\u00bbVersion:3.0.04cpe:2.3:o:linksys:e2500_firmware:3.0.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linksys\u00bbE2500\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  1.50%  +1.30 \n 2  2024-07-31  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-04  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.27%  0.19%  -0.08 \n 5  2023-06-01  0.38%  0.27%  -0.11 \n 6  2023-03-29  0.27%  0.38%  +0.11 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.06%  0.27%  -1.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0625", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0625 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uZKoAj8bZjPeGAoiN7TnoGYxmXE.html"}]}
