{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15427", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Video Surveillance Manager (VSM) Software running on certain Cisco Connected Safety and Security Unified Computing System (UCS) platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to an affected system by using the root account, which has default, static user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the presence of undocumented, default, static user credentials for the root account of the affected software on certain systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15427", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbVideo Surveillance Manager\u00bbVersion:7.11cpe:2.3:a:cisco:video_surveillance_manager:7.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM4 1-ruWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM4 2-ruWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM5 1-ruWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM5 2-ru\nCisco\u00bbVideo Surveillance Manager\u00bbVersion:7.11.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:video_surveillance_manager:7.11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM4 1-ruWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM4 2-ruWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM5 1-ruWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM5 2-ru\nCisco\u00bbVideo Surveillance Manager\u00bbVersion:7.10cpe:2.3:a:cisco:video_surveillance_manager:7.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM4 1-ruWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM4 2-ruWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM5 1-ruWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbConnected Safety And Security Ucs C220\u00bbVersion:N/AForM5 2-ru", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.41%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-07-06  0.50%  0.36%  -0.14 \n 3  2024-05-10  0.70%  0.50%  -0.21 \n 4  2024-03-23  0.77%  0.70%  -0.07 \n 5  2024-02-12  1.04%  0.77%  -0.27 \n 6  2023-11-03  1.06%  1.04%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-09-29  0.94%  1.06%  +0.12 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.56%  0.94%  +0.38 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.56%  -0.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105381", "ref_desc": "Cisco Video Surveillance Manager Appliance CVE-2018-15427 Insecure Default Password VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180921-vsm", "ref_desc": "Cisco Video Surveillance Manager Appliance Default Password VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041733", "ref_desc": "Cisco Video Surveillance Manager Default User Account Lets Remote Users Access the Target System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
