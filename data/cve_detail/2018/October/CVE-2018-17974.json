{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-17974", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Tcpreplay 4.3.0 beta1. A heap-based buffer over-read was triggered in the function dlt_en10mb_encode() of the file plugins/dlt_en10mb/en10mb.c, due to inappropriate values in the function memmove(). The length (pktlen + ctx -> l2len) can be larger than source value (packet + ctx->l2len) because the function fails to ensure the length of a packet is valid. This leads to Denial of Service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17974", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nBroadcom\u00bbTcpreplay\u00bbVersion:4.3.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:tcpreplay:4.3.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/SegfaultMasters/covering360/tree/master/tcpreplay", "ref_desc": "covering360/tcpreplay at master \u00b7 SegfaultMasters/covering360 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/issues/486", "ref_desc": "Heap overflow in dlt_en10mb_encode() \u00b7 Issue #486 \u00b7 appneta/tcpreplay \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
