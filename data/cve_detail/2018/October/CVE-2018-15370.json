{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15370", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS ROM Monitor (ROMMON) Software for Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to bypass Cisco Secure Boot validation checks and load a compromised software image on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the presence of a hidden command in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device via the console, forcing the device into ROMMON mode, and writing a malicious pattern to a specific memory address on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass signature validation checks by Cisco Secure Boot technology and load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15370", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Rom Monitor\u00bbVersion:15.1(2)sy3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_rom_monitor:15.1\\(2\\)sy3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105412", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS ROM Monitor CVE-2018-15370 Local Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-catalyst6800", "ref_desc": "Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series Switches ROM Monitor Software Secure Boot Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
