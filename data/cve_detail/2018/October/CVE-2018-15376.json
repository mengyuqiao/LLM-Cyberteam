{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15376", "Description": "A vulnerability in the embedded test subsystem of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write arbitrary values to arbitrary locations in the memory space of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the presence of certain test commands that were intended to be available only in internal development builds of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using these commands on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary values to arbitrary locations in the memory space of the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15376", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIOS\u00bbVersion:15.6(3)mcpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.6\\(3\\)m:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIOS\u00bbVersion:15.5(2.21)tcpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.5\\(2.21\\)t:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-123 Write-what-where Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/123/Write-what-where-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-ir800-memwrite", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers Arbitrary Memory Write VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_22siwmJUPmPCL7KqAQhjsizytA.html"}]}
