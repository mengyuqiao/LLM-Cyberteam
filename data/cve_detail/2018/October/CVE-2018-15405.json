{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15405", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web interface for specific feature sets of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to an authorization check that does not properly include the access level of the web interface user. An attacker who has valid application credentials could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information that belongs to other users. The attacker could then use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15405", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUcs Director\u00bbVersion:6.6(1.0)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director:6.6\\(1.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUcs Director\u00bbVersion:2.1(0.0)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director:2.1\\(0.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-11-30  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-18  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-05-22  0.11%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.08%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041779", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Computing System Director Flaw Lets Remote Authenticated Users Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-imcs-ucsd-id", "ref_desc": "Cisco Integrated Management Controller Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director Authenticated Web Interface Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
