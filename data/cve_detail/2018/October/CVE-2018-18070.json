{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18070", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Daimler Mercedes-Benz COMAND 17/13.0 50.12 on Mercedes-Benz C-Class 2018 vehicles. Defining or receiving a specific navigation route might cause the system to freeze and reboot after a few transmissions. When the system next starts, it tries to re-calculate the route, which will cause a boot loop. (Under certain circumstances, it is possible to quickly overwrite the malicious route to regain the stability of the system.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18070", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMercedes-benz\u00bbComand\u00bbVersion:17/13.0 50.12cpe:2.3:o:mercedes-benz:comand:17\\/13.0_50.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mercedes-benz\u00bbC-class\u00bbVersion:2018", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.06%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.07%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://vuldb.com/?id.125080", "ref_desc": "Daimler Mercedes Comand 17-13.0 50.12 Navigation Route Calculation Loop denial of service [Disputed]Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
