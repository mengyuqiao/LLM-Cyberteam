{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15426", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15426", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnity Connection\u00bbVersion:Vmo-11.5(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unity_connection:vmo-11.5\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-12  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-18  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-05-22  0.12%  0.08%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041781", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unity Connection Input Validation Flaw Lets Remote Users Conduct Cross-Site Scripting Attacks - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-uc-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unity Connection Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
