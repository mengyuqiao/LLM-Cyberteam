{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15372", "Description": "A vulnerability in the MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) using Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) functionality of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass authentication and pass traffic through a Layer 3 interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to and passing traffic through a Layer 3 interface of an affected device, if the interface is configured for MACsec MKA using EAP-TLS and is running in access-session closed mode. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass 802.1x network access controls and gain access to the network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15372", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.8.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.9.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.9.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-macsec", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software MACsec MKA Using EAP-TLS Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105416", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software CVE-2018-15372 Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
