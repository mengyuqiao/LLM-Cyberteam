{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3984", "Description": "An exploitable uninitialized length vulnerability exists within the Word document-parser of the Atlantis Word Processor 3.0.2.3 and 3.0.2.5. A specially crafted document can cause Atlantis to skip initializing a value representing the number of columns of a table. Later, the application will use this as a length within a loop that will write to a pointer on the heap. Due to this value being controlled, a buffer overflow will occur, which can lead to code execution under the context of the application. An attacker must convince a victim to open a document in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3984", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nAtlantiswordprocessor\u00bbAtlantis Word Processor\u00bbVersion:3.0.2.5cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.0.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlantiswordprocessor\u00bbAtlantis Word Processor\u00bbVersion:3.0.2.3cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.0.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.13%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0652", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0652 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
