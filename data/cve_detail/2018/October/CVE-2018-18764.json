{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18764", "Description": "An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT packet-parsing functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.13. It is a heap-based buffer over-read in a parse_mqtt getu16 call. A specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18764", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCesanta\u00bbMongoose\u00bbVersion:6.13cpe:2.3:a:cesanta:mongoose:6.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.14%  0.21%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.23%  0.12%  -0.11 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TiffanyBlue/PoCbyMyself/blob/master/mongoose6.13/mqtt/Cesanta%20Mongoose%20MQTT%20getu16%20heap%20buffer%20overflow1.md", "ref_desc": "PoCbyMyself/Cesanta Mongoose MQTT getu16 heap buffer overflow1.md at master \u00b7 TiffanyBlue/PoCbyMyself \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TiffanyBlue/PoCbyMyself/blob/master/mongoose6.13/mqtt/Cesanta%20Mongoose%20MQTT%20getu16%20heap%20buffer%20overflow2.md", "ref_desc": "PoCbyMyself/Cesanta Mongoose MQTT getu16 heap buffer overflow2.md at master \u00b7 TiffanyBlue/PoCbyMyself \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
