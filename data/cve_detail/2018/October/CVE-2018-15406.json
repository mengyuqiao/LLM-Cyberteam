{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15406", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15406", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUcs Director\u00bbVersion:6.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director:6.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.07%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-08-12  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-07-18  0.15%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-05-22  0.28%  0.15%  -0.13 \n 5  2024-02-24  0.24%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.16%  0.24%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-ucsd-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco UCS Director Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041783", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Computing System Director Input Validation Flaw Lets Remote Users Conduct Cross-Site Scripting Attacks - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
