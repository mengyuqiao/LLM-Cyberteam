{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15396", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Bulk Administration Tool (BAT) for Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not restrict the maximum size of certain files that can be written to disk. An attacker who has valid administrator credentials for an affected system could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, remote connection request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write a file that consumes most of the available disk space on the system, causing application functions to operate abnormally and leading to a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15396", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnity Connection\u00bbVersion:12.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unity_connection:12.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-08-12  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-18  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 4  2024-05-22  0.09%  0.08%  0.00 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-unity-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unity Connection File Upload Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041782", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unity Connection Bulk Administration Tool Validation Flaw Lets Remote Authenticated Users Consume Excessive Memory Resources - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
