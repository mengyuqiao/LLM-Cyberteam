{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18013", "Description": "* Xen Mobile through 10.8.0 includes a service listening on port 5001 within its firewall that accepts unauthenticated input. If this service is supplied with raw serialised Java objects, it deserialises them back into Java objects in memory, giving rise to a remote code execution vulnerability.  NOTE: the vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability, stating it is \"already mitigated by the internal firewall that limits access to configuration services to localhost.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18013", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCitrix\u00bbXenmobile ServerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 10.8.0cpe:2.3:a:citrix:xenmobile_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.43%  0.25%  -0.18 \n 2  2024-11-08  0.32%  0.43%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-10-03  0.27%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-09-02  0.12%  0.27%  +0.15 \n 5  2024-05-19  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.12%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://advisories.dxw.com/advisories/xen-mobile-vulnerable-to-code-execution-via-object-serialisation/", "ref_desc": "Untrusted deserialisation in Xen Mobile 10.6 through 10.8 allows network adjacent unauthenticated users to remotely execute code \u2013 dxw advisoriesExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
