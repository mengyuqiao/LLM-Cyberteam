{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15399", "Description": "A vulnerability in the TCP syslog module of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust the 1550-byte buffers on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a missing boundary check in an internal function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a man-in-the-middle position between an affected device and its configured TCP syslog server and then maliciously modifying the TCP header in segments that are sent from the syslog server to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust buffer on the affected device and cause all TCP-based features to stop functioning, resulting in a DoS condition. The affected TCP-based features include AnyConnect SSL VPN, clientless SSL VPN, and management connections such as Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet, and HTTPS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15399", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance Software\u00bbVersion:9.4(4)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:9.4\\(4\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance Software\u00bbVersion:9.8(2)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:9.8\\(2\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat Defense\u00bbVersion:6.2.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:6.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-08-12  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-07-18  0.12%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-05-22  0.15%  0.12%  -0.04 \n 5  2024-02-24  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041785", "ref_desc": "Cisco ASA Bug in TCP Syslog Module Lets Remote Users Cause the Target Service to Crash - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-syslog-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance TCP Syslog Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
