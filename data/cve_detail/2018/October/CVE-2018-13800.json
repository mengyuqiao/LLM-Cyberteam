{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-13800", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family version 4 (All versions < V4.2.3). The web interface could allow a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if an unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link. Successful exploitation requires user interaction by a legitimate user, who must be authenticated to the web interface. A successful attack could allow an attacker to trigger actions via the web interface that the legitimate user is allowed to perform. This could allow the attacker to read or modify parts of the device configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13800", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbSimatic S7-1200 V4 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.2.3cpe:2.3:o:siemens:simatic_s7-1200_v4_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbSimatic S7-1200 V4\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-24  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-05-28  0.09%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.05%  0.09%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-507847.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105542", "ref_desc": "Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU Products CVE-2018-13800 Cross Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
