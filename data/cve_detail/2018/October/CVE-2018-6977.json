{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6977", "Description": "VMware ESXi (6.7, 6.5, 6.0), Workstation (15.x and 14.x) and Fusion (11.x and 10.x) contain a denial-of-service vulnerability due to an infinite loop in a 3D-rendering shader. Successfully exploiting this issue may allow an attacker with normal user privileges in the guest to make the VM unresponsive, and in some cases, possibly result other VMs on the host or the host itself becoming unresponsive.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6977", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbWorkstationVersions  from including (>=) 14.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 14.1.5cpe:2.3:a:vmware:workstation:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbWorkstationVersions  from including (>=) 15.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.0.2cpe:2.3:a:vmware:workstation:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbFusionVersions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 11.0.2cpe:2.3:a:vmware:fusion:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbFusionVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 10.1.5cpe:2.3:a:vmware:fusion:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbEsxi\u00bbVersion:6.0cpe:2.3:o:vmware:esxi:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbEsxi\u00bbVersion:6.5cpe:2.3:o:vmware:esxi:6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbEsxi\u00bbVersion:6.7cpe:2.3:o:vmware:esxi:6.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-03  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2018-0025.html", "ref_desc": "VMSA-2018-0025Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041822", "ref_desc": "VMware ESXi 3D-Acceleration Feature Lets Local Users on a Guest System Cause Denial of Service Conditions on the Host System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041821", "ref_desc": "VMware 3D-Acceleration Feature Lets Local Users on a Guest System Cause Denial of Service Conditions on the Host System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105549", "ref_desc": "Multiple VMware Products CVE-2018-6977 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
