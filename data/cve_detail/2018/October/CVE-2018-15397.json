{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15397", "Description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) over IPsec functionality in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to an error that may occur if the affected software renegotiates the encryption key for an IPsec tunnel when certain TFC traffic is in flight. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious stream of TFC traffic through an established IPsec tunnel on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a daemon process on the affected device to crash, which could cause the device to crash and result in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15397", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance Software\u00bbVersion:9.6.4cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:9.6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance Software\u00bbVersion:9.8.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:9.8.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance Software\u00bbVersion:9.9.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:9.9.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance Software\u00bbVersion:9.9.1(1)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:9.9.1\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.2.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-08-12  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-07-18  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-05-22  0.18%  0.14%  -0.05 \n 5  2024-02-24  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-320", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/320/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041786", "ref_desc": "Cisco ASA Traffic Flow Confidentiality Processing Bug Lets Remote Users Cause the Target System to Crash - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-ipsec-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance IPsec VPN Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
