{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6928", "Description": "Drupal core 7.x versions before 7.57 when using Drupal's private file system, Drupal will check to make sure a user has access to a file before allowing the user to view or download it. This check fails under certain conditions in which one module is trying to grant access to the file and another is trying to deny it, leading to an access bypass vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for unusual site configurations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6928", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 7.0andbefore (<) 7.57cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4123", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4123-1 drupal7Issue TrackingCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/J1_AQTkyoqYUeFvGhmBzVGs22xY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-001", "ref_desc": "Access to this page has been denied.Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qa_q8KlQClb9ZKoNhdc74g6QpFY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/02/msg00030.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1295-1] drupal7 security updateThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sW3K5OHYSJhxc1cqYGmpdRWaerQ.html"}]}
