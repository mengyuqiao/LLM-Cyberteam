{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8076", "Description": "ZenMate 1.5.4 for macOS suffers from a type confusion vulnerability within the com.zenmate.chron-xpc LaunchDaemon component. The LaunchDaemon implements an XPC service that uses an insecure XPC API for accessing data from an inbound XPC message. This could potentially result in an XPC object of the wrong type being passed as the first argument to the xpc_connection_create_from_endpoint function if controlled by an attacker. In recent versions of macOS and OS X, Apple has implemented an internal check to prevent such XPC API abuse from occurring, thus making this vulnerability only result in a denial of service if exploited by an attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8076", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nZenmate\u00bbZenmate\u00bbVersion:1.5.4ForMacoscpe:2.3:a:zenmate:zenmate:1.5.4:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-01-23  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-704 Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/704/Incorrect-Type-Conversion-or-Cast.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/VerSprite/research/blob/master/advisories/VS-2018-016.md", "ref_desc": "research/VS-2018-016.md at master \u00b7 VerSprite/research \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
