{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14885", "Description": "In Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android, with all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, wma_unified_link_peer_stats_event_handler function has a variable num_rates which represents the sum of all the peer_stats->num_rates. The current behavior in this function is to validate only the num_rates of the first peer stats (peer_stats->num_rates) against WMA_SVC_MSG_MAX_SIZE, but not the sum of all the peer's num_rates (num_rates) which may lead to a buffer overflow when the firmware buffer is copied in to the allocated buffer (peer_stats) as the size for the memory allocation - link_stats_results_size is based on num_rates.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14885", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:google:android:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-03-01", "ref_desc": "Android Security Bulletin\u2014March 2018 \u00a0|\u00a0 Android Open Source ProjectVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MBS4i-PRMh46meHircu97alk1OQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/platform/vendor/qcom-opensource/wlan/qcacld-3.0/commit/?id=44e992e169dbd601f95e845961cb2181b167a553", "ref_desc": "platform/vendor/qcom-opensource/wlan/qcacld-3.0 - Unnamed repositoryPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103254", "ref_desc": "Google Android Qualcomm Component Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesVDB Entry;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ug8irEK-hwJ2B00MRMtyoQYe6e4.html"}]}
