{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3741", "Description": "There is a possible XSS vulnerability in all rails-html-sanitizer gem versions below 1.0.4 for Ruby. The gem allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized output when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments, and these attributes can lead to an XSS attack on target applications. This issue is similar to CVE-2018-8048 in Loofah. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3741", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRubyonrails\u00bbHtml Sanitizer\u00bbForRubyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.3cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:html_sanitizer:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-02-07  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/commit/f3ba1a839a35f2ba7f941c15e239a1cb379d56ae", "ref_desc": "Make sure we address CVE-2018-8048 \u00b7 rails/rails-html-sanitizer@f3ba1a8 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
