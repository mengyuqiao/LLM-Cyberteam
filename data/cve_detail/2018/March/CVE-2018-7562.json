{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7562", "Description": "A remote code execution issue was discovered in GLPI through 9.2.1. There is a race condition that allows temporary access to an uploaded executable file that will be disallowed. The application allows an authenticated user to upload a file when he/she creates a new ticket via front/fileupload.php. This feature is protected using different types of security features like the check on the file's extension. However, the application uploads and creates a file, though this file is not allowed, and then deletes the file in the uploadFiles method in inc/glpiuploaderhandler.class.php.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7562", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.2.1cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.47%  0.47%  0.00 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.48%  0.47%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-06-15  0.48%  0.48%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-05-07  0.51%  0.48%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-01-20  0.36%  0.51%  +0.15 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.54%  0.36%  -0.17 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.17%  0.54%  -1.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://membership.backbox.org/glpi-9-2-1-multiple-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "GLPI 9.2.1, Multiple Vulnerabilities - BackBox.org MembershipPermissions RequiredCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/31VjqUYdRWxoZQdg82nLzLTdZZY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/pull/3650", "ref_desc": "Improve checks on read files directory by trasher \u00b7 Pull Request #3650 \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
