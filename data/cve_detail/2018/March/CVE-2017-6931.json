{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6931", "Description": "In Drupal versions 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 the Settings Tray module has a vulnerability that allows users to update certain data that they do not have the permissions for. If you have implemented a Settings Tray form in contrib or a custom module, the correct access checks should be added. This release fixes the only two implementations in core, but does not harden against other such bypasses. This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the Settings Tray module.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6931", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 8.4.0andbefore (<) 8.4.5cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-001", "ref_desc": "Access to this page has been denied.Mitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qa_q8KlQClb9ZKoNhdc74g6QpFY.html"}]}
