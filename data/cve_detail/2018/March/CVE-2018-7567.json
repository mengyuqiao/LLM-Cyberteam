NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue stating \"the behaviour is as designed and needed for different packages to be installed\", \"there is a security warning if the package is not verified by OTRS Group\", and \"there is the possibility and responsibility of an admin to check packages before installation which is possible as they are not binary.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7567", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOtrs\u00bbOtrsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.0.23cpe:2.3:a:otrs:otrs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOtrs\u00bbOtrs\u00bbVersion:6.0.0cpe:2.3:a:otrs:otrs:6.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOtrs\u00bbOtrs\u00bbVersion:6.0.1cpe:2.3:a:otrs:otrs:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.53% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.38%  0.53%  +0.15 \n 2  2024-10-05  0.39%  0.38%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-06-07  0.39%  0.39%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-04-29  0.42%  0.39%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-03-19  0.37%  0.42%  +0.05 \n 6  2024-01-12  0.36%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.38%  0.36%  -1.02 \n 8  2023-01-28  1.27%  1.38%  +0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://0day.today/exploit/29938", "ref_desc": "Just a moment...Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
