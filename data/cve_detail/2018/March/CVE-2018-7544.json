{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7544", "Description": "A cross-protocol scripting issue was discovered in the management interface in OpenVPN through 2.4.5. When this interface is enabled over TCP without a password, and when no other clients are connected to this interface, attackers can execute arbitrary management commands, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service (SIGTERM) by triggering XMLHttpRequest actions in a web browser. This is demonstrated by a multipart/form-data POST to http://localhost:23000 with a \"signal SIGTERM\" command in a TEXTAREA element. NOTE: The vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability. They state that this is the result of improper configuration of the OpenVPN instance rather than an intrinsic vulnerability, and now more explicitly warn against such configurations in both the management-interface documentation, and with a runtime warning", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7544", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpenvpn\u00bbOpenvpnVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.4.5cpe:2.3:a:openvpn:openvpn:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.39%  +0.07 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.33%  -0.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-134 Use of Externally-Controlled Format String", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/134/Use-of-Externally-Controlled-Format-String.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://blog.0xlabs.com/2018/03/openvpn-remote-information-disclosure.html", "ref_desc": "0xlabs | Blog: OpenVPN: Remote Information Disclosure and Denial Of Service (CVE-2018-7544)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
