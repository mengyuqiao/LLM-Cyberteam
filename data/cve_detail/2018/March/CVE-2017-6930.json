{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6930", "Description": "In Drupal versions 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 when using node access controls with a multilingual site, Drupal marks the untranslated version of a node as the default fallback for access queries. This fallback is used for languages that do not yet have a translated version of the created node. This can result in an access bypass vulnerability. This issue is mitigated by the fact that it only applies to sites that a) use the Content Translation module; and b) use a node access module such as Domain Access which implement hook_node_access_records().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6930", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 8.4.0andbefore (<) 8.4.5cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.26%  -0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-001", "ref_desc": "Access to this page has been denied.Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qa_q8KlQClb9ZKoNhdc74g6QpFY.html"}]}
