{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7890", "Description": "A remote code execution issue was discovered in Zoho ManageEngine Applications Manager before 13.6 (build 13640). The publicly accessible testCredential.do endpoint takes multiple user inputs and validates supplied credentials by accessing a specified system. This endpoint calls several internal classes, and then executes a PowerShell script. If the specified system is OfficeSharePointServer, then the username and password parameters to this script are not validated, leading to Command Injection.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7890", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nZohocorp\u00bbManageengine Applications ManagerVersions  before (<) 13.6cpe:2.3:a:zohocorp:manageengine_applications_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.19%  96.50%  -0.69 \n 2  2024-11-18  97.17%  97.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-09  97.15%  97.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-07-23  97.22%  97.15%  -0.07 \n 5  2024-06-11  97.19%  97.22%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-05-03  97.13%  97.19%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-03-23  97.06%  97.13%  +0.07 \n 8  2024-02-16  97.13%  97.06%  -0.06 \n 9  2024-01-16  97.19%  97.13%  -0.07 \n 10  2023-12-22  97.18%  97.19%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-11-22  97.12%  97.18%  +0.06 \n 12  2023-10-26  97.01%  97.12%  +0.11 \n 13  2023-10-02  96.81%  97.01%  +0.20 \n 14  2023-09-08  97.31%  96.81%  -0.50 \n 15  2023-08-20  97.37%  97.31%  -0.06 \n 16  2023-07-30  97.38%  97.37%  -0.01 \n 17  2023-07-08  97.40%  97.38%  -0.02 \n 18  2023-06-17  97.40%  97.40%  0.00 \n 19  2023-05-13  97.48%  97.40%  -0.07 \n 20  2023-04-25  97.49%  97.48%  -0.01 \n 21  2023-03-20  97.47%  97.49%  +0.02 \n 22  2023-03-07  82.64%  97.47%  +14.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.manageengine.com/products/applications_manager/security-updates/security-updates-cve-2018-7890.html", "ref_desc": "Security Updates - CVE Details | ManageEngine Applications Manager", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/9684", "ref_desc": "Adding ManageEngine Application Manager RCE by mmetince \u00b7 Pull Request #9684 \u00b7 rapid7/metasploit-framework \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pentest.blog/advisory-manageengine-applications-manager-remote-code-execution-sqli-and/", "ref_desc": "Advisory | ManageEngine Applications Manager Remote Code Execution and SQLi \u2013 Pentest BlogExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44274/", "ref_desc": "ManageEngine Applications Manager 13.5 - Remote Code Execution (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103358", "ref_desc": "ManageEngine Applications Manager CVE-2018-7890 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pitstop.manageengine.com/portal/community/topic/security-vulnerability-issues-fixed-upgrade-to-the-latest-version-of-applications-manager", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerability issues fixed.
