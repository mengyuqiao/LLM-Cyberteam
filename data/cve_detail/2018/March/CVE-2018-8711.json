{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8711", "Description": "A local file inclusion issue was discovered in the WooCommerce Products Filter (aka WOOF) plugin before 2.2.0 for WordPress, as demonstrated by the shortcode parameter in a woof_redraw_woof action. The vulnerability is due to the lack of args/input validation on render_html before allowing it to be called by extract(), a PHP built-in function. Because of this, the supplied args/input can be used to overwrite the $pagepath variable, which then could lead to a local file inclusion attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8711", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nWoocommerce-filter\u00bbWoocommerce Products Filter\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.2.0cpe:2.3:a:woocommerce-filter:woocommerce_products_filter:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-03-15  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-09  0.20%  0.14%  -0.06 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.20%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.woocommerce-filter.com/update-woocommerce-products-filter-v-2-2-0/", "ref_desc": "Update WooCommerce Products Filter v.2.2.0 - WooCommerce Products FilterVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/has12jsTjtUxq-43SYOsbqDEJ94.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/arbitrary-shortcode-execution-local-file-inclusion-in-woof-pluginus-net/index.html", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary Shortcode Execution & Local File Inclusion in WOOF (PluginUs.Net) \u2013 SEC ConsultThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/p4vqx1dgpcG_muK3ogi_IBUMw74.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-products-filter/#developers", "ref_desc": "WOOF \u2013 Products Filter for WooCommerce \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.orgRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wvzr9-35Qr3KVo2oP0aWbULJkgU.html"}]}
