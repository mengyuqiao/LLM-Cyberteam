{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-6658", "Description": "Applications in cf-release before 245 can be configured and pushed with a user-provided custom buildpack using a URL pointing to the buildpack. Although it is not recommended, a user can specify a credential in the URL (basic auth or OAuth) to access the buildpack through the CLI. For example, the user could include a GitHub username and password in the URL to access a private repo. Because the URL to access the buildpack is stored unencrypted, an operator with privileged access to the Cloud Controller database could view these credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6658", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nPivotal Software\u00bbCloud Foundry Elastic RuntimeVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.0andbefore (<) 1.7.31cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:cloud_foundry_elastic_runtime:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbCloud Foundry Elastic RuntimeVersions  from including (>=) 1.8.0andbefore (<) 1.8.11cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:cloud_foundry_elastic_runtime:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbCloud Foundry Elastic RuntimeVersions  before (<) 1.6.49cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:cloud_foundry_elastic_runtime:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCloudfoundry\u00bbCf-releaseVersions  before (<) 245cpe:2.3:a:cloudfoundry:cf-release:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-6658", "ref_desc": "CVE-2016-6658 Incomplete fix for Credential Vulnerability for Custom Buildpacks | Security | PivotalVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
