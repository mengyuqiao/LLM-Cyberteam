{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8811", "Description": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in system/workplace/admin/accounts/user_role.jsp in OpenCMS 10.5.3 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrative users for requests that perform privilege escalation. Note: It is argued that OpenCMS allows only registered users to upload different kind of content artifacts (SVG, .doc, .docx). The uploaded content is stored in the CMS content repository \"as is\". In case of scripts inside an SVG, this may or may not be \"malicious\", there is no way of knowing if the uploaded SVG contains the script for a reason. To exploit the \"issue\", a user must have an account in the CMS as a content manager", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8811", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAlkacon\u00bbOpencms\u00bbVersion:10.5.3cpe:2.3:a:alkacon:opencms:10.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.40%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-02-28  0.49%  0.34%  -0.14 \n 3  2023-08-11  0.58%  0.49%  -0.09 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.47%  0.58%  +0.11 \n 5  2023-04-18  0.33%  0.47%  +0.14 \n 6  2023-03-14  0.34%  0.33%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  8.38%  0.34%  -8.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/alkacon/opencms-core/issues/586", "ref_desc": "Cross Site Request Forgery Vulnerability in OpenCMS 10.5.3 \u00b7 Issue #586 \u00b7 alkacon/opencms-core \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44391/", "ref_desc": "OpenCMS 10.5.3 - Cross-Site Request ForgeryExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
