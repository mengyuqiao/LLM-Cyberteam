{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1000125", "Description": "inversoft prime-jwt version prior to version 1.3.0 or prior to commit 0d94dcef0133d699f21d217e922564adbb83a227 contains an input validation vulnerability in JWTDecoder.decode that can result in a JWT that is decoded and thus implicitly validated even if it lacks a valid signature. This attack appear to be exploitable via an attacker crafting a token with a valid header and body and then requests it to be validated. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.3.0 and later or after commit 0d94dcef0133d699f21d217e922564adbb83a227.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000125", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nInversoft\u00bbPrime-jwtVersions  before (<) 1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:inversoft:prime-jwt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-17  0.20%  0.25%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-04-25  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-15  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-09  0.25%  0.17%  -0.08 \n 5  2023-08-04  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/inversoft/prime-jwt/issues/2", "ref_desc": "The library does not check the situation if signature algorithm is defined but no signature is provided \u00b7 Issue #2 \u00b7 FusionAuth/fusionauth-jwt \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/inversoft/prime-jwt/blob/master/CHANGES", "ref_desc": "fusionauth-jwt/CHANGES at master \u00b7 FusionAuth/fusionauth-jwt \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
