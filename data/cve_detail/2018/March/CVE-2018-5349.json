{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5349", "Description": "A vulnerability has been found in Heimdal PRO v2.2.190, but it is most likely also present in Heimdal FREE and Heimdal CORP. Faulty permissions on the directory \"C:\\ProgramData\\Heimdal Security\\Heimdal Agent\" allow BUILTIN\\Users to write new files to the directory. On startup, the process Heimdal.MonitorServices.exe running as SYSTEM will attempt to load version.dll from this directory. Placing a malicious version.dll in this directory will result in privilege escalation. NOTE: any affected Heimdal products are completely unrelated to the Heimdal vendor of a Kerberos 5 product on the h5l.org web site.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5349", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nHeimdalsecurity\u00bbHeimdal\u00bbVersion:2.2.190    PROEditioncpe:2.3:a:heimdalsecurity:heimdal:2.2.190:*:*:*:pro:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://improsec.com/blog/heimdal-advisory-1", "ref_desc": "Privilege Escalation in Heimdal #1 \u2014 Improsec | improving securityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
