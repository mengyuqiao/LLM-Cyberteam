{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-9105", "Description": "NordVPN 3.3.10 for macOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The vulnerability stems from its privileged helper tool's implemented XPC service. This XPC service is responsible for receiving and processing new OpenVPN connection requests from the main application. Unfortunately this XPC service is not protected, which allows arbitrary applications to connect and send it XPC messages. An attacker can send a crafted XPC message to the privileged helper tool requesting it make a new OpenVPN connection. Because he or she controls the contents of the XPC message, the attacker can specify the location of the openvpn executable, which could point to something malicious they control located on disk. Without validation of the openvpn executable, this will give the attacker code execution in the context of the privileged helper tool.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9105", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nNordvpn\u00bbNordvpn\u00bbVersion:3.3.10ForMacoscpe:2.3:a:nordvpn:nordvpn:3.3.10:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.17%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.19%  0.18%  0.00 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.13%  0.19%  +0.05 \n 6  2024-02-04  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 7  2024-01-10  0.16%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-08-18  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.30%  0.17%  -1.13 \n 10  2023-02-20  1.19%  1.30%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140939", "ref_desc": "NordVPN for macOS XPC service privilege escalation CVE-2018-9105 Vulnerability ReportThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/VerSprite/research/blob/master/advisories/VS-2018-015.md", "ref_desc": "research/VS-2018-015.md at master \u00b7 VerSprite/research \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
