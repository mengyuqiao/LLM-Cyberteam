{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16956", "Description": "The AjaxControl component of Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal 10.3.3 does not validate the names of pages when processing page rename requests. Pages can be renamed to include characters unsupported for URIs by the web server hosting the WCI Portal software (such as IIS). Renaming pages to include unsupported characters, such as 0x7f, prevents these pages from being accessed over the web server, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) to the page. NOTE: this CVE is assigned by MITRE and isn't validated by Oracle because Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal is out of support.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16956", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOracle\u00bbWebcenter Interaction\u00bbVersion:10.3.3cpe:2.3:a:oracle:webcenter_interaction:10.3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-08  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-07-24  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105350", "ref_desc": "Oracle WebCenter Interaction Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/C6wZe3MYWIpQfCVSl6poRXDHM_Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Sep/22", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Oracle WebCenter Interaction 10.3.3Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cDijsANgcyynmnXfSyD8oS2WbqQ.html"}]}
