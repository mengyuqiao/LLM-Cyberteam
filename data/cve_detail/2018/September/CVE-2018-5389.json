{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5389", "Description": "The Internet Key Exchange v1 main mode is vulnerable to offline dictionary or brute force attacks. Reusing a key pair across different versions and modes of IKE could lead to cross-protocol authentication bypasses. It is well known, that the aggressive mode of IKEv1 PSK is vulnerable to offline dictionary or brute force attacks. For the main mode, however, only an online attack against PSK authentication was thought to be feasible. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to recover a weak Pre-Shared Key or enable the impersonation of a victim host or network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5389", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIetf\u00bbInternet Key Exchange\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:ietf:internet_key_exchange:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.38%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-06-25  0.21%  0.31%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-08-31  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.20%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-323 Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/323/Reusing-a-Nonce-Key-Pair-in-Encryption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://web-in-security.blogspot.com/2018/08/practical-dictionary-attack-on-ipsec-ike.html", "ref_desc": "On Web-Security and -Insecurity: Practical Dictionary Attack on IPsec IKEExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-felsch.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blogs.cisco.com/security/great-cipher-but-where-did-you-get-that-key", "ref_desc": "Great Cipher, But Where Did You Get That Key? - Cisco BlogThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K42378447", "ref_desc": "IPsec IKEv1 vulnerability CVE-2018-5389", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/857035", "ref_desc": "VU#857035 - IKEv1 Main Mode vulnerable to brute force attacksThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
