{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3825", "Description": "In Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) versions prior to 1.1.4 a default master encryption key is used in the process of granting ZooKeeper access to Elasticsearch clusters. Unless explicitly overwritten, this master key is predictable across all ECE deployments. If an attacker can connect to ZooKeeper directly they would be able to access configuration information of other tenants if their cluster ID is known.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3825", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbElastic Cloud EnterpriseVersions  before (<) 1.1.4cpe:2.3:a:elastic:elastic_cloud_enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1188/Initialization-of-a-Resource-with-an-Insecure-Default.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-cloud-enterprise-1-1-4-security-update/135778", "ref_desc": "Elastic Cloud Enterprise 1.1.4 security update - Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BgMYS8B1EVOtjRVWcXHD4dFo3OE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.elastic.co/community/security", "ref_desc": "Elastic Stack Security Disclosures \u00b7 Report Issues | ElasticVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RMrGSY_VFXOZ71yMK5E8GE1-n1E.html"}]}
