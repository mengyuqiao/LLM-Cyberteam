{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16949", "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2. Several data types used as RPC input variables were implemented as unbounded array types, limited only by the inherent 32-bit length field to 4 GB. An unauthenticated attacker could send, or claim to send, large input values and consume server resources waiting for those inputs, denying service to other valid connections.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16949", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenafs\u00bbOpenafsVersions  before (<) 1.6.23cpe:2.3:a:openafs:openafs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenafs\u00bbOpenafsVersions  from including (>=) 1.8.0andbefore (<) 1.8.2cpe:2.3:a:openafs:openafs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.61%  0.79%  +0.18 \n 2  2024-06-27  1.51%  0.61%  -0.91 \n 3  2024-05-01  2.94%  1.51%  -1.43 \n 4  2024-03-14  3.44%  2.94%  -0.50 \n 5  2024-02-02  4.22%  3.44%  -0.79 \n 6  2023-12-21  4.23%  4.22%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-10-10  4.26%  4.23%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-09-05  6.02%  4.26%  -1.76 \n 9  2023-07-08  3.11%  6.02%  +2.91 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  3.11%  +2.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00024.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1513-1] openafs security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-y22DiDX8mjfwnJ1F-mXvScxAwc.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106375", "ref_desc": "OpenAFS CVE-2018-16949 Multiple Denial of Service VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://openafs.org/pages/security/OPENAFS-SA-2018-003.txt", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4302", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4302-1 openafsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WCIOHyVniawCxNUoaJZ1btIGJ38.html"}]}
