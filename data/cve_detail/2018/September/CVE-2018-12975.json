{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12975", "Description": "The random() function of the smart contract implementation for CryptoSaga, an Ethereum game, generates a random value with publicly readable variables such as timestamp, the current block's blockhash, and a private variable (which can be read with a getStorageAt call). Therefore, attackers can precompute the random number and manipulate the game (e.g., get powerful characters or get critical damages).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12975", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCryptosaga\u00bbCryptosaga\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cryptosaga:cryptosaga:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-08  0.59%  0.17%  -0.42 \n 2  2023-06-11  0.41%  0.59%  +0.17 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.41%  -0.47 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/@jonghyk.song/create-legendary-champs-by-breaking-prng-of-cryptosaga-an-ethereum-rpg-game-cve-2018-12975-8de733ff8255", "ref_desc": "Create legendary champs by breaking PRNG of Cryptosaga, an Ethereum RPG game (CVE-2018\u201312975)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
