{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-7069", "Description": "An issue has been found in dnsdist before 1.2.0 in the way EDNS0 OPT records are handled when parsing responses from a backend. When dnsdist is configured to add EDNS Client Subnet to a query, the response may contain an EDNS0 OPT record that has to be removed before forwarding the response to the initial client. On a 32-bit system, the pointer arithmetic used when parsing the received response to remove that record might trigger an undefined behavior leading to a crash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-7069", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nPowerdns\u00bbDnsdist\u00bb   X86EditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:powerdns:dnsdist:*:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.31%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-06-26  0.35%  0.25%  -0.10 \n 3  2024-04-30  0.65%  0.35%  -0.30 \n 4  2024-03-13  0.79%  0.65%  -0.14 \n 5  2024-02-02  0.79%  0.79%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-10-10  1.11%  0.79%  -0.32 \n 7  2023-09-05  0.81%  1.11%  +0.30 \n 8  2023-07-18  0.87%  0.81%  -0.05 \n 9  2023-07-08  0.54%  0.87%  +0.33 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.54%  -0.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2017-01.html", "ref_desc": "PowerDNS Security Advisory 2017-01 for dnsdist: Crafted backend responses can cause a denial of service \u2014 dnsdist documentationPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100509", "ref_desc": "dnsdist CVE-2016-7069 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-7069", "ref_desc": "1483870 \u2013 (CVE-2016-7069) CVE-2016-7069 dnsdist: Crafted backend responses can cause a denial of serviceIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
