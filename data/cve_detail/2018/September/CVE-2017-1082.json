{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1082", "Description": "In FreeBSD 11.x before 11.1-RELEASE and 10.x before 10.4-RELEASE, the qsort algorithm has a deterministic recursion pattern. Feeding a pathological input to the algorithm can lead to excessive stack usage and potential overflow. Applications that use qsort to handle large data set may crash if the input follows the pathological pattern.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1082", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nFreebsd\u00bbFreebsdVersions  from including (>=) 11.0andbefore (<) 11.1cpe:2.3:o:freebsd:freebsd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFreebsd\u00bbFreebsdVersions  from including (>=) 10.0andup to, including, (<=) 10.4cpe:2.3:o:freebsd:freebsd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.53% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.35%  0.53%  +0.19 \n 2  2024-02-09  0.45%  0.35%  -0.10 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.45%  -0.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VfD1GuJSgRjrqAUikrI85PvulPk.html"}]}
