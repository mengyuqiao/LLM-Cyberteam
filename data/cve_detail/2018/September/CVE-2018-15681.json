{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15681", "Description": "An issue was discovered in BTITeam XBTIT 2.5.4. When a user logs in, their password hash is rehashed using a predictable salt and stored in the \"pass\" cookie, which is not flagged as HTTPOnly. Due to the weak and predictable salt that is in place, an attacker who successfully steals this cookie can efficiently brute-force it to retrieve the user's cleartext password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15681", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBtiteam\u00bbXbtit\u00bbVersion:2.5.4cpe:2.3:a:btiteam:xbtit:2.5.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.60%  1.21%  +0.61 \n 2  2023-04-01  0.82%  0.60%  -0.22 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.82%  -0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://rastating.github.io/xbtit-multiple-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities in XBTIT Torrent Tracker | rastating.github.ioExploit;Mitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TmeJCS0bm_ikU2p_dlC3wQv7yX8.html"}]}
