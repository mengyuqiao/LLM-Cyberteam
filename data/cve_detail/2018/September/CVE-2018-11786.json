{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11786", "Description": "In Apache Karaf prior to 4.2.0 release, if the sshd service in Karaf is left on so an administrator can manage the running instance, any user with rights to the Karaf console can pivot and read/write any file on the file system to which the Karaf process user has access. This can be locked down a bit by using chroot to change the root directory to protect files outside of the Karaf install directory; it can be further locked down by defining a security manager policy that limits file system access to those directories beneath the Karaf home that are necessary for the system to run. However, this still allows anyone with ssh access to the Karaf process to read and write a large number of files as the Karaf process user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11786", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbKarafVersions  before (<) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.08%  -0.10 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5b7ac762c6bbe77ac5d9389f093fc6dbf196c36d788e3d7629e6c1d9@%3Cdev.karaf.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] New security advisory for CVE-2018-11786 released for Apache Karaf - Pony MailMailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-5427", "ref_desc": "[KARAF-5427] Add RBAC support for reflection invocation and redirections in the console - ASF JIRAIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2018-11786.txt", "ref_desc": "Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
