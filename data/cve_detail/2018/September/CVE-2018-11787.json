{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11787", "Description": "In Apache Karaf version prior to 3.0.9, 4.0.9, 4.1.1, when the webconsole feature is installed in Karaf, it is available at .../system/console and requires authentication to access it. One part of the console is a Gogo shell/console that gives access to the command line console of Karaf via a Web browser, and when navigated to it is available at .../system/console/gogo. Trying to go directly to that URL does require authentication. And optional bundle that some applications use is the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and perhaps others. When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL .../gogo/, and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated users. A mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle that is installed with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the console from the .../system/console application, not only from the unauthenticated endpoint. One could also stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other components/applications may require it and so their functionality would be reduced/compromised.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11787", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbKarafVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.0.9cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbKarafVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.1.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbKarafVersions  before (<) 3.0.9cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbKaraf\u00bbVersion:4.0.0UpdateMilestone1cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:4.0.0:milestone1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbKaraf\u00bbVersion:4.0.0UpdateMilestone3cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:4.0.0:milestone3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbKaraf\u00bbVersion:4.0.0UpdateMilestone2cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:4.0.0:milestone2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d9ba4c3104ba32225646879a057b75b54430f349c246c85469037d3c@%3Cdev.karaf.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] New security advisory for CVE-2018-11787 released for Apache Karaf - Pony MailIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2018-11787.txt", "ref_desc": "Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-4993", "ref_desc": "[KARAF-4993] Unsecured access to gogo console over web - ASF JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
