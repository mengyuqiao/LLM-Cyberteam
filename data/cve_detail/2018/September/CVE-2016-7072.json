{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-7072", "Description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server before 3.4.11 and 4.0.2 allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service by opening a large number of TCP connections to the web server. If the web server runs out of file descriptors, it triggers an exception and terminates the whole PowerDNS process. While it's more complicated for an unauthorized attacker to make the web server run out of file descriptors since its connection will be closed just after being accepted, it might still be possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-7072", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPowerdns\u00bbAuthoritativeVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.0.2cpe:2.3:a:powerdns:authoritative:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPowerdns\u00bbAuthoritativeVersions  before (<) 3.4.11cpe:2.3:a:powerdns:authoritative:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.78% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.97%  0.78%  -0.19 \n 2  2024-06-25  0.71%  0.97%  +0.25 \n 3  2024-02-01  0.50%  0.71%  +0.21 \n 4  2023-09-04  0.37%  0.50%  +0.14 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.35%  0.37%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.35%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3764", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3764-1 pdnsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gRoJxHrrgf5T-4DdHQBwgMfeM8o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://doc.powerdns.com/md/security/powerdns-advisory-2016-03/", "ref_desc": "Advisory 2016-03Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-7072", "ref_desc": "1627328 \u2013 (CVE-2016-7072) CVE-2016-7072 pdns: Denial of service via the web serverIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
