{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16307", "Description": "An \"Out-of-band resource load\" issue was discovered on Xiaomi MIWiFi Xiaomi_55DD Version 2.8.50 devices. It is possible to induce the application to retrieve the contents of an arbitrary external URL and return those contents in its own response. If a domain name (containing a random string) is used in the HTTP Host header, the application performs an HTTP request to the specified domain. The response from that request is then included in the application's own response.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16307", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMI\u00bbXiaomi Miwifi Xiaomi 55dd Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.8.50cpe:2.3:o:mi:xiaomi_miwifi_xiaomi_55dd_firmware:2.8.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:MI\u00bbXiaomi Miwifi Xiaomi 55dd\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.59% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.56%  0.59%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.55%  0.56%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-24  0.83%  0.55%  -0.29 \n 4  2024-01-27  0.71%  0.83%  +0.12 \n 5  2023-05-23  0.50%  0.71%  +0.21 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.50%  -0.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/149196/MIWiFi-Xiaomi_55DD-2.8.50-Out-Of-Band-Resource-Load.html", "ref_desc": "MIWiFi Xiaomi_55DD 2.8.50 Out-Of-Band Resource Load \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
