{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14731", "Description": "An issue was discovered in HMRServer.js in Parcel parcel-bundler. Attackers are able to steal developer's code because the origin of requests is not checked by the WebSocket server, which is used for HMR (Hot Module Replacement). Anyone can receive the HMR message sent by the WebSocket server via a ws://127.0.0.1 connection (with a random TCP port number) from any origin. The random port number can be found by connecting to http://127.0.0.1 and reading the \"new WebSocket\" line in the source code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14731", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nParceljs\u00bbParcel\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:parceljs:parcel:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.38%  +0.19 \n 2  2024-07-06  0.27%  0.19%  -0.08 \n 3  2024-05-10  0.29%  0.27%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-09-15  0.33%  0.29%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.28%  0.33%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.28%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/1783", "ref_desc": "A vulnerability found in parcel-bundler \u00b7 Issue #1783 \u00b7 parcel-bundler/parcel \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.cal1.cn/post/Sniffing%20Codes%20in%20Hot%20Module%20Reloading%20Messages", "ref_desc": "Sniffing Codes in Hot Module Reloading Messages - crblogExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qO61M-9ivA8skWjZ93dZveHJ39Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/pull/1794", "ref_desc": "Fix security vulnerability by DeMoorJasper \u00b7 Pull Request #1794 \u00b7 parcel-bundler/parcel \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
