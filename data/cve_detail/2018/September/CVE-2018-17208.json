{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-17208", "Description": "Linksys Velop 1.1.2.187020 devices allow unauthenticated command injection, providing an attacker with full root access, via cgi-bin/zbtest.cgi or cgi-bin/zbtest2.cgi (scripts that can be discovered with binwalk on the firmware, but are not visible in the web interface). This occurs because shell metacharacters in the query string are mishandled by ShellExecute, as demonstrated by the zbtest.cgi?cmd=level&level= substring. This can also be exploited via CSRF.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17208", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nLinksys\u00bbVelop Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.1.2.187020cpe:2.3:o:linksys:velop_firmware:1.1.2.187020:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linksys\u00bbVelop\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "4.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.06%  4.66%  +3.60 \n 2  2024-09-17  1.05%  1.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-07  0.86%  1.05%  +0.19 \n 4  2024-06-07  0.85%  0.86%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-10  0.82%  0.85%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-04-25  0.62%  0.82%  +0.20 \n 7  2024-03-15  0.54%  0.62%  +0.07 \n 8  2024-02-09  1.06%  0.54%  -0.52 \n 9  2023-05-05  1.50%  1.06%  -0.44 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.06%  1.50%  -0.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://langkjaer.com/velop.html", "ref_desc": "Langkjaer Cyber DefenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
