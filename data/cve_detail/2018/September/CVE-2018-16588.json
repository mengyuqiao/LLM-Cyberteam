{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16588", "Description": "Privilege escalation can occur in the SUSE useradd.c code in useradd, as distributed in the SUSE shadow package through 4.2.1-27.9.1 for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 (SLE-12) and through 4.5-5.39 for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 (SLE-15). Non-existing intermediate directories are created with mode 0777 during user creation. Given that they are world-writable, local attackers might use this for privilege escalation and other unspecified attacks.  NOTE: this would affect non-SUSE users who took useradd.c code from a 2014-04-02 upstream pull request; however, no non-SUSE distribution is known to be affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16588", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSuse\u00bbShadowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.5-5.39cpe:2.3:a:suse:shadow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Suse\u00bbLinux Enterprise\u00bbVersion:15.0\nSuse\u00bbShadowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.1-27.9.1cpe:2.3:a:suse:shadow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Suse\u00bbLinux Enterprise\u00bbVersion:12.0", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2018-09/msg00073.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2018:2852-1: moderate: Security update fVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
