{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16703", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Gleez CMS 1.2.0 login page could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform multiple user enumerations, which can further help an attacker to perform login attempts in excess of the configured login attempt limit. The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side access control and login attempt limit enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending modified login attempts to the Portal login page. An exploit could allow the attacker to identify existing users and perform brute-force password attacks on the Portal, as demonstrated by navigating to the user/4 URI.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16703", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGleeztech\u00bbGleez Cms\u00bbVersion:1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:gleeztech:gleez_cms:1.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-17  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-22  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-04-26  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.16%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gleez/cms/issues/802", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated user enumeration and Possible account brute force leading to account compromise \u00b7 Issue #802 \u00b7 gleez/cms \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
