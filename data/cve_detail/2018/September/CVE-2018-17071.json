{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-17071", "Description": "The fallback function of a simple lottery smart contract implementation for Lucky9io, an Ethereum gambling game, generates a random value with the publicly readable variable entry_number. This variable is private, yet it is readable by eth.getStorageAt function. Also, attackers can purchase a ticket at a low price by directly calling the fallback function with small msg.value, because the developer set the currency unit incorrectly. Therefore, it allows attackers to always win and get rewards.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17071", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLucky9\u00bbLucky9io\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:lucky9:lucky9io:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.59%  0.79%  +0.20 \n 2  2023-06-05  0.41%  0.59%  +0.17 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.41%  -0.47 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TEAM-C4B/CVE-LIST/tree/master/CVE-2018-17071", "ref_desc": "CVE-LIST/CVE-2018-17071 at master \u00b7 TEAM-C4B/CVE-LIST \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
