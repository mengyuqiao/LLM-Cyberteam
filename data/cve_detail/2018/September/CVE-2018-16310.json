{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16310", "Description": "Technicolor TG588V V2 devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (networking outage) via a flood of random MAC addresses, as demonstrated by macof. NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2018-15852 and CVE-2018-15907. NOTE: Technicolor denies that the described behavior is a vulnerability and states that Wi-Fi traffic is slowed or stopped only while the devices are exposed to a MAC flooding attack. This has been confirmed through testing against official up-to-date versions", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16310", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nTechnicolor\u00bbTg588v Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:technicolor:tg588v_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Technicolor\u00bbTg588v\u00bbVersion:2", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-16  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-16  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://buddieshub27.blogspot.com/2018/09/cve-2018-16310-technicolor-tg588v-v2.html", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-16310- Technicolor TG588V V2 - Buffer OverflowExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
