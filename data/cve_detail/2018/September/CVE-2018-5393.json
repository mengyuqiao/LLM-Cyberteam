{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5393", "Description": "The TP-LINK EAP Controller is TP-LINK's software for remotely controlling wireless access point devices. It utilizes a Java remote method invocation (RMI) service for remote control. The RMI interface does not require any authentication before use, so it lacks user authentication for RMI service commands in EAP controller versions 2.5.3 and earlier. Remote attackers can implement deserialization attacks through the RMI protocol. Successful attacks may allow a remote attacker to remotely control the target server and execute Java functions or bytecode.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5393", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTp-link\u00bbEap ControllerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.3cpe:2.3:a:tp-link:eap_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.51%  0.93%  +0.42 \n 2  2024-02-19  0.64%  0.51%  -0.13 \n 3  2023-12-03  0.68%  0.64%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-09-22  0.70%  0.68%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-08-04  0.72%  0.70%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.72%  -0.34 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105402", "ref_desc": "TP-LINK EAP Controller CVE-2018-5393 Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/581311", "ref_desc": "VU#581311 - TP-Link EAP Controller lacks RMI authentication and is vulnerable to deserialization attacksThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Nwwrr4dv5rTIsmGOuWkoaV6IJec.html"}]}
