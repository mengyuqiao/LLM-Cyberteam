{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-13807", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE X300 (All versions < V4.0.0), SCALANCE X408 (All versions < V4.0.0), SCALANCE X414 (All versions). The web interface on port 443/tcp could allow an attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition by sending specially crafted packets to the web server. The device will automatically reboot, impacting network availability for other devices. An attacker must have network access to port 443/tcp to exploit the vulnerability. Neither valid credentials nor interaction by a legitimate user is required to exploit the vulnerability. There is no confidentiality or integrity impact, only availability is temporarily impacted. This vulnerability could be triggered by publicly available tools.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13807", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbScalance X300 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:o:siemens:scalance_x300_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbScalance X300\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSiemens\u00bbScalance X408 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:o:siemens:scalance_x408_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbScalance X408\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSiemens\u00bbScalance X414 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:siemens:scalance_x414_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbScalance X414\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.24%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-06-26  0.40%  0.30%  -0.10 \n 3  2024-04-30  0.64%  0.40%  -0.24 \n 4  2024-03-13  0.59%  0.64%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-02-03  0.78%  0.59%  -0.19 \n 6  2023-10-11  0.77%  0.78%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-09-06  0.67%  0.77%  +0.10 \n 8  2023-07-19  0.72%  0.67%  -0.04 \n 9  2023-07-08  0.51%  0.72%  +0.21 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.51%  -0.45 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-254-05", "ref_desc": "Siemens SCALANCE X Switches | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105331", "ref_desc": "Multiple Siemens SCALANCE X Switches CVE-2018-13807 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-447396.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
