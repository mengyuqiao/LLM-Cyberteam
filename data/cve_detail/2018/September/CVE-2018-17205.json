{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-17205", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open vSwitch (OvS) 2.7.x through 2.7.6, affecting ofproto_rule_insert__ in ofproto/ofproto.c. During bundle commit, flows that are added in a bundle are applied to ofproto in order. If a flow cannot be added (e.g., the flow action is a go-to for a group id that does not exist), OvS tries to revert back all previous flows that were successfully applied from the same bundle. This is possible since OvS maintains list of old flows that were replaced by flows from the bundle. While reinserting old flows, OvS has an assertion failure due to a check on rule state != RULE_INITIALIZED. This would work for new flows, but for an old flow the rule state is RULE_REMOVED. The assertion failure causes an OvS crash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17205", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenstack\u00bbVersion:10cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openstack:10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbOpenstack\u00bbVersion:13cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openstack:13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:16.04    LTSEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:16.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:18.04    LTSEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:18.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenvswitch\u00bbOpenvswitchVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.7.6cpe:2.3:a:openvswitch:openvswitch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.54%  +0.20 \n 2  2024-07-04  0.47%  0.33%  -0.14 \n 3  2024-05-08  0.45%  0.47%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-02-10  0.49%  0.45%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-09-13  0.42%  0.49%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.38%  0.42%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.38%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/0befd1f3745055c32940f5faf9559be6a14395e6", "ref_desc": "ofproto: Fix OVS crash when reverting old flows in bundle commit \u00b7 openvswitch/ovs@0befd1f \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0053", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:0053 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/shi9T7qGXqR01IGe5jrooCK_JI8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0081", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:0081 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vKjeyj5AUJcE7TfWQdFtnshoh3E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3500", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:3500 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WSJAvqXf-Omfi6tUz9LCATuFsNM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3873-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-3873-1: Open vSwitch vulnerabilities | Ubuntu security noticesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Zwv9eQpCq9z4KN5E7GciTfuPLNs.html"}]}
