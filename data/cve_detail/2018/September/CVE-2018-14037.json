{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14037", "Description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Progress Kendo UI Editor v2018.1.221 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the DOM of the WYSIWYG editor because of the editorNS.Serializer toEditableHtml function in kendo.all.min.js. If the victim accesses the editor, the payload gets executed. Furthermore, if the payload is reflected at any other resource that does rely on the sanitisation of the editor itself, the JavaScript payload will be executed in the context of the application. This allows attackers (in the worst case) to take over user sessions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14037", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nProgress\u00bbKendo Ui\u00bbVersion:2018.1.221cpe:2.3:a:progress:kendo_ui:2018.1.221:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.36%  +0.18 \n 2  2023-09-21  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.17%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Sep/50", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Re: SEC Consult SA-20180926-0 :: Stored Cross-Site Scripting in Progress Kendo UI EditorMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/stored-cross-site-scripting-in-kendo-ui-editor-cve-2018-14037/", "ref_desc": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting in Kendo UI Editor (CVE-2018-14037) \u2013 SEC ConsultExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Sep/49", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: SEC Consult SA-20180926-0 ::Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
