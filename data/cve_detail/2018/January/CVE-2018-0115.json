{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0115", "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of the Cisco StarOS operating system for Cisco ASR 5000 Series routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on an affected host operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious command arguments into a vulnerable CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to authenticate to the affected system by using valid administrator credentials.
