{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1000005", "Description": "libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000005", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:14.04    LTSEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:14.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:16.04    LTSEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:16.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:17.10cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:17.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHaxx\u00bbLibcurlVersions  from including (>=) 7.49.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.57.0cpe:2.3:a:haxx:libcurl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.65%  0.47%  -0.18 \n 2  2024-01-04  0.66%  0.65%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-08-20  0.72%  0.66%  -0.06 \n 4  2023-07-27  0.88%  0.72%  -0.16 \n 5  2023-06-17  1.45%  0.88%  -0.58 \n 6  2023-05-08  1.11%  1.45%  +0.35 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040273", "ref_desc": "cURL HTTP/2 Trailer Processor Out-of-Bound Memory Read Error Lets Remote Users Deny Service or Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-824a.html", "ref_desc": "curl - HTTP/2 trailer out-of-bounds read - CVE-2018-1000005Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4098", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4098-1 curlThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q7g2yfnefVckXW5S5MNjP8hfulw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231", "ref_desc": "http2.c: fix incorrect trailer buffer size by ZhouyihaiDing \u00b7 Pull Request #2231 \u00b7 curl/curl \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1543", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:1543 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sVb2Yl5qL-N7rKP_ypdM9lF_2pQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3554-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-3554-1: curl vulnerabilities | Ubuntu security noticesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xQUU6teYgz7eVssdpXCkyXZob20.html"}]}
