{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000479", "Description": "pfSense versions 2.4.1 and lower are vulnerable to clickjacking attacks in the CSRF error page resulting in privileged execution of arbitrary code, because the error detection occurs before an X-Frame-Options header is set. This is fixed in 2.4.2-RELEASE. OPNsense, a 2015 fork of pfSense, was not vulnerable since version 16.1.16 released on June 06, 2016. The unprotected web form was removed from the code during an internal security audit under \"possibly insecure\" suspicions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000479", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNetgate\u00bbPfsenseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.4.1cpe:2.3:a:netgate:pfsense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpnsense Project\u00bbOpnsenseVersions  before (<) 16.1.16cpe:2.3:a:opnsense_project:opnsense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.59% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.15%  2.59%  +1.44 \n 2  2023-12-14  1.16%  1.15%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-11-13  1.17%  1.16%  0.00 \n 4  2023-05-27  1.33%  1.17%  -0.16 \n 5  2023-05-08  2.07%  1.33%  -0.75 \n 6  2023-03-07  40.93%  2.07%  -38.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense/commit/386d89b07", "ref_desc": "Prevent Clickjacking in CSRF error page \u00b7 pfsense/pfsense@386d89b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opnsense/core/commit/d218b225", "ref_desc": "csrf: tighten csrf code paths a little \u00b7 opnsense/core@d218b22 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.netgate.com/blog/pfsense-2-4-2-release-p1-and-2-3-5-release-p1-now-available.html", "ref_desc": "pfSense 2.4.2-RELEASE-p1 and 2.3.5-RELEASE-p1 now availableThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.securify.nl/en/advisory/SFY20171101/clickjacking-vulnerability-in-csrf-error-page-pfsense.html", "ref_desc": "Clickjacking vulnerability in CSRF error page pfSense - Security Advisories and Insights - Securify B.V.Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/2.4.2_New_Features_and_Changes", "ref_desc": "Releases \u2014 2.4.2 New Features and Changes | pfSense DocumentationIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/11/22/7", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Clickjacking vulnerability in CSRF error page pfSenseExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
