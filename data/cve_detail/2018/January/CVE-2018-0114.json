{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0114", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before 0.11.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign tokens using a key that is embedded within the token. The vulnerability is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key (JWK) representing a public key can be embedded within the header of a JWS. This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker could exploit this by forging valid JWS objects by removing the original signature, adding a new public key to the header, and then signing the object using the (attacker-owned) private key associated with the public key embedded in that JWS header.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0114", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbNode-joseVersions  before (<) 0.11.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:node-jose:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.94% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.44%  3.94%  +1.51 \n 2  2023-05-28  3.74%  2.44%  -1.30 \n 3  2023-04-15  2.86%  3.74%  +0.88 \n 4  2023-03-07  18.53%  2.86%  -15.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=56326", "ref_desc": "Node-jose Library JSON Web Tokens Re-sign VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zi0Black/POC-CVE-2018-0114", "ref_desc": "GitHub - zi0Black/POC-CVE-2018-0114: This repository contains the POC of an exploit for node-jose < 0.11.0Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102445", "ref_desc": "Cisco Node-jose Library CVE-2018-0114 Remote Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44324/", "ref_desc": "Cisco node-jos < 0.11.0 - Re-sign TokensThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md", "ref_desc": "node-jose/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 cisco/node-jose \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
