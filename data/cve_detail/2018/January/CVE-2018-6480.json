{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6480", "Description": "A type confusion issue was discovered in CCN-lite 2, leading to a memory access violation and a failure of the nonce feature (which, for example, helped with loop prevention). ccnl_fwd_handleInterest assumes that the union member s is of type ccnl_pktdetail_ndntlv_s. However, if the type is in fact struct ccnl_pktdetail_ccntlv_s or struct ccnl_pktdetail_iottlv_s, the memory at that point is either uninitialised or points to data that is not a nonce, which renders the code using the local variable nonce pointless. A later nonce check is insufficient.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6480", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCcn-lite\u00bbCcn-lite\u00bbVersion:2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:ccn-lite:ccn-lite:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.24%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.20%  0.20%  0.00 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.20%  0.20%  0.00 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-15  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-02-09  0.20%  0.17%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-05-08  0.14%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-704 Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/704/Incorrect-Type-Conversion-or-Cast.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite/issues/159", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2018-6480] - type confusion in ccnl_fwd_handleInterest \u00b7 Issue #159 \u00b7 cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
