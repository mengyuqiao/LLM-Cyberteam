{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6000", "Description": "An issue was discovered in AsusWRT before 3.0.0.4.384_10007. The do_vpnupload_post function in router/httpd/web.c in vpnupload.cgi provides functionality for setting NVRAM configuration values, which allows attackers to set the admin password and launch an SSH daemon (or enable infosvr command mode), and consequently obtain remote administrative access, via a crafted request. This is available to unauthenticated attackers in conjunction with CVE-2018-5999.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6000", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAsus\u00bbAsuswrtVersions  before (<) 3.0.0.4.384_10007cpe:2.3:o:asus:asuswrt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  9.00%  7.41%  -1.59 \n 2  2023-08-18  21.37%  9.00%  -12.37 \n 3  2023-07-06  27.43%  21.37%  -6.06 \n 4  2023-06-15  39.30%  27.43%  -11.87 \n 5  2023-05-24  61.99%  39.30%  -22.69 \n 6  2023-05-03  68.42%  61.99%  -6.44 \n 7  2023-03-11  74.13%  68.42%  -5.71 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  74.13%  +73.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44176/", "ref_desc": "AsusWRT LAN - Remote Code Execution (Metasploit)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/b4JvC497613KS0GysywWYxz1COM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/exploits/metasploit/asuswrt_lan_rce.rb", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Hr7ZD57FCH81UVxxNHBy_fx28jw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3589", "ref_desc": "SSD Advisory \u2013 Hack2Win - Asus Unauthenticated LAN Remote Command Execution - SSD Secure DisclosureExploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jayrK2uvNvOsMdbXtXaqIbBbvsY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/asuswrt-lan-rce.txt", "ref_desc": "PoC/asuswrt-lan-rce.txt at master \u00b7 pedrib/PoC \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qR-0OVVT4OyVZ_1kn95b0m7Zq0o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43881/", "ref_desc": "AsusWRT Router < 3.0.0.4.380.7743 - LAN Remote Code ExecutionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wnv1jehtQxF8mppdviLwZeSEK1I.html"}]}
