{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000505", "Description": "In Jenkins Script Security Plugin version 1.36 and earlier, users with the ability to configure sandboxed Groovy scripts are able to use a type coercion feature in Groovy to create new `File` objects from strings. This allowed reading arbitrary files on the Jenkins master file system. Such a type coercion is now subject to sandbox protection and considered to be a call to the `new File(String)` constructor for the purpose of in-process script approval.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000505", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbScript Security\u00bbForJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.36cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:script_security:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-03-15  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-12-11/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-12-11Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
