{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17662", "Description": "Directory traversal in the HTTP server on Yawcam 0.2.6 through 0.6.0 devices allows attackers to read arbitrary files through a sequence of the form '.x./' or '....\\x/' where x is a pattern composed of one or more (zero or more for the second pattern) of either \\ or ..\\ -- for example a '.\\./', '....\\/' or '...\\./' sequence. For files with no extension, a single dot needs to be appended to ensure the HTTP server does not alter the request, e.g., a \"GET /.\\./.\\./.\\./.\\./.\\./.\\./.\\./windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts.\" request.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17662", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nYawcam\u00bbYawcamVersions  from including (>=) 0.2.6andup to, including, (<=) 0.6.0cpe:2.3:a:yawcam:yawcam:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.41%  0.54%  +0.13 \n 2  2023-12-21  0.58%  0.41%  -0.17 \n 3  2023-06-03  0.69%  0.58%  -0.11 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.76%  0.69%  -0.07 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.76%  -0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/145770/Yawcam-0.6.0-Directory-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Yawcam 0.6.0 Directory Traversal \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.yawcam.com/news.php", "ref_desc": "Yawcam - NewsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
