{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000400", "Description": "The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier remote API at /job/(job-name)/api contained information about upstream and downstream projects. This included information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API now only lists upstream and downstream projects that the current user has access to.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000400", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.73.1cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.83cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-10-11/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-10-11Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7NyxuPanI0E2DvN3-8nGdwr64Kw.html"}]}
