{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000401", "Description": "The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier default form control for passwords and other secrets, <f:password/>, supports form validation (e.g. for API keys). The form validation AJAX requests were sent via GET, which could result in secrets being logged to a HTTP access log in non-default configurations of Jenkins, and made available to users with access to these log files. Form validation for <f:password/> is now always sent via POST, which is typically not logged.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000401", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.73.1cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.83cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-10-11/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-10-11Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7NyxuPanI0E2DvN3-8nGdwr64Kw.html"}]}
