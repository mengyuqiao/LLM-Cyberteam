{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6360", "Description": "mpv through 0.28.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web site, because it reads HTML documents containing VIDEO elements, and accepts arbitrary URLs in a src attribute without a protocol whitelist in player/lua/ytdl_hook.lua. For example, an av://lavfi:ladspa=file= URL signifies that the product should call dlopen on a shared object file located at an arbitrary local pathname. The issue exists because the product does not consider that youtube-dl can provide a potentially unsafe URL.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6360", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMPV\u00bbMPVVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.28.0cpe:2.3:a:mpv:mpv:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.60%  1.56%  -1.04 \n 2  2024-01-07  2.64%  2.60%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-12-07  2.57%  2.64%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-07-30  3.59%  2.57%  -1.02 \n 5  2023-06-20  4.21%  3.59%  -0.61 \n 6  2023-05-08  4.92%  4.21%  -0.71 \n 7  2023-03-07  4.24%  4.92%  +0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201805-05", "ref_desc": "mpv: Remote code execution (GLSA 201805-05) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4105", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4105-1 mpvThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/5456", "ref_desc": "Protocol whitelist in ytdl_hook \u00b7 Issue #5456 \u00b7 mpv-player/mpv \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/e6e6b0dcc7e9b0dbf35154a179b3dc1fcfcaff43", "ref_desc": "ytdl_hook: whitelist protocols from urls retrieved from youtube-dl \u00b7 mpv-player/mpv@e6e6b0d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
