{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5709", "Description": "An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. There is a variable \"dbentry->n_key_data\" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a \"u4\" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5709", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nMIT\u00bbKerberosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5-1.16cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-26  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772@%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[jira] [Created] (FTPSERVER-500) Security vulnerability in common/lib/log4j-1.2.17.jar - Pony MailCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oN9yHebqh8KRekUU1t5c7OkOPaM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/poojamnit/Kerberos-V5-1.16-Vulnerabilities/tree/master/Integer%20Overflow", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
