{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000398", "Description": "The remote API in Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier at /computer/(agent-name)/api showed information about tasks (typically builds) currently running on that agent. This included information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API now only shows information about accessible tasks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000398", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.73.1cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.83cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-10-11/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-10-11Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7NyxuPanI0E2DvN3-8nGdwr64Kw.html"}]}
