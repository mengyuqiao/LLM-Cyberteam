{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-18044", "Description": "A Command Injection issue was discovered in ContentStore/Base/CVDataPipe.dll in Commvault before v11 SP6. A certain message parsing function inside the Commvault service does not properly validate the input of an incoming string before passing it to CreateProcess. As a result, a specially crafted message can inject commands that will be executed on the target operating system. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require authentication and can lead to SYSTEM level privilege on any system running the cvd daemon. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-3195.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18044", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCommvault\u00bbCommvaultVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.0cpe:2.3:a:commvault:commvault:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCommvault\u00bbCommvault\u00bbVersion:11.0UpdateSP2cpe:2.3:a:commvault:commvault:11.0:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCommvault\u00bbCommvault\u00bbVersion:11.0UpdateSP4cpe:2.3:a:commvault:commvault:11.0:sp4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCommvault\u00bbCommvault\u00bbVersion:11.0UpdateSP1cpe:2.3:a:commvault:commvault:11.0:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCommvault\u00bbCommvault\u00bbVersion:11.0UpdateSP3cpe:2.3:a:commvault:commvault:11.0:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCommvault\u00bbCommvault\u00bbVersion:11.0UpdateSP5cpe:2.3:a:commvault:commvault:11.0:sp5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "86.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  6.43%  86.80%  +80.37 \n 2  2024-08-13  5.47%  6.43%  +0.96 \n 3  2024-08-10  6.43%  5.47%  -0.96 \n 4  2024-02-04  4.64%  6.43%  +1.79 \n 5  2023-06-12  4.25%  4.64%  +0.40 \n 6  2023-05-08  4.66%  4.25%  -0.41 \n 7  2023-03-07  67.20%  4.66%  -62.55 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/9389", "ref_desc": "Update commvault_cmd_exec module documentation by wchen-r7 \u00b7 Pull Request #9389 \u00b7 rapid7/metasploit-framework \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.securifera.com/advisories/sec-2017-0001/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-18044 \u2013 SecuriferaThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/9340", "ref_desc": "Commvault Remote Command Injection by rwincey \u00b7 Pull Request #9340 \u00b7 rapid7/metasploit-framework \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
