{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000354", "Description": "Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to a login command which allowed impersonating any Jenkins user. The `login` command available in the remoting-based CLI stored the encrypted user name of the successfully authenticated user in a cache file used to authenticate further commands. Users with sufficient permission to create secrets in Jenkins, and download their encrypted values (e.g. with Job/Configure permission), were able to impersonate any other Jenkins user on the same instance.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000354", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.46.1cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenkins\u00bbJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.56cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-04-26/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-04-26Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iqw2ukfkoog9a78vwW4KnAP7K_I.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98065", "ref_desc": "Jenkins CVE-2017-1000354 User Impersonation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
