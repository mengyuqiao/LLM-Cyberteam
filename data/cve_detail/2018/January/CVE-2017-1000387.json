{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000387", "Description": "Jenkins Build-Publisher plugin version 1.21 and earlier stores credentials to other Jenkins instances in the file hudson.plugins.build_publisher.BuildPublisher.xml in the Jenkins master home directory. These credentials were stored unencrypted, allowing anyone with local file system access to access them. Additionally, the credentials were also transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000387", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbBuild-publisher\u00bbForJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.21cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:build-publisher:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101544", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Build Publisher Plugin Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-10-23/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-10-23Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KGjJeKATJUByxSZZ2vMlAR1WNg0.html"}]}
