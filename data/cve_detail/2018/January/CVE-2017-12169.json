{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12169", "Description": "It was found that FreeIPA 4.2.0 and later could disclose password hashes to users having the 'System: Read Stage Users' permission. A remote, authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to disclose the password hashes belonging to Stage Users. This security issue does not result in disclosure of password hashes belonging to active standard users. NOTE: some developers feel that this report is a suggestion for a design change to Stage User activation, not a statement of a vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12169", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFreeipa\u00bbFreeipaVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:freeipa:freeipa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.18%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-12-21  0.28%  0.20%  -0.08 \n 3  2023-06-03  0.41%  0.28%  -0.13 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.41%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1487697", "ref_desc": "1487697 \u2013 (CVE-2017-12169) CVE-2017-12169 ipa: Password hash disclosure via 'System: Read Stage Users' permissionIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102136", "ref_desc": "FreeIPA CVE-2017-12169 Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
