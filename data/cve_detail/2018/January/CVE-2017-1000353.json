{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000353", "Description": "Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution. An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the Jenkins CLI, that would be deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism. We're fixing this issue by adding `SignedObject` to the blacklist. We're also backporting the new HTTP CLI protocol from Jenkins 2.54 to LTS 2.46.2, and deprecating the remoting-based (i.e. Java serialization) CLI protocol, disabling it by default.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000353", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOracle\u00bbCommunications Cloud Native Core Automated Test Suite\u00bbVersion:1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:oracle:communications_cloud_native_core_automated_test_suite:1.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.46.1cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenkins\u00bbJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.56cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.37%  97.18%  -0.19 \n 2  2024-12-11  97.20%  97.37%  +0.17 \n 3  2024-10-11  97.26%  97.20%  -0.05 \n 4  2024-08-12  96.61%  97.26%  +0.64 \n 5  2024-08-11  97.26%  96.61%  -0.64 \n 6  2024-07-25  97.04%  97.26%  +0.22 \n 7  2024-05-04  97.12%  97.04%  -0.09 \n 8  2024-03-26  97.27%  97.12%  -0.14 \n 9  2024-01-09  97.33%  97.27%  -0.07 \n 10  2023-12-09  97.28%  97.33%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-11-14  97.24%  97.28%  +0.04 \n 12  2023-09-18  97.28%  97.24%  -0.04 \n 13  2023-07-08  97.35%  97.28%  -0.07 \n 14  2023-06-22  97.33%  97.35%  +0.02 \n 15  2023-05-08  97.28%  97.33%  +0.05 \n 16  2023-03-07  93.10%  97.28%  +4.19 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159266/Jenkins-2.56-CLI-Deserialization-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Jenkins 2.56 CLI Deserialization / Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6asgpQiuGkU8TMiXi_ZmgQDbjR8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41965/", "ref_desc": "CloudBees Jenkins 2.32.1 - Java DeserializationExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-04-26/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-04-26Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iqw2ukfkoog9a78vwW4KnAP7K_I.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98056", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Java Deserialization CVE-2017-1000353 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
