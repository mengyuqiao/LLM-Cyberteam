{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15090", "Description": "An issue has been found in the DNSSEC validation component of PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 and up to and including 4.0.6, where the signatures might have been accepted as valid even if the signed data was not in bailiwick of the DNSKEY used to sign it. This allows an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of records by issuing a valid signature for the crafted records.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15090", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPowerdns\u00bbRecursorVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.0.6cpe:2.3:a:powerdns:recursor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-03  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-16  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.13%  0.08%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2017-03.html", "ref_desc": "PowerDNS Security Advisory 2017-03: Insufficient validation of DNSSEC signatures \u2014 PowerDNS Recursor documentationPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101982", "ref_desc": "PowerDNS Authoritative Server Module Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/t7yaEjkIC7_qbQvvBAN-A6c3vrI.html"}]}
