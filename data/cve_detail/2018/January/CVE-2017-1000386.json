{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000386", "Description": "Jenkins Active Choices plugin version 1.5.3 and earlier allowed users with Job/Configure permission to provide arbitrary HTML to be shown on the 'Build With Parameters' page through the 'Active Choices Reactive Reference Parameter' type. This could include, for example, arbitrary JavaScript. Active Choices now sanitizes the HTML inserted on the 'Build With Parameters' page if and only if the script is executed in a sandbox. As unsandboxed scripts are subject to administrator approval, it is up to the administrator to allow or disallow problematic script output.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000386", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbActive Choices\u00bbForJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.5.2cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:active_choices:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions\nJenkins\u00bbActive Choices\u00bbVersion:1.5.3cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:active_choices:1.5.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenkins\u00bbActive Choices\u00bbVersion:1.5.3UpdateAlphaForJenkinscpe:2.3:a:jenkins:active_choices:1.5.3:alpha:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-05  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101538", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Active Choices Plugin HTML Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-10-23/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-10-23Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KGjJeKATJUByxSZZ2vMlAR1WNg0.html"}]}
