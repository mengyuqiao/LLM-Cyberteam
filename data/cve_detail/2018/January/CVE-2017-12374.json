{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12374", "Description": "The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing operations (mbox.c operations on bounce messages). If successfully exploited, the ClamAV software could allow a variable pointing to the mail body which could cause a used after being free (use-after-free) instance which may lead to a disruption of services on an affected device to include a denial of service condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12374", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nClamav\u00bbClamavVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.99.2cpe:2.3:a:clamav:clamav:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.91%  0.40%  -0.51 \n 2  2023-05-08  1.00%  0.91%  -0.10 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.21%  1.00%  -0.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11939", "ref_desc": "Bug 11939 \u2013 UAF in textIterate (mbox.c)Exploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3550-2/", "ref_desc": "USN-3550-2: ClamAV vulnerabilities | Ubuntu security noticesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cXQdNhzAB2IoHKijB59gQwW54-E.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://blog.clamav.net/2018/01/clamav-0993-has-been-released.html", "ref_desc": "ClamAV\u00ae blog: ClamAV 0.99.3 has been released!Release Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fWoitM-eMY9zO7Yvr9FbRpYnXao.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/01/msg00035.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1261-1] clamav security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HhejE6dH9Q5Mj1OGVrrMv4bkDo0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3550-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-3550-1: ClamAV vulnerabilities | Ubuntu security noticesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pQQJGW_pSsahHFGscRjn3N34Y8s.html"}]}
