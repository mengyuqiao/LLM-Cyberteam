{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16858", "Description": "The 'crowd-application' plugin module (notably used by the Google Apps plugin) in Atlassian Crowd from version 1.5.0 before version 3.1.2 allowed an attacker to impersonate a Crowd user in REST requests by being able to authenticate to a directory bound to an application using the feature. Given the following situation: the Crowd application is bound to directory 1 and has a user called admin and the Google Apps application is bound to directory 2, which also has a user called admin, it was possible to authenticate REST requests using the credentials of the user coming from directory 2 and impersonate the user from directory 1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16858", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAtlassian\u00bbCrowdVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 3.1.2cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:crowd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-5009", "ref_desc": "[CWD-5009] REST endpoint user impersonation using authentication module functionality - CVE-2017-16858 - Create and track feature requests for Atlassian products.Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
