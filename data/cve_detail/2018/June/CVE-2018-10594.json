{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10594", "Description": "Delta Industrial Automation COMMGR from Delta Electronics versions 1.08 and prior with accompanying PLC Simulators (DVPSimulator EH2, EH3, ES2, SE, SS2 and AHSIM_5x0, AHSIM_5x1) utilize a fixed-length stack buffer where an unverified length value can be read from the network packets via a specific network port, causing the buffer to be overwritten. This may allow remote code execution, cause the application to crash, or result in a denial-of-service condition in the application server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10594", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDeltaww\u00bbCommgrVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.08cpe:2.3:a:deltaww:commgr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Deltaww\u00bbDvpsimulator Ahsim 5x0\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Deltaww\u00bbDvpsimulator Ahsim 5x1\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Deltaww\u00bbDvpsimulator Eh2\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Deltaww\u00bbDvpsimulator Es2\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Deltaww\u00bbDvpsimulator H3\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Deltaww\u00bbDvpsimulator Se\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Deltaww\u00bbDvpsimulator Ss2\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "61.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-20  62.24%  61.60%  -0.65 \n 2  2024-12-17  60.83%  62.24%  +1.41 \n 3  2024-07-06  62.30%  60.83%  -1.47 \n 4  2024-05-31  55.24%  62.30%  +7.06 \n 5  2024-04-30  46.41%  55.24%  +8.83 \n 6  2024-04-05  50.35%  46.41%  -3.94 \n 7  2023-12-27  50.84%  50.35%  -0.50 \n 8  2023-11-17  48.94%  50.84%  +1.91 \n 9  2023-10-26  53.89%  48.94%  -4.95 \n 10  2023-10-05  51.02%  53.89%  +2.87 \n 11  2023-09-18  51.52%  51.02%  -0.50 \n 12  2023-08-31  54.93%  51.52%  -3.41 \n 13  2023-07-25  54.71%  54.93%  +0.22 \n 14  2023-07-08  70.78%  54.71%  -16.08 \n 15  2023-06-20  70.75%  70.78%  +0.03 \n 16  2023-05-18  71.74%  70.75%  -0.99 \n 17  2023-05-08  59.79%  71.74%  +11.95 \n 18  2023-03-27  55.51%  59.79%  +4.28 \n 19  2023-03-13  50.20%  55.51%  +5.31 \n 20  2023-03-07  83.38%  50.20%  -33.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-172-01", "ref_desc": "Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation COMMGR | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44965/", "ref_desc": "Delta Industrial Automation COMMGR 1.08 - Stack Buffer Overflow (PoC)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45574/", "ref_desc": "Delta Electronics Delta Industrial Automation COMMGR 1.08 - Stack Buffer Overflow (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104529", "ref_desc": "Delta Industrial Automation COMMGR CVE-2018-10594 Stack Based Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
