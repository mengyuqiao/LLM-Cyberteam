{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7162", "Description": "All versions of Node.js 9.x and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node process which provides an http server supporting TLS server to crash. This can be accomplished by sending duplicate/unexpected messages during the handshake. This vulnerability has been addressed by updating the TLS implementation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7162", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.1cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.11.2cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.37%  0.45%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-01-31  0.39%  0.37%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-12-14  0.48%  0.39%  -0.09 \n 4  2023-11-05  0.69%  0.48%  -0.21 \n 5  2023-07-12  0.97%  0.69%  -0.28 \n 6  2023-06-07  0.84%  0.97%  +0.12 \n 7  2023-04-19  0.90%  0.84%  -0.05 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.90%  -0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104468", "ref_desc": "Node.js CVE-2018-7162 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/june-2018-security-releases/", "ref_desc": "June 2018 Security Releases | Node.jsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UdnXRYoHQ4OphOj0PsijSeak020.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-48", "ref_desc": "Node.js: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202003-48) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yLN7SDlxyyFe4xiOjUvVjZs7eIs.html"}]}
