{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7164", "Description": "Node.js versions 9.7.0 and later and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is MEDIUM. A bug introduced in 9.7.0 increases the memory consumed when reading from the network into JavaScript using the net.Socket object directly as a stream. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service by sending tiny chunks of data in short succession. This vulnerability was restored by reverting to the prior behaviour.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7164", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.1cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodejs\u00bbNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 9.7.0andbefore (<) 9.11.2cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.25%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-01-31  0.29%  0.27%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-12-14  0.27%  0.29%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-11-05  0.39%  0.27%  -0.12 \n 5  2023-07-12  0.40%  0.39%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-06-07  0.35%  0.40%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-04-19  0.37%  0.35%  -0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.37%  -0.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104463", "ref_desc": "Node.js CVE-2018-7164 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/june-2018-security-releases/", "ref_desc": "June 2018 Security Releases | Node.jsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UdnXRYoHQ4OphOj0PsijSeak020.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-48", "ref_desc": "Node.js: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202003-48) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yLN7SDlxyyFe4xiOjUvVjZs7eIs.html"}]}
