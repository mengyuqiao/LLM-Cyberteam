{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12454", "Description": "The _addguess function of a simplelottery smart contract implementation for 1000 Guess, an Ethereum gambling game, generates a random value with publicly readable variables such as the current block information and a private variable (which can be read with a getStorageAt call). Therefore, it allows attackers to always win and get rewards.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12454", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\n1000guess\u00bb1000 Guess\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:1000guess:1000_guess:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-08  0.59%  0.17%  -0.42 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.59%  -0.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/@jonghyk.song/attack-on-pseudo-random-number-generator-prng-used-in-1000-guess-an-ethereum-lottery-game-7b76655f953d", "ref_desc": "Attack on Pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used in 1000 Guess, an Ethereum lottery game (CVE-2018\u201312454)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
