{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16726", "Description": "Beckhoff TwinCAT supports communication over ADS. ADS is a protocol for industrial automation in protected environments. ADS has not been designed to achieve security purposes and therefore does not include any encryption algorithms because of their negative effect on performance and throughput. An attacker can forge arbitrary ADS packets when legitimate ADS traffic is observable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16726", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nBeckhoff\u00bbTwincat\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:beckhoff:twincat:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://download.beckhoff.com/download/Document/product-security/Advisories/advisory-2017-001.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
