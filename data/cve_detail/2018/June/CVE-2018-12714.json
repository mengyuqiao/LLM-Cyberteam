{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12714", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. The filter parsing in kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c could be called with no filter, which is an N=0 case when it expected at least one line to have been read, thus making the N-1 index invalid. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (slab out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted perf_event_open and mmap system calls.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12714", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 4.17andbefore (<) 4.17.4cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.63%  0.39%  -0.24 \n 2  2023-11-15  0.95%  0.63%  -0.32 \n 3  2023-07-23  0.95%  0.95%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.73%  0.95%  +0.21 \n 5  2023-06-18  0.80%  0.73%  -0.06 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.80%  -0.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/81f9c4e4177d31ced6f52a89bb70e93bfb77ca03", "ref_desc": "Merge tag 'trace-v4.18-rc1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/ker\u2026 \u00b7 torvalds/linux@81f9c4e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200019", "ref_desc": "200019 \u2013 BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in predicate_parse kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.cIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lcytxw/bug_repro/tree/master/bug_200019", "ref_desc": "bug_repro/bug_200019 at master \u00b7 lcytxw/bug_repro \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104544", "ref_desc": "Linux Kernel 'kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c' Local Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=81f9c4e4177d31ced6f52a89bb70e93bfb77ca03", "ref_desc": "kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - Linux kernel source treeVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
