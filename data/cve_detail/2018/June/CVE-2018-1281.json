{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1281", "Description": "The clustered setup of Apache MXNet allows users to specify which IP address and port the scheduler will listen on via the DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI and DMLC_PS_ROOT_PORT env variables. In versions older than 1.0.0, however, the MXNet framework will listen on 0.0.0.0 rather than user specified DMLC_PS_ROOT_URI once a scheduler node is initialized. This exposes the instance running MXNet to any attackers reachable via the interface they didn't expect to be listening on. For example: If a user wants to run a clustered setup locally, they may specify to run on 127.0.0.1. But since MXNet will listen on 0.0.0.0, it makes the port accessible on all network interfaces.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1281", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbMxnetVersions  before (<) 1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:mxnet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dmlc/ps-lite/commit/4be817e8b03e7e92517e91f2dfcc50865e91c6ea", "ref_desc": "Avoid listening on all interfaces by default \u00b7 dmlc/ps-lite@4be817e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
