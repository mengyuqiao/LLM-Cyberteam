{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12029", "Description": "A race condition in the nginx module in Phusion Passenger 3.x through 5.x before 5.3.2 allows local escalation of privileges when a non-standard passenger_instance_registry_dir with insufficiently strict permissions is configured. Replacing a file with a symlink after the file was created, but before it was chowned, leads to the target of the link being chowned via the path. Targeting sensitive files such as root's crontab file allows privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12029", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPhusion\u00bbPassengerVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 5.3.2cpe:2.3:a:phusion:passenger:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/06/msg00007.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1399-1] ruby-passenger security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-2Kg8q8hqBSfVEl9CTdAyQTcAwc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.phusion.nl/passenger-5-3-2", "ref_desc": "Passenger 5.3.2: various security fixesMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iUU2l136UjOm6TuLLLnPblUjKAA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201807-02", "ref_desc": "Passenger: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 201807-02) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MWaFoO8wlvRe0mxU-wLxcjBXHuQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/advisories/phusion-passenger-priv-esc", "ref_desc": "Phusion Passenger chown() race privilege escalation (CVE-2018-12029)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
