{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11196", "Description": "Mahara 17.04 before 17.04.8 and 17.10 before 17.10.5 and 18.04 before 18.04.1 can be used as medium to transmit viruses by placing infected files into a Leap2A archive and uploading that to Mahara. In contrast to other ZIP files that are uploaded, ClamAV (when activated) does not check Leap2A archives for viruses, allowing malicious files to be available for download. While files cannot be executed on Mahara itself, Mahara can be used to transfer such files to user computers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11196", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMahara\u00bbMaharaVersions  from including (>=) 17.04.0andbefore (<) 17.04.8cpe:2.3:a:mahara:mahara:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMahara\u00bbMaharaVersions  from including (>=) 17.10.0andbefore (<) 17.10.5cpe:2.3:a:mahara:mahara:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMahara\u00bbMahara\u00bbVersion:18.04.0cpe:2.3:a:mahara:mahara:18.04.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-10  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mahara.org/interaction/forum/topic.php?id=8270", "ref_desc": "Security Announcements - Security issue relating to the upload of a virus-infected file <17.04.8; <17.10.5: <18.04.1 - Mahara ePortfolio SystemVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1770535", "ref_desc": "Bug #1770535 \u201cAble to upload a virus file to Files section\u201d : Bugs : MaharaIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
