{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12356", "Description": "An issue was discovered in password-store.sh in pass in Simple Password Store 1.7.x before 1.7.2. The signature verification routine parses the output of GnuPG with an incomplete regular expression, which allows remote attackers to spoof file signatures on configuration files and extension scripts. Modifying the configuration file allows the attacker to inject additional encryption keys under their control, thereby disclosing passwords to the attacker. Modifying the extension scripts allows the attacker arbitrary code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12356", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSimple Password Store Project\u00bbSimple Password StoreVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.0andbefore (<) 1.7.2cpe:2.3:a:simple_password_store_project:simple_password_store:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "17.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  9.87%  17.60%  +7.73 \n 2  2024-08-10  13.32%  9.87%  -3.46 \n 3  2024-05-25  17.21%  13.32%  -3.89 \n 4  2024-04-24  12.36%  17.21%  +4.86 \n 5  2023-12-15  10.87%  12.36%  +1.49 \n 6  2023-11-05  11.47%  10.87%  -0.60 \n 7  2023-07-08  12.54%  11.47%  -1.07 \n 8  2023-06-08  12.25%  12.54%  +0.29 \n 9  2023-05-08  11.20%  12.25%  +1.05 \n 10  2023-03-07  7.15%  11.20%  +4.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/password-store/2018-June/003308.html", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerability: Faulty GPG Signature CheckingMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/commit/?id=8683403b77f59c56fcb1f05c61ab33b9fd61a30d", "ref_desc": "password-store - Simple password manager using gpg and ordinary unix directories.Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152703/Johnny-You-Are-Fired.html", "ref_desc": "Johnny You Are Fired \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eEhKHtomDfdHQ_jDyaJmitbBuBk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Apr/38", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: OpenPGP and S/MIME signature forgery attacks in multiple email clientsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ihza6Ty5A7RfOZin69HgwOqHQ_I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired", "ref_desc": "GitHub - RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired: Artifacts for the USENIX publication.CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OZ3kSFsz1D0Re3iFt6YutLkfog0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/06/14/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2018-12356 Breaking signature verification in pass (Simple Password Store)Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/04/30/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Spoofing OpenPGP and S/MIME Signatures in Emails (multiple clients)Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/spgPIaNXpER-rCzHMCwRcZth88s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired/blob/master/paper/johnny-fired.pdf", "ref_desc": "Johnny-You-Are-Fired/johnny-fired.pdf at master \u00b7 RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YtqtpjvmZt5P4eqZzKbZf28iXtg.html"}]}
