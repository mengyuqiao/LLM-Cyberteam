{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1121", "Description": "procps-ng, procps is vulnerable to a process hiding through race condition. Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries. This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ng up to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1121", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nProcps Project\u00bbProcpsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.3.15cpe:2.3:a:procps_project:procps:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-05  0.21%  0.18%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-07-12  0.21%  0.21%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.36%  0.21%  -0.15 \n 5  2023-06-07  0.42%  0.36%  -0.06 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.24%  0.42%  +0.17 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.24%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44806/", "ref_desc": "Procps-ng - Multiple VulnerabilitiesExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_gZPxgFMAw02iRRXKDrtUR3IJho.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q2/122", "ref_desc": "oss-sec: Qualys Security Advisory - Procps-ng Audit ReportExploit;Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-Ca8sbBQLVkaE5TaIuUheM7uBQ4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-1121", "ref_desc": "1575473 \u2013 (CVE-2018-1121) CVE-2018-1121 procps-ng, procps: process hiding through race condition enumerating /procIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.qualys.com/2018/05/17/procps-ng-audit-report-advisory.txt", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Jziyh4fSEC6f6ScliZ61mLWqm9I.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104214", "ref_desc": "Procps-ng Procps Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uORVW1R-ROMZvUoZ71zbyeOlwbw.html"}]}
