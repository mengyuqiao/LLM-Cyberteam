{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12088", "Description": "S3QL before 2.27 mishandles checksumming, and consequently allows replay attacks in which an attacker who controls the backend can present old versions of the filesystem metadata database as up-to-date, temporarily inject zero-valued bytes into files, or temporarily hide parts of files. This is related to the checksum_basic_mapping function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12088", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nS3ql Project\u00bbS3qlVersions  before (<) 2.27cpe:2.3:a:s3ql_project:s3ql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.08%  0.16%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.16%  0.07%  -0.09 \n 6  2023-11-08  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-01  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.17%  0.12%  -0.05 \n 9  2023-06-04  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-08  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bitbucket.org/nikratio/s3ql/commits/85aba5c2d5c81453a73a50ed638adaeef0521020", "ref_desc": "Repository deleted \u2014 BitbucketPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/s3ql/4TzCVIMkA4o", "ref_desc": "Google GroepenThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bitbucket.org/nikratio/s3ql/issues/272/t3_verifypy-test_retrieve-sometimes-fails", "ref_desc": "Repository deleted \u2014 BitbucketExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
