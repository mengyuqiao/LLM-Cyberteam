{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10470", "Description": "Little Snitch versions 4.0 to 4.0.6 use the SecStaticCodeCheckValidityWithErrors() function without the kSecCSCheckAllArchitectures flag and therefore do not validate all architectures stored in a fat binary. An attacker can maliciously craft a fat binary containing multiple architectures that may cause a situation where Little Snitch treats the running process as having no code signature at all while erroneously indicating that the binary on disk does have a valid code signature. This could lead to users being confused about whether or not the code signature is valid.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10470", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nObjective Development\u00bbLittle SnitchVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.0.6cpe:2.3:a:objective_development:little_snitch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://obdev.at/cve/2018-10470-8FRWkW4oH8.html", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-10470Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.okta.com/security-blog/2018/06/issues-around-third-party-apple-code-signing-checks/", "ref_desc": "I can be Apple, and so can you | OktaExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IPETDJxn7NJxMHXWfehnMwg8EME.html"}]}
