{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12557", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Zuul 3.x before 3.1.0. If nodes become offline during the build, the no_log attribute of a task is ignored. If the unreachable error occurred in a task used with a loop variable (e.g., with_items), the contents of the loop items would be printed in the console. This could lead to accidentally leaking credentials or secrets.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12557", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nZuul-ci\u00bbZuulVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:zuul-ci:zuul:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-08  0.54%  0.38%  -0.16 \n 2  2023-06-13  0.53%  0.54%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.37%  0.53%  +0.16 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.37%  -0.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002177", "ref_desc": "StoryBoardThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.zuul-ci.org/pipermail/zuul-announce/2018-June/000015.html", "ref_desc": "Unintended variable disclosure on Ansible unreachable tasks despite no_logMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.zuul-ci.org/cgit/zuul/commit/?id=ffe7278c08e6e36bf8b18f732c764e00ff51551e", "ref_desc": "Fix information disclosure caused by unreachable nodes \u00b7 ffe7278c08 - zuul - OpenDev: Free Software Needs Free ToolsPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
