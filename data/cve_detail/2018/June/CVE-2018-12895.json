{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12895", "Description": "WordPress through 4.9.6 allows Author users to execute arbitrary code by leveraging directory traversal in the wp-admin/post.php thumb parameter, which is passed to the PHP unlink function and can delete the wp-config.php file. This is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase the attacker's privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12895", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWordpress\u00bbWordpressVersions  before (<) 4.9.7cpe:2.3:a:wordpress:wordpress:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "42.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  45.74%  42.14%  -3.60 \n 2  2024-07-11  53.46%  45.74%  -7.72 \n 3  2024-06-05  73.37%  53.46%  -19.90 \n 4  2024-05-05  82.32%  73.37%  -8.96 \n 5  2024-01-20  85.57%  82.32%  -3.24 \n 6  2023-12-27  88.13%  85.57%  -2.56 \n 7  2023-11-17  90.94%  88.13%  -2.82 \n 8  2023-10-26  93.44%  90.94%  -2.50 \n 9  2023-07-08  92.88%  93.44%  +0.57 \n 10  2023-05-08  93.44%  92.88%  -0.57 \n 11  2023-03-07  21.65%  93.44%  +71.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4250", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4250-1 wordpressThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/wordpress-file-delete-to-code-execution/", "ref_desc": "WARNING: WordPress File Delete to Code ExecutionThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9100", "ref_desc": "WordPress <= 4.9.6 - Authenticated Arbitrary File DeletionThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/07/msg00046.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1452-1] wordpress security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pjamAONJtx6SXUpFSfLfShYb3Jk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104569", "ref_desc": "WordPress CVE-2018-12895 Directory Traversal VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164633/WordPress-4.9.6-Arbitrary-File-Deletion.html", "ref_desc": "WordPress 4.9.6 Arbitrary File Deletion \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
