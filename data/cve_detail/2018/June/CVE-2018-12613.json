{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12613", "Description": "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2, in which an attacker can include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the \"$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true\" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the \"$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0\" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12613", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPhpmyadmin\u00bbPhpmyadminVersions  from including (>=) 4.8.0andbefore (<) 4.8.2cpe:2.3:a:phpmyadmin:phpmyadmin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.31%  97.32%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-05-31  97.37%  97.31%  -0.06 \n 3  2024-04-30  97.41%  97.37%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-04-05  97.41%  97.41%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-02-08  97.39%  97.41%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-01-15  97.42%  97.39%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-12-22  97.45%  97.42%  -0.02 \n 8  2023-12-03  97.38%  97.45%  +0.07 \n 9  2023-11-12  97.46%  97.38%  -0.08 \n 10  2023-10-21  97.42%  97.46%  +0.04 \n 11  2023-10-01  97.43%  97.42%  -0.01 \n 12  2023-09-13  97.38%  97.43%  +0.04 \n 13  2023-08-26  97.46%  97.38%  -0.08 \n 14  2023-08-08  97.49%  97.46%  -0.03 \n 15  2023-07-20  97.50%  97.49%  -0.01 \n 16  2023-07-08  97.51%  97.50%  -0.01 \n 17  2023-06-15  97.52%  97.52%  -0.01 \n 18  2023-05-31  97.52%  97.52%  +0.00 \n 19  2023-05-13  97.52%  97.52%  +0.00 \n 20  2023-04-11  97.50%  97.52%  +0.01 \n 21  2023-03-08  97.51%  97.50%  -0.01 \n 22  2023-03-07  88.92%  97.51%  +8.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44928/", "ref_desc": "phpMyAdmin 4.8.1 - (Authenticated) Local File Inclusion (2)Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164623/phpMyAdmin-4.8.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "phpMyAdmin 4.8.1 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2018-4/", "ref_desc": "phpMyAdmin - Security - PMASA-2018-4Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44924/", "ref_desc": "phpMyAdmin 4.8.1 - (Authenticated) Local File Inclusion (1)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201904-16", "ref_desc": "phpMyAdmin: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201904-16) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fJyUpqf6evgrBVKCBKjWy6lVjn8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45020/", "ref_desc": "phpMyAdmin - (Authenticated) Remote Code Execution (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104532", "ref_desc": "phpMyAdmin CVE-2018-12613 Remote File Inclusion VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
