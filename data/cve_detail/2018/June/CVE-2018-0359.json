{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0359", "Description": "A vulnerability in the session identification management functionality of the web-based management interface for Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to hijack a valid user session identifier, aka Session Fixation. The vulnerability exists because the affected application does not assign a new session identifier to a user session when a user authenticates to the application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a hijacked session identifier to connect to the application through the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user's browser session.
