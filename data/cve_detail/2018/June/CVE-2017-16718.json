{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16718", "Description": "Beckhoff TwinCAT 3 supports communication over ADS. ADS is a protocol for industrial automation in protected environments. This protocol uses user configured routes, that can be edited remotely via ADS. This special command supports encrypted authentication with username/password. The encryption uses a fixed key, that could be extracted by an attacker. Precondition of the exploitation of this weakness is network access at the moment a route is added.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16718", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBeckhoff\u00bbTwincat\u00bbVersion:3.0cpe:2.3:a:beckhoff:twincat:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://download.beckhoff.com/download/Document/product-security/Advisories/advisory-2017-002.pdf", "ref_desc": "Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
