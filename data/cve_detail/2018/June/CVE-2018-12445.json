{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12445", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the com.dropbox.android application 98.2.2 for Android. The FingerprintManager class for Biometric validation allows authentication bypass through the callback method from onAuthenticationFailed to onAuthenticationSucceeded with null, because the fingerprint API in conjunction with the Android keyGenerator class is not implemented. In other words, an attacker could authenticate with an arbitrary fingerprint. NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes Android devices on which rooting has occurred", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12445", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDropbox\u00bbDropbox\u00bbVersion:98.2.2ForAndroidcpe:2.3:a:dropbox:dropbox:98.2.2:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-29  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/tanprathan/0b63b1868307c732190c2ad3bd1791c7", "ref_desc": "Dropbox CVE-2018-12445 Information \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
