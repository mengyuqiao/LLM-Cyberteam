{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10189", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Mautic 1.x and 2.x before 2.13.0. It is possible to systematically emulate tracking cookies per contact due to tracking the contact by their auto-incremented ID. Thus, a third party can manipulate the cookie value with +1 to systematically assume being tracked as each contact in Mautic. It is then possible to retrieve information about the contact through forms that have progressive profiling enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10189", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMautic\u00bbMauticVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.13.0cpe:2.3:a:mautic:mautic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMautic\u00bbMauticVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.4.1cpe:2.3:a:mautic:mautic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases/tag/2.13.0", "ref_desc": "Release 2.13.0 \u00b7 mautic/mautic \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CBf0sqqLmuj9SiDQDdd2v5zqtOc.html"}]}
