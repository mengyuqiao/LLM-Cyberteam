{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1217", "Description": "Avamar Installation Manager in Dell EMC Avamar Server 7.3.1, 7.4.1, and 7.5.0, and Dell EMC Integrated Data Protection Appliance 2.0 and 2.1, is affected by a missing access control check vulnerability which could potentially allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to read or change the Local Download Service (LDLS) credentials. The LDLS credentials are used to connect to Dell EMC Online Support. If the LDLS configuration was changed to an invalid configuration, then Avamar Installation Manager may not be able to connect to Dell EMC Online Support web site successfully. The remote unauthenticated attacker can also read and use the credentials to login to Dell EMC Online Support, impersonating the AVI service actions using those credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1217", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbEmc Avamar\u00bbVersion:7.4.1cpe:2.3:a:dell:emc_avamar:7.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDell\u00bbEmc Avamar\u00bbVersion:7.3.1cpe:2.3:a:dell:emc_avamar:7.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDell\u00bbEmc Avamar\u00bbVersion:7.5.0cpe:2.3:a:dell:emc_avamar:7.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDell\u00bbEmc Integrated Data Protection Appliance\u00bbVersion:2.0cpe:2.3:a:dell:emc_integrated_data_protection_appliance:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDell\u00bbEmc Integrated Data Protection Appliance\u00bbVersion:2.1cpe:2.3:a:dell:emc_integrated_data_protection_appliance:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "38.69% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  79.38%  38.69%  -40.69 \n 2  2023-08-31  84.35%  79.38%  -4.97 \n 3  2023-08-09  82.99%  84.35%  +1.36 \n 4  2023-07-19  86.14%  82.99%  -3.15 \n 5  2023-07-08  86.47%  86.14%  -0.33 \n 6  2023-07-02  86.98%  86.47%  -0.51 \n 7  2023-06-14  87.96%  86.98%  -0.98 \n 8  2023-05-08  89.47%  87.96%  -1.51 \n 9  2023-04-21  94.20%  89.47%  -4.72 \n 10  2023-04-03  94.29%  94.20%  -0.09 \n 11  2023-03-19  94.96%  94.29%  -0.67 \n 12  2023-03-07  8.38%  94.96%  +86.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Apr/14", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: DSA-2018-025: Dell EMC Avamar and Integrated Data Protection Appliance Installation Manager Missing Access Control VulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44441/", "ref_desc": "Dell EMC Avamar and Integrated Data Protection Appliance Installation Manager - Invalid Access ControlExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040641", "ref_desc": "Dell EMC Avamar Access Control Flaw in Installation Manager Lets Remote Users View and Modify the LDLS Credentials - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
