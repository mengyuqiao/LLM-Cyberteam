{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-9156", "Description": "An issue was discovered on AXIS P1354 (IP camera) Firmware version 5.90.1.1 devices. The upload web page doesn't verify the file type, and an attacker can upload a webshell by making a fileUpload.shtml request for a custom .shtml file, which is interpreted by the Apache HTTP Server mod_include module with \"<!--#exec cmd=\" support. The file needs to include a specific string to meet the internal system architecture. After the webshell upload, an attacker can use the webshell to perform remote code execution such as running a system command (ls, ping, cat /etc/passwd, etc.). NOTE: the vendor reportedly indicates that this is an intended feature or functionality", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9156", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAxis\u00bbP1354 Firmware\u00bbVersion:5.90.1.1cpe:2.3:o:axis:p1354_firmware:5.90.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Axis\u00bbP1354\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "2.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.41%  2.49%  +2.08 \n 2  2024-11-02  0.34%  0.41%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-07-05  0.33%  0.34%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-02-09  0.33%  0.33%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.38%  0.33%  -1.06 \n 6  2023-02-25  1.27%  1.38%  +0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.slideshare.net/secret/aewA1dZwZ9FQ8g", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-9156Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
