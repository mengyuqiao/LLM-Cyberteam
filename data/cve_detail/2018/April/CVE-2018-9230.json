{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-9230", "Description": "In OpenResty through 1.13.6.1, URI parameters are obtained using the ngx.req.get_uri_args and ngx.req.get_post_args functions that ignore parameters beyond the hundredth one, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions or interfere with certain Web Application Firewall (ngx_lua_waf or X-WAF) products. NOTE: the vendor has reported that 100 parameters is an intentional default setting, but is adjustable within the API. The vendor's position is that a security-relevant misuse of the API by a WAF product is a vulnerability in the WAF product, not a vulnerability in OpenResty", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9230", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenresty\u00bbOpenrestyVersions  before (<) 1.13.6.1cpe:2.3:a:openresty:openresty:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.64%  1.62%  +0.98 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.64%  -0.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://openresty.org/en/changelog-1013006.html", "ref_desc": "OpenResty - ChangeLog 1.13.6Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Bypass007/vuln/blob/master/OpenResty/Uri%20parameter%20overflow%20in%20Openresty.md", "ref_desc": "vuln/Uri parameter overflow in Openresty.md at master \u00b7 Bypass007/vuln \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
