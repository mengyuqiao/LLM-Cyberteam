{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-9846", "Description": "In Roundcube from versions 1.2.0 to 1.3.5, with the archive plugin enabled and configured, it's possible to exploit the unsanitized, user-controlled \"_uid\" parameter (in an archive.php _task=mail&_mbox=INBOX&_action=plugin.move2archive request) to perform an MX (IMAP) injection attack by placing an IMAP command after a %0d%0a sequence. NOTE: this is less easily exploitable in 1.3.4 and later because of a Same Origin Policy protection mechanism.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9846", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRoundcube\u00bbWebmailVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.3.5cpe:2.3:a:roundcube:webmail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "40.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-25  48.55%  40.80%  -7.75 \n 2  2023-11-08  67.99%  48.55%  -19.44 \n 3  2023-10-08  73.74%  67.99%  -5.75 \n 4  2023-08-29  76.15%  73.74%  -2.41 \n 5  2023-04-01  78.49%  76.15%  -2.34 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  78.49%  +77.47 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/6238", "ref_desc": "check_request() bypass in archive plugin \u00b7 Issue #6238 \u00b7 roundcube/roundcubemail \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4181", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4181-1 roundcubeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://medium.com/@ndrbasi/cve-2018-9846-roundcube-303097048b0a", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018\u20139846: Roundcube 1.2.0\u20131.3.5 mx injection - Andrea Basile - MediumExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/6229", "ref_desc": "MX injection and type juggling vulnerabilities \u00b7 Issue #6229 \u00b7 roundcube/roundcubemail \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
