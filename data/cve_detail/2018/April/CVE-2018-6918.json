{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6918", "Description": "In FreeBSD before 11.1-STABLE, 11.1-RELEASE-p9, 10.4-STABLE, 10.4-RELEASE-p8 and 10.3-RELEASE-p28, the length field of the ipsec option header does not count the size of the option header itself, causing an infinite loop when the length is zero. This issue can allow a remote attacker who is able to send an arbitrary packet to cause the machine to crash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6918", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFreebsd\u00bbFreebsdVersions  from including (>=) 11.0andbefore (<) 11.1cpe:2.3:o:freebsd:freebsd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFreebsd\u00bbFreebsdVersions  from including (>=) 10.0andbefore (<) 10.4cpe:2.3:o:freebsd:freebsd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.92%  0.97%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-07-08  1.30%  0.92%  -0.38 \n 3  2023-10-05  1.35%  1.30%  -0.05 \n 4  2023-08-26  1.92%  1.35%  -0.57 \n 5  2023-03-29  2.10%  1.92%  -0.18 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.32%  2.10%  +0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103666", "ref_desc": "FreeBSD CVE-2018-6918 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-18:05.ipsec.asc", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210091", "ref_desc": "About the security content of AirPort Base Station Firmware Update 7.8.1 - Apple Support", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/May/77", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: APPLE-SA-2019-5-30-1 AirPort Base Station Firmware Update 7.9.1", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210090", "ref_desc": "About the security content of AirPort Base Station Firmware Update 7.9.1 - Apple Support", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040628", "ref_desc": "FreeBSD IPsec AH Option Header Infinite Loop Lets Remote Users Cause the Target System to Crash - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jun/6", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: APPLE-SA-2019-5-30-1 AirPort Base Station Firmware Update 7.9.1", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
