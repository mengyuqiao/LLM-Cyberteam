{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10361", "Description": "An issue was discovered in KTextEditor 5.34.0 through 5.45.0. Insecure handling of temporary files in the KTextEditor's kauth_ktexteditor_helper service (as utilized in the Kate text editor) can allow other unprivileged users on the local system to gain root privileges. The attack occurs when one user (who has an unprivileged account but is also able to authenticate as root) writes a text file using Kate into a directory owned by a another unprivileged user. The latter unprivileged user conducts a symlink attack to achieve privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10361", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nKDE\u00bbKtexteditorVersions  from including (>=) 5.34.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.45.0cpe:2.3:a:kde:ktexteditor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-19  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/04/24/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - ktexteditor / Kate local privilege escalationMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1033055", "ref_desc": "Bug 1033055 \u2013 AUDIT-0: CVE-2018-10361: ktexteditor: new DBus serviceIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/07/09/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Privileged File Access from Desktop ApplicationsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QjojFBDl5jZZIuJGOCyYtcF7-dI.html"}]}
