{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10204", "Description": "PureVPN 6.0.1 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability in its \"sevpnclient\" service. When configured to use the OpenVPN protocol, the \"sevpnclient\" service executes \"openvpn.exe\" using the OpenVPN config file located at %PROGRAMDATA%\\purevpn\\config\\config.ovpn. This file allows \"Write\" permissions to users in the \"Everyone\" group. An authenticated attacker may modify this file to specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10204", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPurevpn\u00bbPurevpn\u00bbVersion:6.0.1ForWindowscpe:2.3:a:purevpn:purevpn:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-03-15  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-09  0.12%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.19%  0.12%  -1.07 \n 5  2023-01-13  1.09%  1.19%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/VerSprite/research/blob/master/advisories/VS-2018-021.md", "ref_desc": "research/VS-2018-021.md at master \u00b7 VerSprite/research \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
