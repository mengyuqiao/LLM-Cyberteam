{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-9860", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Botan 1.11.32 through 2.x before 2.6.0. An off-by-one error when processing malformed TLS-CBC ciphertext could cause the receiving side to include in the HMAC computation exactly 64K bytes of data following the record buffer, aka an over-read. The MAC comparison will subsequently fail and the connection will be closed. This could be used for denial of service. No information leak occurs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9860", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nBotan Project\u00bbBotanVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.32andbefore (<) 2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:botan_project:botan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-20  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-193 Off-by-one Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/193/Off-by-one-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=7434", "ref_desc": "7434 - botan/tls_client: Heap-buffer-overflow in void Botan::copy_mem<unsigned char> - oss-fuzz - MonorailIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://botan.randombit.net/security.html", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories \u2014 BotanVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SRSV0Vrz5tEApabug-uowSQP0d8.html"}]}
