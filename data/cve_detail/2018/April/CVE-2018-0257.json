{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0257", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software running on Cisco cBR Series Converged Broadband Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause high CPU usage on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain DHCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain DHCP packets to a specific segment of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU usage on the affected device and cause a DoS condition.
