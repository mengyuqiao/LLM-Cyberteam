{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-9127", "Description": "Botan 2.2.0 - 2.4.0 (fixed in 2.5.0) improperly handled wildcard certificates and could accept certain certificates as valid for hostnames when, under RFC 6125 rules, they should not match. This only affects certificates issued to the same domain as the host, so to impersonate a host one must already have a wildcard certificate matching other hosts in the same domain. For example, b*.example.com would match some hostnames that do not begin with a 'b' character.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9127", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBotan Project\u00bbBotanVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:botan_project:botan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-13  0.15%  0.15%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://botan.randombit.net/security.html", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories \u2014 BotanThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SRSV0Vrz5tEApabug-uowSQP0d8.html"}]}
