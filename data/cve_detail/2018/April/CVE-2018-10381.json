{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10381", "Description": "TunnelBear 3.2.0.6 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability through the \"TunnelBearMaintenance\" service. This service establishes a NetNamedPipe endpoint that allows arbitrary installed applications to connect and call publicly exposed methods. The \"OpenVPNConnect\" method accepts a server list argument that provides attacker control of the OpenVPN command line. An attacker can specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10381", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMcafee\u00bbTunnelbear\u00bbVersion:3.2.0.6ForWindowscpe:2.3:a:mcafee:tunnelbear:3.2.0.6:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.49%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-11-27  0.36%  0.39%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.26%  0.36%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.28%  0.26%  -0.02 \n 5  2024-03-15  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-02-09  0.36%  0.25%  -0.11 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.19%  0.36%  -0.83 \n 8  2023-01-20  1.09%  1.19%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/VerSprite/research/blob/master/advisories/VS-2018-022.md", "ref_desc": "research/VS-2018-022.md at master \u00b7 VerSprite/research \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
