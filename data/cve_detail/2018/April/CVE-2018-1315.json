{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1315", "Description": "In Apache Hive 2.1.0 to 2.3.2, when 'COPY FROM FTP' statement is run using HPL/SQL extension to Hive, a compromised/malicious FTP server can cause the file to be written to an arbitrary location on the cluster where the command is run from. This is because FTP client code in HPL/SQL does not verify the destination location of the downloaded file. This does not affect hive cli user and hiveserver2 user as hplsql is a separate command line script and needs to be invoked differently.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1315", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbHiveVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.3.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:hive:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-16  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-02-12  0.14%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.07%  0.14%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d5da94ef60312c01a8d2348466680d1b5fb70702c71a3e84e94f7933@%3Cdev.hive.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] CVE-2018-1315 'COPY FROM FTP' statement in HPL/SQL can write to arbitrary location if the FTP server is compromised - Pony MailMitigation;Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
