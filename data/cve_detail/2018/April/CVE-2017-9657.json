{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9657", "Description": "Under specific 802.11 network conditions, a partial re-association of the Philips IntelliVue MX40 Version B.06.18 WLAN monitor to the central monitoring station is possible. In this state, the central monitoring station can indicate the MX40 is not connected or associated to the central monitor, and thus should be operating in local monitoring mode (local audio-on, screen-on), but the MX40 WLAN itself can instead still be operating in telemetry mode (local audio-off, screen-off). If a patient experiences an alarm event and clinical staff expects the MX40 to provide local alarming when it is not available from the local device, a delay of treatment can occur. CVSS v3 base score: 6.5, CVSS vector string: AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Philips has released software update, Version B.06.18, to fix the improper cleanup on thrown exception vulnerability, and implement mitigations to reduce the risk associated with the improper handling of exceptional conditions vulnerability. The software update implements messaging and alarming on the MX40 and at the central monitoring station, when the MX40 disconnects from the access point.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9657", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPhilips\u00bbIntellivue Mx40 FirmwareVersions  before (<) b.06.18cpe:2.3:o:philips:intellivue_mx40_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Philips\u00bbIntellivue Mx40\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 2  2023-10-31  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-21  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-05-29  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 5  2023-04-24  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-460 Improper Cleanup on Thrown Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/460/Improper-Cleanup-on-Thrown-Exception.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-255-01", "ref_desc": "Philips' IntelliView MX40 Patient Worn Monitor (WLAN) Vulnerabilities | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ab9C8WVFFbI9glhz2rIGXjPpjmA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/about/customer-support/product-security", "ref_desc": "Product Security | PhilipsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cuWgpmnspxw8IT1JnrRWbNI_cZ4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100813", "ref_desc": "Philips IntelliView MX40 Patient Worn Monitor Multiple Denial of Service VulnerabilitiesVDB Entry;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LbG3EetpY2BNMoF9UgYuMbRSPWM.html"}]}
