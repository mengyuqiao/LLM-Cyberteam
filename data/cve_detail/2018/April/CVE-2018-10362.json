{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10362", "Description": "An issue was discovered in phpLiteAdmin 1.9.5 through 1.9.7.1. Due to loose comparison with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for the user-provided login password, it is possible to login with a simpler password if the password has the form of a power in scientific notation (like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234' for '0'). This is possible because, in the loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number in scientific notation, and thus converts it to a number. After that, the comparison with '==' casts the user input (e.g., the string '200' or '0') to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a '0' or a simple number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents the cast into numbers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10362", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPhpliteadmin\u00bbPhpliteadminVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.5andup to, including, (<=) 1.9.7.1cpe:2.3:a:phpliteadmin:phpliteadmin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-16  0.43%  0.39%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.43%  0.43%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.43%  0.43%  0.00 \n 4  2023-04-04  0.21%  0.43%  +0.22 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://k3research.outerhaven.de/posts/small-mistakes-lead-to-big-problems.html", "ref_desc": "Site not found \u00b7 GitHub PagesTechnical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/phpLiteAdmin/pla/issues/11", "ref_desc": "Authorization bypass in Authorization.php \u00b7 Issue #11 \u00b7 phpLiteAdmin/pla \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
