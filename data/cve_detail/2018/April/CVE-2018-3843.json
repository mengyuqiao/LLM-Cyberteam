{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3843", "Description": "An exploitable type confusion vulnerability exists in the way Foxit PDF Reader version 9.0.1.1049 parses files with associated file annotations. A specially crafted PDF document can lead to an object of invalid type to be dereferenced, which can potentially lead to sensitive memory disclosure, and possibly to arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3843", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFoxitsoftware\u00bbFoxit Reader\u00bbVersion:9.0.1.1049cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:foxit_reader:9.0.1.1049:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "6.86% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  6.48%  6.86%  +0.38 \n 2  2024-03-29  7.66%  6.48%  -1.18 \n 3  2024-02-27  9.19%  7.66%  -1.53 \n 4  2024-02-02  10.72%  9.19%  -1.52 \n 5  2023-11-13  14.41%  10.72%  -3.69 \n 6  2023-10-20  15.58%  14.41%  -1.17 \n 7  2023-09-10  12.04%  15.58%  +3.54 \n 8  2023-07-08  9.82%  12.04%  +2.22 \n 9  2023-06-06  13.26%  9.82%  -3.44 \n 10  2023-04-13  13.17%  13.26%  +0.09 \n 11  2023-03-11  14.24%  13.17%  -1.07 \n 12  2023-03-07  2.58%  14.24%  +11.66 \n 13  2023-01-14  2.51%  2.58%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-704 Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/704/Incorrect-Type-Conversion-or-Cast.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040733", "ref_desc": "Foxit Reader Multiple Flaws Let Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code, Deny Service, and Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information - SecurityTrackerBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7-BM2DQ_vX6B2HQ9qlh7zyH4sZQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103942", "ref_desc": "Foxit Reader Multiple Remote Code Execution VulnerabilitiesBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B17-4_IhdEPZXTDH5YBNkNRStlU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0526", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0526 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
