{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6182", "Description": "Mahara 16.10 before 16.10.9 and 17.04 before 17.04.7 and 17.10 before 17.10.4 are vulnerable to bad input when TinyMCE is bypassed by POST packages. Therefore, Mahara should not rely on TinyMCE's code stripping alone but also clean input on the server / PHP side as one can create own packets of POST data containing bad content with which to hit the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6182", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMahara\u00bbMaharaVersions  from including (>=) 17.04andbefore (<) 17.04.7cpe:2.3:a:mahara:mahara:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMahara\u00bbMaharaVersions  from including (>=) 17.10andbefore (<) 17.10.4cpe:2.3:a:mahara:mahara:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMahara\u00bbMaharaVersions  from including (>=) 16.10andbefore (<) 16.10.9cpe:2.3:a:mahara:mahara:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-02-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mahara.org/interaction/forum/topic.php?id=8215", "ref_desc": "Security Announcements - Security issue relating to cross-site scripting <16.10.9; <17.04.7; <17.10.4 - Mahara ePortfolio SystemVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+bug/1744789", "ref_desc": "Bug #1744789 \u201cAvoid relying on TinyMCE code stripping alone\u201d : Bugs : MaharaIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
