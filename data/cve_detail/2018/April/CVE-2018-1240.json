VRRP defaults to an insecure configuration in Linux's keepalived component which sends the cluster password in plaintext through multicast. A malicious user, having access to the vCloud subnet where ViPR is deployed, could potentially sniff the password and use it to take over the cluster's virtual IP and cause a denial of service on that ViPR Controller system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1240", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nEMC\u00bbVipr ControllerVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0.39andbefore (<) 3.6.1.4cpe:2.3:a:emc:vipr_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Apr/29", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: DSA-2018-071: Dell EMC ViPR Controller Information Exposure VulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
