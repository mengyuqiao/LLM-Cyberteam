A specially crafted PDF document can lead to a dereference of an uninitialized pointer which, if under attacker control, can result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3842", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFoxitsoftware\u00bbFoxit Reader\u00bbVersion:9.0.1.1049cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:foxit_reader:9.0.1.1049:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.73%  1.22%  +0.48 \n 2  2024-02-02  0.87%  0.73%  -0.14 \n 3  2023-11-13  1.23%  0.87%  -0.36 \n 4  2023-10-20  1.35%  1.23%  -0.12 \n 5  2023-09-10  1.37%  1.35%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-07-08  1.67%  1.37%  -0.30 \n 7  2023-06-06  2.35%  1.67%  -0.68 \n 8  2023-04-13  2.33%  2.35%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-11  2.55%  2.33%  -0.22 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.58%  2.55%  -0.03 \n 11  2023-01-14  2.51%  2.58%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/824/Access-of-Uninitialized-Pointer.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0525", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0525 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040733", "ref_desc": "Foxit Reader Multiple Flaws Let Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code, Deny Service, and Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information - SecurityTrackerBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7-BM2DQ_vX6B2HQ9qlh7zyH4sZQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103942", "ref_desc": "Foxit Reader Multiple Remote Code Execution VulnerabilitiesBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B17-4_IhdEPZXTDH5YBNkNRStlU.html"}]}
