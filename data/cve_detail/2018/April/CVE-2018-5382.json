{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5382", "Description": "The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which can allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS keystore. Bouncy Castle release 1.47 changes the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bit HMAC instead. This applies to any BKS keystore generated prior to BC 1.47. For situations where people need to create the files for legacy reasons a specific keystore type \"BKS-V1\" was introduced in 1.49. It should be noted that the use of \"BKS-V1\" is discouraged by the library authors and should only be used where it is otherwise safe to do so, as in where the use of a 16 bit checksum for the file integrity check is not going to cause a security issue in itself.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5382", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbSatellite\u00bbVersion:6.4cpe:2.3:a:redhat:satellite:6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbSatellite Capsule\u00bbVersion:6.4cpe:2.3:a:redhat:satellite_capsule:6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBouncycastle\u00bbLegion-of-the-bouncy-castle-java-crytography-apiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.49cpe:2.3:a:bouncycastle:legion-of-the-bouncy-castle-java-crytography-api:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-04-10  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-354 Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/354/Improper-Validation-of-Integrity-Check-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2020Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1hxRYmo91HRN10Cfg6yN3v4ihMI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/306792", "ref_desc": "VU#306792 - Bouncy Castle BKS-V1 keystore files vulnerable to trivial hash collisionsThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2927", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:2927 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/etlq9PyYPpjTvtluDmixkCuxlWc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.bouncycastle.org/releasenotes.html", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oB8LNf0oBEjXD_91VkefFtbcrtE.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103453", "ref_desc": "Bouncy Castle BKS-V1 CVE-2018-5382 Security WeaknessThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
