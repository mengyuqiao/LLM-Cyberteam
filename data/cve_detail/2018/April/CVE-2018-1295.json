{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1295", "Description": "In Apache Ignite 2.3 or earlier, the serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to one of the deserialization endpoints of some Ignite components - discovery SPI, Ignite persistence, Memcached endpoint, socket steamer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1295", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbIgniteVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:ignite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "5.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.91%  5.11%  +3.20 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.78%  1.91%  +1.13 \n 3  2023-10-03  1.35%  0.78%  -0.57 \n 4  2023-08-24  2.26%  1.35%  -0.91 \n 5  2023-07-08  3.08%  2.26%  -0.82 \n 6  2023-06-25  4.30%  3.08%  -1.22 \n 7  2023-05-01  4.40%  4.30%  -0.10 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  4.40%  +3.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2405", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:2405 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4na_FSRd-pyKjbTf2MeNNh4nm0s.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103692", "ref_desc": "Apache Ignite CVE-2018-1295 Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/45e7d5e2c6face85aab693f5ae0616563132ff757e5a558da80d0209@%3Cdev.ignite.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2018-1295]: Possible Execution of Arbitrary Code Within Deserialization Endpoints of Apache Ignite - Pony MailMitigation;Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
