{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15470", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The logic in oxenstored for handling writes depended on the order of evaluation of expressions making up a tuple. As indicated in section 7.7.3 \"Operations on data structures\" of the OCaml manual, the order of evaluation of subexpressions is not specified. In practice, different implementations behave differently. Thus, oxenstored may not enforce the configured quota-maxentity. This allows a malicious or buggy guest to write as many xenstore entries as it wishes, causing unbounded memory usage in oxenstored. This can lead to a system-wide DoS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15470", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nXEN\u00bbXENVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.11.0cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/11/msg00013.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1577-1] xen security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Iu4MiO0qjgho7uKPBPe3fqq_oXM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201810-06", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201810-06) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NmimDMjWeZ7wFEugsNuVNM0lg-s.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-272.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-272 - Xen Security AdvisoriesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
