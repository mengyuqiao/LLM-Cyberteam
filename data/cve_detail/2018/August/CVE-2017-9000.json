An unauthenticated user with network access to an Aruba mobility controller on TCP port 8080 or 8081 may be able to access arbitrary files stored on the mobility controller. Ports 8080 and 8081 are used for captive portal functionality and are listening, by default, on all IP interfaces of the mobility controller, including captive portal interfaces. The attacker could access files which could contain passwords, keys, and other sensitive information that could lead to full system compromise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9000", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nHP\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 6.4andbefore (<) 6.4.4.16cpe:2.3:o:hp:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHP\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 8.0andbefore (<) 8.1.0.4cpe:2.3:o:hp:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHP\u00bbArubaosVersions  before (<) 6.3.1.25cpe:2.3:o:hp:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHP\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 6.5.4andbefore (<) 6.5.4.2cpe:2.3:o:hp:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHP\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 6.5.0andbefore (<) 6.5.1.9cpe:2.3:o:hp:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHP\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 6.5.3andbefore (<) 6.5.3.3cpe:2.3:o:hp:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHP\u00bbArubaos\u00bbVersion:6.5.2cpe:2.3:o:hp:arubaos:6.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-12-28  0.21%  0.19%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039580", "ref_desc": "Aruba Mobility Controller Multiple Bugs Let Remote Users Access Files and Execute Arbitrary Code and Let Remote Authenticated Users Inject SQL Commands - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mXI4Ey-4K44wAEJqurGXhzfHyXc.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2017-006.txt", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/us-Qk1kPZlme8UNFbVpq_CyEVJc.html"}]}
