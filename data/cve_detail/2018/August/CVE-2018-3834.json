{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3834", "Description": "An exploitable permanent denial of service vulnerability exists in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1013. The firmware upgrade functionality, triggered via PubNub, retrieves signed firmware binaries using plain HTTP requests. The device doesn't check the kind of firmware image that is going to be installed and thus allows for flashing any signed firmware into any MCU. Since the device contains different and incompatible MCUs, flashing one firmware to the wrong MCU will result in a permanent brick condition. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to impersonate the remote server \"cache.insteon.com\" and serve a signed firmware image.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3834", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nInsteon\u00bbHub Firmware\u00bbVersion:1013cpe:2.3:o:insteon:hub_firmware:1013:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Insteon\u00bbHUB\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.09%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-06-11  0.19%  0.14%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.14%  0.19%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0513", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0513 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
