{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16252", "Description": "Specially crafted commands sent through the PubNub service in Insteon Hub 2245-222 with firmware version 1012 can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.At 0x9d014cc0 the value for the cmd key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at $sp+0x11c. This buffer is 20 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16252", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nInsteon\u00bbHub Firmware\u00bbVersion:1012cpe:2.3:o:insteon:hub_firmware:1012:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Insteon\u00bbHub 2245-222\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-15  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0483", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2017-0483 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UFNCAu7RGRcXLfIuenkQGq1dJrk.html"}]}
