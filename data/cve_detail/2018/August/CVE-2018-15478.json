{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15478", "Description": "An issue was discovered in myStrom WiFi Switch V1 before 2.66, WiFi Switch V2 before 3.80, WiFi Switch EU before 3.80, WiFi Bulb before 2.58, WiFi LED Strip before 3.80, WiFi Button before 2.73, and WiFi Button Plus before 2.73. The process of registering a device with a cloud account was based on an activation code derived from the device MAC address. By guessing valid MAC addresses or using MAC addresses printed on devices in shops and reverse engineering the protocol, an attacker would have been able to register previously unregistered devices to their account. When the rightful owner would have connected them after purchase to their WiFi network, the devices would not have registered with their account, would subsequently not have been controllable from the owner's mobile app, and would not have been visible in the owner's account. Instead, they would have been under control of the attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15478", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMystrom\u00bbWifi Switch FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.66cpe:2.3:o:mystrom:wifi_switch_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mystrom\u00bbWifi Switch\u00bbVersion:V1\nMystrom\u00bbWifi Switch FirmwareVersions  before (<) 3.80cpe:2.3:o:mystrom:wifi_switch_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mystrom\u00bbWifi Switch\u00bbVersion:V2\nMystrom\u00bbWifi Button Plus FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.73cpe:2.3:o:mystrom:wifi_button_plus_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mystrom\u00bbWifi Button Plus\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMystrom\u00bbWifi Button FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.73cpe:2.3:o:mystrom:wifi_button_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mystrom\u00bbWifi Button\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMystrom\u00bbWifi Switch Eu FirmwareVersions  before (<) 3.80cpe:2.3:o:mystrom:wifi_switch_eu_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mystrom\u00bbWifi Switch Eu\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMystrom\u00bbWifi Bulb FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.58cpe:2.3:o:mystrom:wifi_bulb_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mystrom\u00bbWifi Bulb\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMystrom\u00bbWifi Led Strip FirmwareVersions  before (<) 3.80cpe:2.3:o:mystrom:wifi_led_strip_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mystrom\u00bbWifi Led Strip\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.31%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.31%  -0.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.swisscom.ch/content/dam/swisscom/de/about/nachhaltigkeit/digitale-schweiz/sicherheit/bug-bounty/files/cve-2018-15476ff.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LUJYoGHbvN-voc2ufTTEkxhv7mg.html"}]}
