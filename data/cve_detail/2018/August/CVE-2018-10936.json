{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10936", "Description": "A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc before version 42.2.5. It was possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was signed by a trusted CA.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10936", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:6.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPostgresql\u00bbPostgresql Jdbc DriverVersions  before (<) 42.2.5cpe:2.3:a:postgresql:postgresql_jdbc_driver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-09-14  0.40%  0.28%  -0.12 \n 3  2024-08-09  0.35%  0.40%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-06-14  0.35%  0.35%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-18  0.39%  0.35%  -0.04 \n 6  2024-01-21  0.48%  0.39%  -0.10 \n 7  2023-12-09  0.49%  0.48%  0.00 \n 8  2023-09-28  0.49%  0.49%  0.00 \n 9  2023-08-24  0.59%  0.49%  -0.10 \n 10  2023-05-08  0.60%  0.59%  0.00 \n 11  2023-03-07  15.35%  0.60%  -14.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-297 Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/297/Improper-Validation-of-Certificate-with-Host-Mismatch.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1883/", "ref_desc": "PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL JDBC 42.2.5 Released (Security Fix CVE-2018-10936)Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-10936", "ref_desc": "1622225 \u2013 (CVE-2018-10936) CVE-2018-10936 PostgreSQL: Postgres JDBC driver does not perform host name validation by defaultMitigation;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/9317fd092b257a0815434b116a8af8daea6e920b6673f4fd5583d5fe@%3Ccommits.druid.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[GitHub] [incubator-druid] ccaominh opened a new pull request #8878: Address security vulnerabilities - Pony MailCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/um10po5mEJZhJ3HIBSMJdMXvMxw.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105220", "ref_desc": "PostgreSQL JDBC CVE-2018-10936 Man in the Middle Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
