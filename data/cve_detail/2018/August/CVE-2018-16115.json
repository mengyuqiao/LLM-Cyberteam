{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16115", "Description": "Lightbend Akka 2.5.x before 2.5.16 allows message disclosure and modification because of an RNG error. A random number generator is used in Akka Remoting for TLS (both classic and Artery Remoting). Akka allows configuration of custom random number generators. For historical reasons, Akka included the AES128CounterSecureRNG and AES256CounterSecureRNG random number generators. The implementations had a bug that caused the generated numbers to be repeated after only a few bytes. The custom RNG implementations were not configured by default but examples in the documentation showed (and therefore implicitly recommended) using the custom ones. This can be used by an attacker to compromise the communication if these random number generators are enabled in configuration. It would be possible to eavesdrop, replay, or modify the messages sent with Akka Remoting/Cluster.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16115", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLightbend\u00bbAkkaVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.16cpe:2.3:a:lightbend:akka:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/security/2018-08-29-aes-rng.html", "ref_desc": "Broken random number generators AES128CounterSecureRNG / AES256CounterSecureRNG, Fixed in Akka 2.5.16 \u2022 Akka DocumentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
