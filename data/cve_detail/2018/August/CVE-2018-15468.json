{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15468", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The DEBUGCTL MSR contains several debugging features, some of which virtualise cleanly, but some do not. In particular, Branch Trace Store is not virtualised by the processor, and software has to be careful to configure it suitably not to lock up the core. As a result, it must only be available to fully trusted guests. Unfortunately, in the case that vPMU is disabled, all value checking was skipped, allowing the guest to choose any MSR_DEBUGCTL setting it likes. A malicious or buggy guest administrator (on Intel x86 HVM or PVH) can lock up the entire host, causing a Denial of Service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15468", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nXEN\u00bbXENVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.11.0cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201810-06", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201810-06) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NmimDMjWeZ7wFEugsNuVNM0lg-s.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-269.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-269 - Xen Security AdvisoriesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
