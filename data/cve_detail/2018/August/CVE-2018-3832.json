{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3832", "Description": "An exploitable firmware update vulnerability exists in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1013. The HTTP server allows for uploading arbitrary MPFS binaries that could be modified to enable access to hidden resources which allow for uploading unsigned firmware images to the device. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker can upload an MPFS binary via the '/mpfsupload' HTTP form and later on upload the firmware via a POST request to 'firmware.htm'.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3832", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nInsteon\u00bbHub 2245-222 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1013cpe:2.3:o:insteon:hub_2245-222_firmware:1013:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Insteon\u00bbHub 2245-222\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-03  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-01-14  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/144976", "ref_desc": "Insteon Hub MPFS binary file upload CVE-2018-3832 Vulnerability ReportThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0511", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0511 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
