{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11456", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Automation License Manager 5 (All versions < 5.3.4.4). An attacker with network access to the device could send specially crafted network packets to determine whether or not a network port on another remote system is accessible or not. This allows the attacker to do basic network scanning using the victims machine. Successful exploitation requires a network connection to the affected device. The attacker does not need privileges, no user interaction is required. The impact is limited to determining whether or not a port on a target system is accessible by the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11456", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbAutomation License ManagerVersions  before (<) 5.3.4.4cpe:2.3:a:siemens:automation_license_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-29  0.09%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105114", "ref_desc": "Siemens Automation License Manager Directory Traversal and Information Disclosure VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DhARsr45msMlQbsfI3xM6IimGOs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-920962.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TY5GOtoPFQ_qCUvZfDopyncjAh0.html"}]}
