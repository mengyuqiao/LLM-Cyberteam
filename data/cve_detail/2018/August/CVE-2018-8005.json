{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8005", "Description": "When there are multiple ranges in a range request, Apache Traffic Server (ATS) will read the entire object from cache. This can cause performance problems with large objects in cache. This affects versions 6.0.0 to 6.2.2 and 7.0.0 to 7.1.3. To resolve this issue users running 6.x users should upgrade to 6.2.3 or later versions and 7.x users should upgrade to 7.1.4 or later versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8005", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbTraffic ServerVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.1.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:traffic_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbTraffic ServerVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 6.2.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:traffic_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.88% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.51%  0.88%  +0.37 \n 2  2024-06-12  0.71%  0.51%  -0.20 \n 3  2024-04-16  0.68%  0.71%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-02-28  0.80%  0.68%  -0.12 \n 5  2024-01-20  1.13%  0.80%  -0.33 \n 6  2023-09-27  1.59%  1.13%  -0.46 \n 7  2023-08-23  1.92%  1.59%  -0.33 \n 8  2023-05-08  1.63%  1.92%  +0.29 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.25%  1.63%  +0.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/55d225af92887bfed0194400fd1b718622cca4140fc7318d982e25ca@%3Cusers.trafficserver.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[ANNOUNCE] Apache Traffic Server vulnerability with multi-range requests - CVE-2018-8005 - Pony MailMitigation;Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/pull/3106", "ref_desc": "Adds a new configuration proxy.config.http.allow_multi_range by zwoop \u00b7 Pull Request #3106 \u00b7 apache/trafficserver \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4282", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4282-1 trafficserverThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fm2Jfh8AI1-ylRNF7wrCsbBfblA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/pull/3124", "ref_desc": "Disables the support for multi-range request by default by zwoop \u00b7 Pull Request #3124 \u00b7 apache/trafficserver \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105187", "ref_desc": "Apache Traffic Server CVE-2018-8005 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
