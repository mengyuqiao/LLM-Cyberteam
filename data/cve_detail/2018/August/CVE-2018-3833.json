{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3833", "Description": "An exploitable firmware downgrade vulnerability exists in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1013. The firmware upgrade functionality, triggered via PubNub, retrieves signed firmware binaries using plain HTTP requests. The device doesn't check the firmware version that is going to be installed and thus allows for flashing older firmware images. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to impersonate the remote server 'cache.insteon.com' and serve any signed firmware image.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3833", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nInsteon\u00bbHub 2245-222 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1013cpe:2.3:o:insteon:hub_2245-222_firmware:1013:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Insteon\u00bbHub 2245-222\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.74% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.52%  0.74%  +0.22 \n 2  2024-04-28  0.96%  0.52%  -0.43 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.96%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0512", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0512 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
