{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15133", "Description": "In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote code execution might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value. This involves the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php and PendingBroadcast in gadgetchains/Laravel/RCE/3/chain.php in phpggc. The attacker must know the application key, which normally would never occur, but could happen if the attacker previously had privileged access or successfully accomplished a previous attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15133", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nLaravel\u00bbLaravelVersions  from including (>=) 5.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.6.29cpe:2.3:a:laravel:laravel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLaravel\u00bbLaravelVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.5.40cpe:2.3:a:laravel:laravel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "88.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  96.26%  88.38%  -7.88 \n 2  2024-11-12  96.79%  96.26%  -0.52 \n 3  2024-07-19  96.90%  96.79%  -0.11 \n 4  2024-06-18  96.77%  96.90%  +0.13 \n 5  2024-06-11  64.97%  96.77%  +31.80 \n 6  2024-04-24  62.42%  64.97%  +2.55 \n 7  2024-01-17  14.42%  62.42%  +48.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  23.85%  14.42%  -9.43 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153641/PHP-Laravel-Framework-Token-Unserialize-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "PHP Laravel Framework Token Unserialize Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ngMl3nn5zbSqVYO9NCp_LFdhbco.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/upgrade#upgrade-5.6.30", "ref_desc": "Upgrade Guide - Laravel - The PHP Framework For Web ArtisansVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
