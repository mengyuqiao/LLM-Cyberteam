{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5392", "Description": "mingw-w64 version 5.0.4 by default produces executables that opt in to ASLR, but are not compatible with ASLR. ASLR is an exploit mitigation technique used by modern Windows platforms. For ASLR to function, Windows executables must contain a relocations table. Despite containing the \"Dynamic base\" PE header, which indicates ASLR compatibility, Windows executables produced by mingw-w64 have the relocations table stripped from them by default. This means that executables produced by mingw-w64 are vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. Windows executables generated by mingw-w64 claim to be ASLR compatible, but are not. Vulnerabilities in such executables are more easily exploitable as a result.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5392", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMingw\u00bbMingw-w64\u00bbVersion:5.0.4cpe:2.3:a:mingw:mingw-w64:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-06-23  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/824/Access-of-Uninitialized-Pointer.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307144", "ref_desc": "VU#307144 - mingw-w64 by default produces executables that opt in to ASLR, but are not compatible with ASLRThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
