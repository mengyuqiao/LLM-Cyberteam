{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-2654", "Description": "jenkins-email-ext before version 2.57.1 is vulnerable to an Information Exposure. The Email Extension Plugins is able to send emails to a dynamically created list of users based on the changelogs, like authors of SCM changes since the last successful build. This could in some cases result in emails being sent to people who have no user account in Jenkins, and in rare cases even people who were not involved in whatever project was being built, due to some mapping based on the local-part of email addresses.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-2654", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbEmail Extension\u00bbForJenkinsVersions  before (<) 2.57.1cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:email_extension:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-06-15  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-03-20/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-03-20Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RfJePy86P_26jVP9-8gfOR9GQvk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-2654", "ref_desc": "1613050 \u2013 (CVE-2017-2654) CVE-2017-2654 jenkins-email-ext: Emails were sent to addresses not associated with actual users of Jenkins by Mailer PluginIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
