{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16337", "Description": "On Insteon Hub 2245-222 devices with firmware version 1012, specially crafted commands sent through the PubNub service can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. At 0x9d01ef24 the value for the s_offset key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at $sp+0x2b0. This buffer is 32 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16337", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nInsteon\u00bbHub 2245-222 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1012cpe:2.3:o:insteon:hub_2245-222_firmware:1012:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Insteon\u00bbHub 2245-222\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0483", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2017-0483 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UFNCAu7RGRcXLfIuenkQGq1dJrk.html"}]}
