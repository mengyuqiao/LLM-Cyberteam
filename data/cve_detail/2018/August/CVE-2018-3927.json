{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3927", "Description": "An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the crash handler of the hubCore binary of the Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 - Firmware version 0.20.17. When hubCore crashes, Google Breakpad is used to record minidumps, which are sent over an insecure HTTPS connection to the backtrace.io service, leading to the exposure of sensitive data. An attacker can impersonate the remote backtrace.io server in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3927", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSamsung\u00bbSth-eth-250 Firmware\u00bbVersion:0.20.17cpe:2.3:o:samsung:sth-eth-250_firmware:0.20.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbSth-eth-250\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0594", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0594 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
