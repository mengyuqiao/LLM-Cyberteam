{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-13434", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the LINE jp.naver.line application 8.8.0 for iOS. The LAContext class for Biometric (TouchID) validation allows authentication bypass by overriding the LAContext return Boolean value to be \"true\" because the kSecAccessControlUserPresence protection mechanism is not used. In other words, an attacker could authenticate with an arbitrary fingerprint.  NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes iOS devices on which a jailbreak has occurred", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13434", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinecorp\u00bbLine\u00bbVersion:8.8.0ForIphone Oscpe:2.3:a:linecorp:line:8.8.0:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/tanprathan/f5133651e438b2ad1b39172d52b56115", "ref_desc": "LINE CVE-2018-13434 Information \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
