{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11050", "Description": "Dell EMC NetWorker versions between 9.0 and 9.1.1.8 through 9.2.1.3, and the version 18.1.0.1 contain a Clear-Text authentication over network vulnerability in the Rabbit MQ Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) component. User credentials are sent unencrypted to the remote AMQP service. An unauthenticated attacker in the same network collision domain, could potentially sniff the password from the network and use it to access the component using the privileges of the compromised user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11050", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbEmc NetworkerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.0cpe:2.3:a:dell:emc_networker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDell\u00bbEmc NetworkerVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.1.8andup to, including, (<=) 9.2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:dell:emc_networker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDell\u00bbEmc Networker\u00bbVersion:18.1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:dell:emc_networker:18.1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-04  0.22%  0.15%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-02-01  0.20%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-23  0.24%  0.20%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-08-30  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-07-26  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104963", "ref_desc": "Dell EMC NetWorker CVE-2018-11050 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Jul/92", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: DSA-2018-120: Dell EMC NetWorker Clear-Text authentication over network vulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041393", "ref_desc": "EMC NetWorker AMQP Flaw Lets Remote Users Monitoring the Network Obtain Passwords - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
