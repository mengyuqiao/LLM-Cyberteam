{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3878", "Description": "Multiple exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the credentials handler of video-core's HTTP server of Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17. The video-core process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. A strncpy overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"region\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3878", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nSamsung\u00bbSth-eth-250 Firmware\u00bbVersion:0.20.17cpe:2.3:o:samsung:sth-eth-250_firmware:0.20.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbSth-eth-250\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0555", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0555 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
