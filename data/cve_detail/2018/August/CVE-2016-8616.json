{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-8616", "Description": "A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0 When re-using a connection, curl was doing case insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing connections. This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists for a protocol that has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that connection to be reused if s/he knows the case-insensitive version of the correct password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8616", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHaxx\u00bbCurlVersions  before (<) 7.51.0cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.57%  0.37%  -0.20 \n 2  2024-11-04  0.56%  0.57%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-01  0.52%  0.56%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-12-23  0.56%  0.52%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-07-26  0.49%  0.56%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.54%  0.49%  -1.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-255", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/255/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-592", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/592/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201701-47", "ref_desc": "cURL: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201701-47) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0MfPbV-zeFRNZCeFr7V0g2_ef0c.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html", "ref_desc": "CPU Oct 2018PatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6ieRY3V60WxWvSRSk7f3HJyFhms.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2016-8616.patch", "ref_desc": "Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102B.html", "ref_desc": "curl - case insensitive password comparison - CVE-2016-8616Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2016-21", "ref_desc": "[R2] LCE 4.8.2 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities - Security Advisory | Tenable\u00aeThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ewtvNfDRIowrgVs4-4sUo3A2k34.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:3558 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mgUQtPdB9O4CF8H7o6t0UsX6ajo.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94094", "ref_desc": "cURL/libcURL CVE-2016-8616 Remote Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-8616", "ref_desc": "1388371 \u2013 (CVE-2016-8616) CVE-2016-8616 curl: Case insensitive password comparisonIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2486", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:2486 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Z3ydokE4jjDFS3B7j6IpX8DziAY.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037192", "ref_desc": "cURL/libcurl Multiple Bugs Let Remote Users Inject Cookies, Reuse Connections, and Execute Arbitrary Code and Let Local Users Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information and Execute Arbitrary Code - SecuThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZlwS817KsVGiGwEsi534XFt8UgE.html"}]}
