{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14452", "Description": "An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the PubNub message handler for the \"control\" channel of Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. Specially crafted replies received from the PubNub service can cause buffer overflows on a global section overwriting arbitrary data. A strcpy overflows the buffer insteon_pubnub.channel_cc_r, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"c_r\" parameter in order to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker should impersonate PubNub and answer an HTTPS GET request to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14452", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nInsteon\u00bbHub Firmware\u00bbVersion:1012cpe:2.3:o:insteon:hub_firmware:1012:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Insteon\u00bbHUB\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0502", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2017-0502 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_KQqEn-tHRXWrfvTXpBEXaaal-k.html"}]}
