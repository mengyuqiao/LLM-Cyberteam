{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16790", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Symfony before 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13, 3.4-BETA5, and 4.0-BETA5. When a form is submitted by the user, the request handler classes of the Form component merge POST data and uploaded files data into one array. This big array forms the data that are then bound to the form. At this stage there is no difference anymore between submitted POST data and uploaded files. A user can send a crafted HTTP request where the value of a \"FileType\" is sent as normal POST data that could be interpreted as a local file path on the server-side (for example, \"file:///etc/passwd\"). If the application did not perform any additional checks about the value submitted to the \"FileType\", the contents of the given file on the server could have been exposed to the attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16790", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.2.13cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 3.3.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.3.12cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.7.37cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 2.8.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.8.30cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4262", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4262-1 symfonyThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ljXTCEeJZ3qkXEBfbjiF8cCHfy4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://symfony.com/blog/cve-2017-16790-ensure-that-submitted-data-are-uploaded-files", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-16790: Ensure that submitted data are uploaded files (Symfony Blog)Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
