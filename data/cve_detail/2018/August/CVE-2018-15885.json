{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15885", "Description": "Ovation FindMe 1.4-1083-1 is intended to support transmission of network traffic from covert video recorders but does not properly disrupt binary analysis for discovering the product's capabilities or purpose. This makes it easier for adversaries to detect the covert operation. Specifically, the product uses a compression technique to prevent the identification of certain libraries in the software by obfuscation. The software relies on a TLS callback and an additional executable file to enable these libraries and their access to certain websites. The unpacked software can be exploited by several different types of documented techniques.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15885", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nOvation\u00bbFindme\u00bbVersion:1.4-1083-1cpe:2.3:a:ovation:findme:1.4-1083-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.50%  0.97%  +0.47 \n 2  2023-05-13  0.35%  0.50%  +0.15 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.35%  -0.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/GitHubAssessments/CVE_Assessment_02_2018/blob/master/FindMe_Report.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVE_Assessment_02_2018/FindMe_Report.pdf at master \u00b7 GitHubAssessments/CVE_Assessment_02_2018 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
