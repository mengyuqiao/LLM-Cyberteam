{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15907", "Description": "Technicolor (formerly RCA) TC8305C devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (networking outage) via a flood of random MAC addresses, as demonstrated by macof. NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2018-15852 and CVE-2018-16310. NOTE: Technicolor denies that the described behavior is a vulnerability and states that Wi-Fi traffic is slowed or stopped only while the devices are exposed to a MAC flooding attack. This has been confirmed through testing against official up-to-date versions", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15907", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nTechnicolor\u00bbTc8305c Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:technicolor:tc8305c_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Technicolor\u00bbTc8305c\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-08  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-08  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bkd00r.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/cve-2018-15907-exploit-title-techniclor-formerly-rca-tc8305c-wireless-gateway-802-11b-g-n-gigaport-x-4-port-router-w-2-voice-lines-xfinity-comcast-buffer-overflow/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-15907 # Exploit Title:- Techniclor Formerly RCA TC8305C Wireless Gateway 802.11b/g/n GigaPort x 4 Port Router w/ 2-Voice Lines XFINITY / COMCAST \u2013 Buffer Overflow \u2013 B4cKD00\u20b9Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
