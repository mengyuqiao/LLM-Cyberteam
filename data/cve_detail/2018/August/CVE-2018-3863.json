{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3863", "Description": "On Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17, the video-core process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. A strcpy overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 40 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"user\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3863", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nSamsung\u00bbSth-eth-250 Firmware\u00bbVersion:0.20.17cpe:2.3:o:samsung:sth-eth-250_firmware:0.20.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbSth-eth-250\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0548", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0548 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
