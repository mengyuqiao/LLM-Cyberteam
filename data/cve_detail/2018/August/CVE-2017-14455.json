{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14455", "Description": "On Insteon Hub 2245-222 devices with firmware version 1012, specially crafted replies received from the PubNub service can cause buffer overflows on a global section overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should impersonate PubNub and answer an HTTPS GET request to trigger this vulnerability. A strcpy overflows the buffer insteon_pubnub.channel_ak, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"ak\" parameter in order to exploit this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14455", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nInsteon\u00bbHub 2245-222 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1012cpe:2.3:o:insteon:hub_2245-222_firmware:1012:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Insteon\u00bbHub 2245-222\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2024-04-03  0.11%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-01-14  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0502", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2017-0502 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_KQqEn-tHRXWrfvTXpBEXaaal-k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/144975", "ref_desc": "Insteon Hub UpdateCheck command buffer overflow CVE-2017-14455 Vulnerability ReportThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
