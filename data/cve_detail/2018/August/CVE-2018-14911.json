{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14911", "Description": "A file upload vulnerability exists in ukcms v1.1.7 and earlier. The vulnerability is due to the system not strictly filtering the file upload type. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to upload a script Trojan to admin.php/admin/configset/index/group/upload.html to gain server control by composing a request for a .txt upload and then changing it to a .php upload. The attacker must have admin access to change the upload_file_ext (aka \"Allow upload file suffix\") setting, and must use \"php,php\" in this setting to bypass the \"php\" restriction.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14911", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nUkcms\u00bbUkcmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.1.7cpe:2.3:a:ukcms:ukcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-09  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yxcmf/ukcms/issues/1", "ref_desc": "ukcms v1.1.7 (and other Lower version ) has a FileUpload vulnerability \u00b7 Issue #1 \u00b7 yxcmf/ukcms \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
