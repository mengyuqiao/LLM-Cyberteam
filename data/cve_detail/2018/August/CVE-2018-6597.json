{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6597", "Description": "The Alcatel A30 device with a build fingerprint of TCL/5046G/MICKEY6US:7.0/NRD90M/J63:user/release-keys contains a hidden privilege escalation capability to achieve command execution as the root user. They have made modifications that allow a user with physical access to the device to obtain a root shell via ADB. Modifying the read-only properties by an app as the system user creates a UNIX domain socket named factory_test that will execute commands as the root user by processes that have privilege to access it (as per the SELinux rules that the vendor controls).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6597", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAlcatel\u00bbA30 Firmware\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:alcatel:a30_firmware:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Alcatel\u00bbA30\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.07%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/", "ref_desc": "Kryptowire Provides Details on DEFCON 2018 Presentation: Vulnerable Out of the Box - An Evaluation of Android Carrier Devices - KryptowireThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ePdPR6-heyAn2FjJ19P0pu_CWlA.html"}]}
