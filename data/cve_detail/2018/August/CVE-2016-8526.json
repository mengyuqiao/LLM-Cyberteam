{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-8526", "Description": "Aruba Airwave all versions up to, but not including, 8.2.3.1 is vulnerable to an XML external entities (XXE). XXEs are a way to permit XML parsers to access storage that exist on external systems. If an unprivileged user is permitted to control the contents of XML files, XXE can be used as an attack vector. Because the XML parser has access to the local filesystem and runs with the permissions of the web server, it can access any file that is readable by the web server and copy it to an external system of the attacker's choosing. This could include files that contain passwords, which could then lead to privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8526", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nHP\u00bbAirwaveVersions  before (<) 8.2.3.1cpe:2.3:a:hp:airwave:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.57%  0.54%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-05-21  0.68%  0.57%  -0.11 \n 3  2024-03-01  0.97%  0.68%  -0.28 \n 4  2024-01-18  1.37%  0.97%  -0.40 \n 5  2023-12-28  1.95%  1.37%  -0.59 \n 6  2023-12-06  2.74%  1.95%  -0.79 \n 7  2023-07-31  2.72%  2.74%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-04-03  3.57%  2.72%  -0.85 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  3.57%  +2.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2017-001.txt", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fQ0IAF7of7RZ7imJqSoUcfD2DaQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96495", "ref_desc": "AirWave Management Platform Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IQwz5dqq68O9rtGTRFgAroHUu3M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41482/", "ref_desc": "Aruba AirWave 8.2.3 - XML External Entity Injection / Cross-Site ScriptingExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/K-wB4ygsCfr7qS6wvxnW-sUsJlM.html"}]}
