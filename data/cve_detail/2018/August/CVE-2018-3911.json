{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-3911", "Description": "An exploitable HTTP header injection vulnerability exists in the remote servers of Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 - Firmware version 0.20.17. The hubCore process listens on port 39500 and relays any unauthenticated message to SmartThings' remote servers, which insecurely handle JSON messages, leading to partially controlled requests generated toward the internal video-core process. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3911", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSamsung\u00bbSth-eth-250 Firmware\u00bbVersion:0.20.17cpe:2.3:o:samsung:sth-eth-250_firmware:0.20.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbSth-eth-250\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-04  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.11%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/113/Improper-Neutralization-of-CRLF-Sequences-in-HTTP-Headers-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0578", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0578 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
