{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5235", "Description": "Norton Utilities (prior to 16.0.3.44) may be susceptible to a DLL Preloading vulnerability, which is a type of issue that can occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5235", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSymantec\u00bbNorton UtilitiesVersions  before (<) 16.0.3.44cpe:2.3:a:symantec:norton_utilities:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.04%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105099", "ref_desc": "Symantec Norton Utilities CVE-2018-5235 DLL Loading Local Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.SYMSA1459.html", "ref_desc": "Norton Utilities, Norton Power Eraser & Symdiag - DLL PreloadingMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iyMcBYdDOixS1Yo5899IXVLe8xc.html"}]}
