{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7166", "Description": "In all versions of Node.js 10 prior to 10.9.0, an argument processing flaw can cause `Buffer.alloc()` to return uninitialized memory. This method is intended to be safe and only return initialized, or cleared, memory. The third argument specifying `encoding` can be passed as a number, this is misinterpreted by `Buffer's` internal \"fill\" method as the `start` to a fill operation. This flaw may be abused where `Buffer.alloc()` arguments are derived from user input to return uncleared memory blocks that may contain sensitive information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7166", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.9.0cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.15%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-226 Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/226/Sensitive-Information-in-Resource-Not-Removed-Before-Reuse.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/908/Use-of-Uninitialized-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/august-2018-security-releases/", "ref_desc": "August 2018 Security Releases | Node.jsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DRrjo7FRYmi4AoDRn6gvMENAdX4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2553", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:2553 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rLibi6yAimINsDur71gGtojGPBk.html"}]}
