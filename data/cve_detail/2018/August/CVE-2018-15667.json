{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15667", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Bloop Airmail 3 3.5.9 for macOS. It registers and uses the airmail:// URL scheme. The \"send\" command in the URL scheme allows an external application to send arbitrary emails from an active account without authentication. The handler has no restriction on who can use its functionality. The handler can be invoked using any method that invokes the URL handler such as a hyperlink in an email. The user is not prompted when the handler processes the \"send\" command, thus leading to automatic transmission of an attacker crafted email from the target account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15667", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAirmailapp\u00bbAirmail\u00bbVersion:3.3.5.9cpe:2.3:a:airmailapp:airmail:3.3.5.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-30  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://versprite.com/advisories/airmail-3-for-mac/", "ref_desc": "Airmail 3 for Mac - Scheme Handler Incorrect Access ControlThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
