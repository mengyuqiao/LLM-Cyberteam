{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14028", "Description": "In WordPress 4.9.7, plugins uploaded via the admin area are not verified as being ZIP files. This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine's wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14028", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWordpress\u00bbWordpress\u00bbVersion:4.9.7cpe:2.3:a:wordpress:wordpress:4.9.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "10.85% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  19.29%  10.85%  -8.45 \n 2  2024-08-25  24.98%  19.29%  -5.69 \n 3  2024-07-20  31.60%  24.98%  -6.61 \n 4  2024-01-01  33.05%  31.60%  -1.46 \n 5  2023-11-19  40.49%  33.05%  -7.44 \n 6  2023-09-27  48.24%  40.49%  -7.75 \n 7  2023-09-08  55.71%  48.24%  -7.48 \n 8  2023-08-04  63.28%  55.71%  -7.57 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  63.28%  +62.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44710", "ref_desc": "#44710 (Upload plugin and theme functionalities are not removing uploaded files after failure conditions.) \u2013 WordPress TracThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105060", "ref_desc": "WordPress CVE-2018-14028 Arbitrary File Upload VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rastating.github.io/unrestricted-file-upload-via-plugin-uploader-in-wordpress/", "ref_desc": "Unrestricted File Upload via Plugin Uploader in WordPress | rastating.github.ioThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rastating/wordpress-exploit-framework/pull/52", "ref_desc": "upload non-encapsulated payload when zip installation fails by viniciusmarangoni \u00b7 Pull Request #52 \u00b7 rastating/wordpress-exploit-framework \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
