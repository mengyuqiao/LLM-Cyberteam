{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1000224", "Description": "Godot Engine version All versions prior to 2.1.5, all 3.0 versions prior to 3.0.6. contains a Signed/unsigned comparison, wrong buffer size chackes, integer overflow, missing padding initialization vulnerability in (De)Serialization functions (core/io/marshalls.cpp) that can result in DoS (packet of death), possible leak of uninitialized memory. This attack appear to be exploitable via A malformed packet is received over the network by a Godot application that uses built-in serialization (e.g. game server, or game client). Could be triggered by multiplayer opponent. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 2.1.5, 3.0.6, master branch after commit feaf03421dda0213382b51aff07bd5a96b29487b.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000224", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGodotengine\u00bbGodotVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.6cpe:2.3:a:godotengine:godot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGodotengine\u00bbGodotVersions  before (<) 2.1.5cpe:2.3:a:godotengine:godot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.24%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.12%  0.26%  +0.15 \n 3  2024-05-24  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-10  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-04-25  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-03-15  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-02-09  0.26%  0.09%  -0.18 \n 8  2023-08-14  0.19%  0.26%  +0.07 \n 9  2023-03-07  5.74%  0.19%  -5.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/131/Incorrect-Calculation-of-Buffer-Size.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-681 Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/681/Incorrect-Conversion-between-Numeric-Types.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/908/Use-of-Uninitialized-Resource.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-909 Missing Initialization of Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/909/Missing-Initialization-of-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-2-1-5", "ref_desc": "Godot Engine - Maintenance release: Godot 2.1.5Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20558", "ref_desc": "Godot serialization security issues (CVE-2018-1000224) \u00b7 Issue #20558 \u00b7 godotengine/godot \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-0-6", "ref_desc": "Godot Engine - Maintenance release: Godot 3.0.6Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
