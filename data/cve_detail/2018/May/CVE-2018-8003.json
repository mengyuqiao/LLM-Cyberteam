{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8003", "Description": "Apache Ambari, versions 1.4.0 to 2.6.1, is susceptible to a directory traversal attack allowing an unauthenticated user to craft an HTTP request which provides read-only access to any file on the filesystem of the host the Ambari Server runs on that is accessible by the user the Ambari Server is running as. Direct network access to the Ambari Server is required to issue this request, and those Ambari Servers that are protected behind a firewall, or in a restricted network zone are at less risk of being affected by this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8003", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbAmbariVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:ambari:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-09-24  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Ambari+Vulnerabilities#AmbariVulnerabilities-CVE-2018-8003", "ref_desc": "Ambari Vulnerabilities - Apache Ambari - Apache Software FoundationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104161", "ref_desc": "Apache Ambari CVE-2018-8003 Directory Traversal VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
