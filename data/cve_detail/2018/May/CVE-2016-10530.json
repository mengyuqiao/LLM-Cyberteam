{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10530", "Description": "The airbrake module 0.3.8 and earlier defaults to sending environment variables over HTTP. Environment variables can often times contain secret keys and other sensitive values. A malicious user could be on the same network as a regular user and intercept all the secret keys the user is sending. This goes against common best practice, which is to use HTTPS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10530", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nAirbrake\u00bbAirbrake\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.3.8cpe:2.3:a:airbrake:airbrake:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-22  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.17%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-310", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/310/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/airbrake/node-airbrake/issues/70", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/96", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
