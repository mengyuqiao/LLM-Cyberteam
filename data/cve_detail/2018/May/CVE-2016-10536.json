{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10536", "Description": "engine.io-client is the client for engine.io, the implementation of a transport-based cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. The vulnerability is related to the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized` setting. If the value is something that evaluates to false, certificate verification will be disabled. This is problematic as engine.io-client 1.6.8 and earlier passes in an object for settings that includes the rejectUnauthorized property, whether it has been set or not. If the value has not been explicitly changed, it will be passed in as `null`, resulting in certificate verification being turned off.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10536", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSocket\u00bbEngine.io-client\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.6.8cpe:2.3:a:socket:engine.io-client:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-22  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.17%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-05-25  0.19%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.14%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-300 Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/300/Channel-Accessible-by-Non-Endpoint.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-client/commit/2c55b278a491bf45313ecc0825cf800e2f7ff5c1", "ref_desc": "default `rejectUnauthorized` to `true` \u00b7 socketio/engine.io-client@2c55b27 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cigital.com/blog/node-js-socket-io/", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/99", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
