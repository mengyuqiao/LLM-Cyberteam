{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10831", "Description": "Z-NOMP before 2018-04-05 has an incorrect Equihash solution verifier that allows attackers to spoof mining shares, as demonstrated by providing a solution with {x1=1,x2=1,x3=1,...,x512=1} to bypass this verifier for any blockheader. This originally affected (for example) the Bitcoin Gold and Zcash cryptocurrencies, and continued to be exploited in the wild in May 2018 against smaller cryptocurrencies.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10831", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZclassic\u00bbZ-nompVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.5cpe:2.3:a:zclassic:z-nomp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.30%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-03-18  0.44%  0.24%  -0.20 \n 3  2023-10-01  0.43%  0.44%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.43%  -0.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.zencash.com/update-for-the-equihash-mining-application-z-nomp/", "ref_desc": "Update for the Equihash Mining Application Z-NOMP - HorizenThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/edwardz246003/misc/blob/master/Attackers%20Fake%20Computational%20Power%20to%20Steal%20Cryptocurrencies%20from%20Mining%20Pools.md", "ref_desc": "misc/Attackers Fake Computational Power to Steal Cryptocurrencies from Mining Pools.md at master \u00b7 edwardz246003/misc \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
