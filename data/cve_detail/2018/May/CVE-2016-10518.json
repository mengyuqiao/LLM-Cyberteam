{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10518", "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the ping functionality of the ws module before 1.0.0 which allowed clients to allocate memory by sending a ping frame. The ping functionality by default responds with a pong frame and the previously given payload of the ping frame. This is exactly what you expect, but internally ws always transforms all data that we need to send to a Buffer instance and that is where the vulnerability existed. ws didn't do any checks for the type of data it was sending. With buffers in node when you allocate it when a number instead of a string it will allocate the amount of bytes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10518", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nWs Project\u00bbWS\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:ws_project:ws:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-22  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.28%  0.15%  -0.13 \n 3  2023-05-25  0.30%  0.28%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.17%  0.30%  +0.14 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.17%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/201/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-Into-Sent-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/c0nrad/e92005446c480707a74a", "ref_desc": "Incorrect advisory https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/67 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/1.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release Buffer vulnerability \u00b7 websockets/ws \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/67", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
