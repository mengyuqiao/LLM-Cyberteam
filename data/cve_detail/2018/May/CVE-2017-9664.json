{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9664", "Description": "In ABB SREA-01 revisions A, B, C: application versions up to 3.31.5, and SREA-50 revision A: application versions up to 3.32.8, an attacker may access internal files of ABB SREA-01 and SREA-50 legacy remote monitoring tools without any authorization over the network using a HTTP request which refers to files using ../../ relative paths. Once the internal password file is retrieved, the password hash can be identified using a brute force attack. There is also an exploit allowing running of commands after authorization.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9664", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nABB\u00bbSrea-50 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.32.8cpe:2.3:o:abb:srea-50_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:ABB\u00bbSrea-50\u00bbVersion:N/A\nABB\u00bbSrea-01 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.31.5cpe:2.3:o:abb:srea-01_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:ABB\u00bbSrea-01\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-15  0.31%  0.20%  -0.11 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.31%  -0.57 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100260", "ref_desc": "ABB SREA-01 and SREA-50 CVE-2017-9664 Directory Traversal VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-17-222-05", "ref_desc": "ABB SREA-01 and SREA-50 | CISAMitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
