{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7158", "Description": "The `'path'` module in the Node.js 4.x release line contains a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, `splitPathRe`, used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`, `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7158", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.9.1cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.1.2cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-09  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-185 Incorrect Regular Expression", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/185/Incorrect-Regular-Expression.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/", "ref_desc": "March 2018 Security Releases | Node.jsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JL9UK6rHwbSY0eN7UGPWXX76NHo.html"}]}
