{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7406", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Foxit Reader before 9.1 and PhantomPDF before 9.1. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the u3d images inside of a pdf. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an array indexing issue. An attacker can leverage this to execute code in the context of the current process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7406", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFoxitsoftware\u00bbReaderVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.0.1.1049cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFoxitsoftware\u00bbPhantompdfVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.0.1.1049cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:phantompdf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.76% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.20%  2.76%  -0.44 \n 2  2024-05-03  3.25%  3.20%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-04-02  3.18%  3.25%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-10-15  2.47%  3.18%  +0.71 \n 5  2023-05-18  2.08%  2.47%  +0.38 \n 6  2023-03-07  4.10%  2.08%  -2.01 \n 7  2023-02-18  3.99%  4.10%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/129/Improper-Validation-of-Array-Index.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2018-0017/", "ref_desc": "Source InciteThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104300", "ref_desc": "Foxit Reader and PhantomPDF Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Hrmbrs1Q05ZVBKYaDlq0UKSFBWc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php", "ref_desc": "Security Bulletins | Foxit SoftwareVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jMnbASCwj0zoMu27sNpzmpvRmKs.html"}]}
