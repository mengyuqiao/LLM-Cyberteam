{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7160", "Description": "The Node.js inspector, in 6.x and later is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7160", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.8.1cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.10.0cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 8.9.0andbefore (<) 8.11.0cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 6.9.0andbefore (<) 6.14.0cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 6.8.1cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.86% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.26%  1.86%  -1.40 \n 2  2024-02-29  3.31%  3.26%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-02-09  3.23%  3.31%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-11-08  3.27%  3.23%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-10-08  3.15%  3.27%  +0.12 \n 6  2023-07-08  4.38%  3.15%  -1.23 \n 7  2023-05-11  4.35%  4.38%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-05-08  3.13%  4.35%  +1.22 \n 9  2023-03-07  4.97%  3.13%  -1.84 \n 10  2023-02-11  4.84%  4.97%  +0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-350 Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/350/Reliance-on-Reverse-DNS-Resolution-for-a-Security-Critical-A.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K63025104?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cR8g1Fsr7Q5tk8VOnNvdx9siI1k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/", "ref_desc": "March 2018 Security Releases | Node.jsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JL9UK6rHwbSY0eN7UGPWXX76NHo.html"}]}
