{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10646", "Description": "CyberGhost 6.5.0.3180 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability through the \"CG6Service\" service. This service establishes a NetNamedPipe endpoint that allows arbitrary installed applications to connect and call publicly exposed methods. The \"ConnectToVpnServer\" method accepts a \"connectionParams\" argument that provides attacker control of the OpenVPN command line. An attacker can specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10646", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCyberghostvpn\u00bbCyberghost\u00bbVersion:6.5.0.3180ForWindowscpe:2.3:a:cyberghostvpn:cyberghost:6.5.0.3180:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.04%  -1.09 \n 2  2023-01-27  1.04%  1.14%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/VerSprite/research/blob/master/advisories/VS-2018-023.md", "ref_desc": "research/VS-2018-023.md at master \u00b7 VerSprite/research \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
