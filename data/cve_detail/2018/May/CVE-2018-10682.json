{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10682", "Description": "An issue was discovered in WildFly 10.1.2.Final. It is possible for an attacker to access the administration panel on TCP port 9990 without any authentication using \"anonymous\" access that is automatically created. Once logged in, a misconfiguration present by default (auto-deployment) permits an anonymous user to deploy a malicious .war file, leading to remote code execution. NOTE: the vendor indicates that anonymous access is not available in the default installation; however, it remains optional because there are several use cases for it, including development environments and network architectures that have a proxy server for access control to the WildFly server", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10682", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nWildfly\u00bbWildfly\u00bbVersion:10.1.2UpdateFinalcpe:2.3:a:wildfly:wildfly:10.1.2:final:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.77%  2.51%  +0.74 \n 2  2024-12-10  1.43%  1.77%  +0.35 \n 3  2024-08-12  1.39%  1.43%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-24  1.23%  1.39%  +0.16 \n 5  2024-04-18  1.74%  1.23%  -0.51 \n 6  2024-03-18  1.69%  1.74%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.27%  1.69%  +0.42 \n 8  2023-02-03  1.16%  1.27%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kmkz/exploit/blob/master/CVE-2018-10682-CVE-2018-10683.txt", "ref_desc": "exploit/CVE-2018-10682-CVE-2018-10683.txt at master \u00b7 kmkz/exploit \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wQjPHRhKOvwuski-hym8X7Ni958.html"}]}
