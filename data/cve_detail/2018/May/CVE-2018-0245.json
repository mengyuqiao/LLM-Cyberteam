{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0245", "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco 5500 and 8500 Series Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view system information that under normal circumstances should be prohibited. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input and validation checking mechanisms in the REST API URL request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious URL to the REST API. If successful, an exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive system information.
