{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10562", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Dasan GPON home routers. Command Injection can occur via the dest_host parameter in a diag_action=ping request to a GponForm/diag_Form URI. Because the router saves ping results in /tmp and transmits them to the user when the user revisits /diag.html, it's quite simple to execute commands and retrieve their output.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10562", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDasannetworks\u00bbGpon Router Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:dasannetworks:gpon_router_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dasannetworks\u00bbGpon Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "97.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.42%  97.10%  -0.32 \n 2  2024-02-17  97.44%  97.42%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-11-27  97.50%  97.44%  -0.06 \n 4  2023-10-15  97.53%  97.50%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-09-24  97.56%  97.53%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-09-02  97.58%  97.56%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-07-26  97.57%  97.58%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-06-20  97.57%  97.57%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-06-01  97.57%  97.57%  -0.01 \n 10  2023-05-15  97.59%  97.57%  -0.02 \n 11  2023-04-27  97.58%  97.59%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-25  97.59%  97.58%  -0.01 \n 13  2023-03-07  22.17%  97.59%  +75.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/critical-vulnerability-gpon-router/", "ref_desc": "Critical RCE Vulnerability Found in Over a Million GPON Home RoutersExploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2T7H2n18cJmwNViZJgC-pbwK1Rw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44576/", "ref_desc": "GPON Routers - Authentication Bypass / Command InjectionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8G5BtCyFGXfxPmsm-DMHiiBgLE0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107053", "ref_desc": "Multiple Dasan GPON Routers Command Injection and Authentication Bypass VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Gfmq1_hUm3eRETsTNkv5CL0A2A0.html"}]}
