{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5256", "Description": "CoreOS Tectonic 1.7.x before 1.7.9-tectonic.4 and 1.8.x before 1.8.4-tectonic.3 mounts a direct proxy to the kubernetes cluster at /api/kubernetes/ which is accessible without authentication to Tectonic and allows an attacker to directly connect to the kubernetes API server. Unauthenticated users are able to list all Namespaces through the Console, resulting in an information disclosure. Tectonic's exposure of an unauthenticated API endpoint containing information regarding the internal state of the cluster can provide an attacker with information that may assist in other attacks against the cluster. For example, an attacker may not have the permissions required to list all namespaces in the cluster but can instead leverage this vulnerability to enumerate the namespaces and then begin to check each namespace for weak authorization policies that may allow further escalation of privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5256", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbTectonicVersions  from including (>=) 1.8.4-tectonic.1andbefore (<) 1.8.4-tectonic.3cpe:2.3:a:redhat:tectonic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbTectonicVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.1-tectonic.1andbefore (<) 1.7.9-tectonic.4cpe:2.3:a:redhat:tectonic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://coreos.com/tectonic/releases/#1.8.4-tectonic.3", "ref_desc": "Tectonic Enterprise Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://coreos.com/blog/tectonic-namespace-information-disclosure-vulnerability-patched", "ref_desc": "Tectonic Security Update Available to Address Namespace Information Disclosure Vulnerability | CoreOSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
