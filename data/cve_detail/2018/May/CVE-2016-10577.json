{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10577", "Description": "ibm_db is an asynchronous/synchronous interface for node.js to IBM DB2 and IBM Informix. ibm_db before 1.0.2 downloads binary resources over HTTP, which leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker controlled binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10577", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nIBM\u00bbIbm Db\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.0.2cpe:2.3:a:ibm:ibm_db:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-30  0.55%  1.12%  +0.57 \n 2  2024-04-05  0.78%  0.55%  -0.23 \n 3  2024-03-05  0.78%  0.78%  0.00 \n 4  2023-10-20  0.75%  0.78%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.75%  0.75%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-06-27  0.53%  0.75%  +0.22 \n 7  2023-05-23  0.47%  0.53%  +0.06 \n 8  2023-05-08  0.47%  0.47%  0.00 \n 9  2023-04-04  0.34%  0.47%  +0.13 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.17%  0.34%  -1.82 \n 11  2023-02-23  1.98%  2.17%  +0.19 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-310", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/310/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/163", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ibmdb/node-ibm_db/commit/d7e2d4b4cbeb6f067df8bba7d0b2ac5d40fcfc19#diff-315091eb1586966006e05ebc21cd2a94", "ref_desc": "fix for issue #208 \u00b7 ibmdb/node-ibm_db@d7e2d4b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
