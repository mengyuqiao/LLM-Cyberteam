{"CVE Code": "CVE-2014-10067", "Description": "paypal-ipn before 3.0.0 uses the `test_ipn` parameter (which is set by the PayPal IPN simulator) to determine if it should use the production PayPal site or the sandbox. With a bit of time, an attacker could craft a request using the simulator that would fool any application which does not explicitly check for test_ipn in production.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-10067", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPaypal-ipn Project\u00bbPaypal-ipn\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:paypal-ipn_project:paypal-ipn:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-20  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.19%  0.15%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/26", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/andzdroid/paypal-ipn/issues/11", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
