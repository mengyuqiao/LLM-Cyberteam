{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10526", "Description": "A common setup to deploy to gh-pages on every commit via a CI system is to expose a github token to ENV and to use it directly in the auth part of the url. In module versions < 0.9.1 the auth portion of the url is outputted as part of the grunt tasks logging function. If this output is publicly available then the credentials should be considered compromised.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10526", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGrunt-gh-pages Project\u00bbGrunt-gh-pages\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.9.1cpe:2.3:a:grunt-gh-pages_project:grunt-gh-pages:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-22  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.19%  0.15%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-255", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/255/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-391 Unchecked Error Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/391/Unchecked-Error-Condition.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-gh-pages/pull/41", "ref_desc": "fix: not logging auth part of repo url by boennemann \u00b7 Pull Request #41 \u00b7 tschaub/grunt-gh-pages \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/85", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
