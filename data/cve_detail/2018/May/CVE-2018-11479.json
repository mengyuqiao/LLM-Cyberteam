{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11479", "Description": "The VPN component in Windscribe 1.81 uses the OpenVPN client for connections. Also, it creates a WindScribeService.exe system process that establishes a \\\\.\\pipe\\WindscribeService named pipe endpoint that allows the Windscribe VPN process to connect and execute an OpenVPN process or other processes (like taskkill, etc.). There is no validation of the program name before constructing the lpCommandLine argument for a CreateProcess call. An attacker can run any malicious process with SYSTEM privileges through this named pipe.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11479", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nWindscribe\u00bbWindscribe\u00bbVersion:1.81cpe:2.3:a:windscribe:windscribe:1.81:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-19  0.19%  0.18%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-11-25  0.18%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 4  2023-05-19  0.16%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  11.61%  0.16%  -11.45 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156222/Windscribe-WindscribeService-Named-Pipe-Privilege-Escalation.html", "ref_desc": "Windscribe WindscribeService Named Pipe Privilege Escalation \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sqlulz.blogspot.com/2018/05/windscribe-vpn-privilege-escalation.html", "ref_desc": "vmcs: WindScribe VPN Privilege EscalationThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
