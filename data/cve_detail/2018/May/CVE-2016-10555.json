{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10555", "Description": "Since \"algorithm\" isn't enforced in jwt.decode()in jwt-simple 0.3.0 and earlier, a malicious user could choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server. If the server is expecting RSA but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker wants.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10555", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nJwt-simple Project\u00bbJwt-simple\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.3.0cpe:2.3:a:jwt-simple_project:jwt-simple:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2023-10-22  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-05-25  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  6.73%  0.11%  -6.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-310", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/310/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hokaccha/node-jwt-simple/pull/14", "ref_desc": "Add a verify(token, algorithm, verificationKey) method as per this posting regarding vulnerabilities in jwt: https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/ \u00b7 IIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/", "ref_desc": "Critical vulnerabilities in JSON Web Token librariesBroken Link;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IwZyhj8jNpc-cWVq-5zWCAxdzO8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/87", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hokaccha/node-jwt-simple/pull/16", "ref_desc": "Add an algorithm parameter to the decode method by gregorypratt \u00b7 Pull Request #16 \u00b7 hokaccha/node-jwt-simple \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
