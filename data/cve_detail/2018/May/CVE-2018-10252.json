{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10252", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Actiontec WCB6200Q before 1.1.10.20a devices. The admin login session cookie is insecurely generated making admin session hijacking possible. When an admin logs in, a session cookie is generated using the time of day rounded to 10ms. Since the web server returns its current time of day in responses, it is possible to step backward through possible session values until a working one is found. Once a working session ID is found, an attacker then has admin control of the device and can add a secondary SSID to create a backdoor to the network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10252", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nActiontec\u00bbWcb6200q FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.1.10.20acpe:2.3:o:actiontec:wcb6200q_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Actiontec\u00bbWcb6200q\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://actiontecsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000432163-WCB6200Q-Firmware-Upgrade", "ref_desc": "WCB6200Q Firmware Upgrade \u2013 Actiontec SupportIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
