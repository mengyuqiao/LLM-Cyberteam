{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10532", "Description": "console-io is a module that allows users to implement a web console in their application. A malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute any command that the user who is running the console-io application 2.2.13 and earlier is able to run. This means that if console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to the system. This vulnerability exists because the console-io application does not configure socket.io to require authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via a websocket to send commands and receive the response.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10532", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nConsole-io Project\u00bbConsole-io\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.13cpe:2.3:a:console-io_project:console-io:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-22  0.43%  0.30%  -0.13 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.43%  -0.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/90", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
