{"CVE Code": "CVE-2014-10064", "Description": "The qs module before 1.0.0 does not have an option or default for specifying object depth and when parsing a string representing a deeply nested object will block the event loop for long periods of time. An attacker could leverage this to cause a temporary denial-of-service condition, for example, in a web application, other requests would not be processed while this blocking is occurring.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-10064", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nQs Project\u00bbQS\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:qs_project:qs:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-03-05  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/28", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
