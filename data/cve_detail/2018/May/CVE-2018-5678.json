{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5678", "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader before 9.1 and PhantomPDF before 9.1. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of specially crafted pdf files with embedded u3d images. Crafted data in the PDF file can trigger an overflow of a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-5674 and CVE-2018-5676.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5678", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFoxitsoftware\u00bbReaderVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.0.1.1049cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFoxitsoftware\u00bbPhantompdfVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.0.1.1049cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:phantompdf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.95% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.71%  1.95%  -0.75 \n 2  2024-05-03  2.75%  2.71%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-04-02  2.70%  2.75%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-10-15  3.03%  2.70%  -0.33 \n 5  2023-05-18  3.00%  3.03%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  4.10%  3.00%  -1.09 \n 7  2023-02-18  3.99%  4.10%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104300", "ref_desc": "Foxit Reader and PhantomPDF Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Hrmbrs1Q05ZVBKYaDlq0UKSFBWc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2018-0012/", "ref_desc": "Source InciteThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php", "ref_desc": "Security Bulletins | Foxit SoftwareVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jMnbASCwj0zoMu27sNpzmpvRmKs.html"}]}
