{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8010", "Description": "This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.3, 7.0.0 to 7.3.0 relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files (solrconfig.xml, schema.xml, managed-schema). In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar way. The vulnerability can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network. Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.4 or Solr 7.3.1 releases both of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade is complete, no other steps are required. Those releases only allow external entities and Xincludes that refer to local files / zookeeper resources below the Solr instance directory (using Solr's ResourceLoader); usage of absolute URLs is denied. Keep in mind, that external entities and XInclude are explicitly supported to better structure config files in large installations. Before Solr 6 this was no problem, as config files were not accessible through the APIs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8010", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSolrVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 6.6.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:solr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbSolrVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.3.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:solr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-09  0.10%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-05-15  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.09%  -1.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104239", "ref_desc": "Apache Solr CVE-2018-8010 XML External Entity Multiple Information Disclosure VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201805.mbox/%3C08a801d3f0f9%24df46d300%249dd47900%24%40apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] CVE-2018-8010: XXE vulnerability due to Apache Solr configset uploadMitigation;Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r204ba2a9ea750f38d789d2bb429cc0925ad6133deea7cbc3001d96b5@%3Csolr-user.lucene.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVEs (vulnerabilities) that apply to Solr 8.4.1 - Pony MailCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Zyl2RmoM6uvCo5KY-pWwwAf8yLM.html"}]}
