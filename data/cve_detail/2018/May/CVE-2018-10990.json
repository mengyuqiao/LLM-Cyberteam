{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10990", "Description": "On Arris Touchstone Telephony Gateway TG1682G 9.1.103J6 devices, a logout action does not immediately destroy all state on the device related to the validity of the \"credential\" cookie, which might make it easier for attackers to obtain access at a later time (e.g., \"at least for a few minutes\"). NOTE: there is no documentation stating that the web UI's logout feature was supposed to do anything beyond removing the cookie from one instance of a web browser; a client-side logout action is often not intended to address cases where a person has made a copy of a cookie outside of a browser.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10990", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCommscope\u00bbArris Tg1682g Firmware\u00bbVersion:9.1.103j6cpe:2.3:o:commscope:arris_tg1682g_firmware:9.1.103j6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Commscope\u00bbArris Tg1682g\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-08  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/@AkshaySharmaUS/comcast-arris-touchstone-gateway-devices-are-vulnerable-heres-the-disclosure-7d603aa9342c", "ref_desc": "Comcast Arris Touchstone Gateway Devices are vulnerable!
