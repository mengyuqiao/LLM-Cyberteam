{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9335", "Description": "A hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability was identified in Red Lion Controls Sixnet-Managed Industrial Switches running firmware Version 5.0.196 and Stride-Managed Ethernet Switches running firmware Version 5.0.190. Vulnerable versions of Stride-Managed Ethernet switches and Sixnet-Managed Industrial switches use hard-coded HTTP SSL/SSH keys for secure communication. Because these keys cannot be regenerated by users, all products use the same key. The attacker could disrupt communication or compromise the system. CVSS v3 base score: 10, CVSS vector string: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Red Lion Controls recommends updating to SLX firmware Version 5.3.174.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9335", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedlion\u00bbSixnet-managed Industrial Switches FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.0.196cpe:2.3:o:redlion:sixnet-managed_industrial_switches_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Redlion\u00bbSixnet-managed Industrial Switches\u00bbVersion:N/A\nRedlion\u00bbStride-managed Ethernet Switches FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.0.190cpe:2.3:o:redlion:stride-managed_ethernet_switches_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Redlion\u00bbStride-managed Ethernet Switches\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.15%  -0.14 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-09  0.29%  0.28%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.29%  -0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-17-054-02", "ref_desc": "Red Lion Controls Sixnet-Managed Industrial Switches, AutomationDirect STRIDE-Managed Ethernet Switches Vulnerability | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
