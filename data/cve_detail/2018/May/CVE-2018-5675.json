{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5675", "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader before 9.1 and PhantomPDF before 9.1. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of specially crafted pdf files with embedded u3d images. Crafted data in the PDF file can trigger an out-of-bounds write on a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5675", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFoxitsoftware\u00bbReaderVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.0.1.1049cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFoxitsoftware\u00bbPhantompdfVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.0.1.1049cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:phantompdf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.63%  1.17%  -0.46 \n 2  2024-05-03  1.66%  1.63%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-04-02  1.62%  1.66%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-10-15  1.82%  1.62%  -0.20 \n 5  2023-05-18  1.80%  1.82%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  4.10%  1.80%  -2.30 \n 7  2023-02-18  3.99%  4.10%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2018-0013/", "ref_desc": "Source InciteThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104300", "ref_desc": "Foxit Reader and PhantomPDF Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Hrmbrs1Q05ZVBKYaDlq0UKSFBWc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php", "ref_desc": "Security Bulletins | Foxit SoftwareVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jMnbASCwj0zoMu27sNpzmpvRmKs.html"}]}
