{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10531", "Description": "marked is an application that is meant to parse and compile markdown. Due to the way that marked 0.3.5 and earlier parses input, specifically HTML entities, it's possible to bypass marked's content injection protection (`sanitize: true`) to inject a `javascript:` URL. This flaw exists because `&#xNNanything;` gets parsed to what it could and leaves the rest behind, resulting in just `anything;` being left.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10531", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMarked Project\u00bbMarked\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.3.5cpe:2.3:a:marked_project:marked:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-01-18  0.12%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.17%  0.12%  -0.05 \n 4  2023-05-25  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/chjj/marked/pull/592", "ref_desc": "XSS with HTML entities by matt- \u00b7 Pull Request #592 \u00b7 markedjs/marked \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/chjj/marked/pull/592/commits/2cff85979be8e7a026a9aca35542c470cf5da523", "ref_desc": "XSS with HTML entities by matt- \u00b7 Pull Request #592 \u00b7 markedjs/marked \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/101", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
