{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10645", "Description": "Golden Frog VyprVPN 2.12.1.8015 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability through the \"VyprVPN\" service. This service establishes a NetNamedPipe endpoint that allows applications to connect and call publicly exposed methods. The \"SetProperty\" method allows an attacker to configure the \"AdditionalOpenVpnParameters\" property and control the OpenVPN command line. Using the OpenVPN \"plugin\" parameter, an attacker may specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user. This attack may be conducted using \"VyprVPN Free\" account credentials and the VyprVPN Desktop Client.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10645", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGoldenfrog\u00bbVyprvpn\u00bbVersion:2.12.1.8015ForWindowscpe:2.3:a:goldenfrog:vyprvpn:2.12.1.8015:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.04%  -1.09 \n 2  2023-01-27  1.04%  1.14%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/VerSprite/research/blob/master/advisories/VS-2018-025.md", "ref_desc": "research/VS-2018-025.md at master \u00b7 VerSprite/research \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
