{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10832", "Description": "ModbusPal 1.6b is vulnerable to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. Projects are saved as .xmpp files and automations can be exported as .xmpa files, both XML-based, which are vulnerable to XXE injection. Sending a crafted .xmpp or .xmpa file to a user, when opened/imported in ModbusPal, will return the contents of any local files to a remote attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10832", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nModbuspal Project\u00bbModbuspal\u00bbVersion:1.6UpdateBcpe:2.3:a:modbuspal_project:modbuspal:1.6:b:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.17%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-14  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-26  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-04-20  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-03-20  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-10-02  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-04-02  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  2.81%  0.08%  -2.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44607/", "ref_desc": "ModbusPal 1.6b - XML External Entity InjectionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/147573/ModbusPal-1.6b-XML-External-Entity-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "ModbusPal 1.6b XML External Entity Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
