{"CVE Code": "CVE-2015-9236", "Description": "Hapi versions less than 11.0.0 implement CORS incorrectly and allowed for configurations that at best returned inconsistent headers and at worst allowed cross-origin activities that were expected to be forbidden. If the connection has CORS enabled but one route has it off, and the route is not GET, the OPTIONS prefetch request will return the default CORS headers and then the actual request will go through and return no CORS headers. This defeats the purpose of turning CORS on the route.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-9236", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nHapijs\u00bbHapi\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 11.0.0cpe:2.3:a:hapijs:hapi:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-08  0.20%  0.11%  -0.09 \n 2  2023-05-25  0.20%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.11%  0.20%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/2850", "ref_desc": "11.0.0 Release Notes \u00b7 Issue #2850 \u00b7 hapijs/hapi \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/45", "ref_desc": "npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/2840", "ref_desc": "CORS route-specific override can conflict with connection defaults \u00b7 Issue #2840 \u00b7 hapijs/hapi \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
