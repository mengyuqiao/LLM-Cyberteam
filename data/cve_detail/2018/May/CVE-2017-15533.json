All affected SSLV versions act as weak oracles according the oracle classification used in the ROBOT research paper. A remote attacker, who has captured a pre-recorded SSL session inspected by SSLV, can establish multiple millions of crafted SSL connections to the target and obtain the session keys required to decrypt the pre-recorded SSL session.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15533", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBroadcom\u00bbSsl Visibility Appliance\u00bbVersion:3.10cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBroadcom\u00bbSsl Visibility Appliance\u00bbVersion:3.12cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBroadcom\u00bbSsl Visibility Appliance\u00bbVersion:3.8.4fccpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.8.4fc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBroadcom\u00bbSsl Visibility Appliance\u00bbVersion:3.11cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.28%  +0.11 \n 2  2023-10-08  0.20%  0.17%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.20%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.symantec.com/security-center/network-protection-security-advisories/SA160", "ref_desc": "SA160: Return of the Bleichenbacher Oracle Threat (ROBOT)Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/c2RK8vRmp7lYwLkb0W819pnTHkg.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104163", "ref_desc": "Symantec SSLV CVE-2017-15533 Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
