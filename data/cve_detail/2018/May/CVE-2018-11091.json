{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11091", "Description": "An issue was discovered in MyBiz MyProcureNet 5.0.0. A malicious file can be uploaded to the webserver by an attacker. It is possible for an attacker to upload a script to issue operating system commands. This vulnerability occurs because an attacker is able to adjust the \"HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions\" parameter and add arbitrary extensions to the whitelist during the upload. For instance, if the extension .asp is added to the \"HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions\" parameter, the server accepts \"secctest.asp\" as a legitimate file. Hence malicious files can be uploaded in order to execute arbitrary commands to take over the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11091", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMybiz\u00bbMyprocurenet\u00bbVersion:5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:mybiz:myprocurenet:5.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-05  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.26%  0.17%  -0.10 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.14%  0.26%  +0.13 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/arbitrary-file-upload-cross-site-scripting-in-mybiz-myprocurenet/", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Upload & Cross-site scripting in MyBiz MyProcureNet \u2013 SEC ConsultThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/d-ZPNwkrpz5SBisWLqLB3PV4Ej0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Nov/16", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-19:26.mcuCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EesUrTqudRu4QvmRd8EMBPX2dEM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-19:26.mcu.asc", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HgSKszWAKRsgNmkvHvd6fmjTMqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155281/FreeBSD-Security-Advisory-FreeBSD-SA-19-26.mcu.html", "ref_desc": "FreeBSD Security Advisory - FreeBSD-SA-19:26.mcu \u2248 Packet StormCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RXrPg87Kz5fkt92ru_5i12kvzAM.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/May/32", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: SEC Consult SA-20180514-0 :: Arbitrary File Upload & Cross-site scripting in MyBiz MyProcureNetMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TPtGqZ9-neNz96IG-vW4uAInWsU.html"}]}
