{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7933", "Description": "Huawei home gateway products HiRouter-CD20 and WS5200 with the versions before HiRouter-CD20-10 1.9.6 and the versions before WS5200-10 1.9.6 have a path traversal vulnerability. Due to the lack of validation while these home gateway products install APK plugins, an attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious APK plugin, and plugin can overwrite arbitrary file of devices. Successful exploit may result in arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7933", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nHuawei\u00bbHirouter-cd20 FirmwareVersions  before (<) hirouter-cd20-10_1.9.6cpe:2.3:o:huawei:hirouter-cd20_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Huawei\u00bbHirouter-cd20\u00bbVersion:N/A\nHuawei\u00bbWs5200 FirmwareVersions  before (<) ws5200-10_1.9.6cpe:2.3:o:huawei:ws5200_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Huawei\u00bbWs5200\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.07%  -1.06 \n 2  2023-02-04  1.04%  1.14%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-advisories/huawei-sa-20180502-01-gateway-en", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory - Path Traversal Vulnerability in Some Huawei Home Gateway ProductsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
