{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11567", "Description": "Prior to 2018-04-27, the reprompt feature in Amazon Echo devices could be misused by a custom Alexa skill. The reprompt feature is designed so that if Alexa does not receive an input within 8 seconds, the device can speak a reprompt, then wait an additional 8 seconds for input; if the user still does not respond, the microphone is then turned off. The vulnerability involves empty output-speech reprompts, custom wildcard (\"gibberish\") input slots, and logging of detected speech. If a maliciously designed skill is installed, an attacker could obtain transcripts of speech not intended for Alexa to process, but simply spoken within the device's hearing range. NOTE: The vendor states \"Customer trust is important to us and we take security and privacy seriously. We have put mitigations in place for detecting this type of skill behavior and reject or suppress those skills when we do. Customers do not need to take any action for these mitigations to work.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11567", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbEcho Show FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2018-04-27cpe:2.3:o:amazon:echo_show_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Amazon\u00bbEcho Show\u00bbVersion:N/A\nAmazon\u00bbEcho Plus FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2018-04-27cpe:2.3:o:amazon:echo_plus_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Amazon\u00bbEcho Plus\u00bbVersion:N/A\nAmazon\u00bbEcho Dot FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2018-04-27cpe:2.3:o:amazon:echo_dot_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Amazon\u00bbEcho Dot\u00bbVersion:N/A\nAmazon\u00bbEcho Spot FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2018-04-27cpe:2.3:o:amazon:echo_spot_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Amazon\u00bbEcho Spot\u00bbVersion:N/A\nAmazon\u00bbEcho FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2018-04-27cpe:2.3:o:amazon:echo_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Amazon\u00bbEcho\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-05-24  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.10%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/amazon-alexa-bug-let-hackers-104609600.html", "ref_desc": "Amazon fixes Alexa bug that let Echo keep listeningPress/Media Coverage;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-echo-alexa-skill-spying/", "ref_desc": "Turning an Amazon Echo Into a Spy Device Only Took Some Clever Coding | WIREDPress/Media Coverage;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.checkmarx.com/2018/04/25/eavesdropping-with-amazon-alexa/", "ref_desc": "Eavesdropping with Amazon AlexaThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://info.checkmarx.com/hubfs/Amazon_Echo_Research.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
