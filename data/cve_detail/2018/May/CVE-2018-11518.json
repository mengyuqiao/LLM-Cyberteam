{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11518", "Description": "A vulnerability allows a phreaking attack on HCL legacy IVR systems that do not use VoIP. These IVR systems rely on various frequencies of audio signals; based on the frequency, certain commands and functions are processed. Since these frequencies are accepted within a phone call, an attacker can record these frequencies and use them for service activations. This is a request-forgery issue when the required series of DTMF signals for a service activation is predictable (e.g., the IVR system does not speak a nonce to the caller). In this case, the IVR system accepts an activation request from a less-secure channel (any loudspeaker in the caller's physical environment) without verifying that the request was intended (it matches a nonce sent over a more-secure channel to the caller's earpiece).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11518", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nHcltech\u00bbLegacy Ivr Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:hcltech:legacy_ivr_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Hcltech\u00bbLegacy Ivr\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-21  0.32%  0.36%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-05-24  0.37%  0.32%  -0.06 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.37%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://virgil-cj.blogspot.com/2018/05/0day-legacy-ivr-lets-phreak.html", "ref_desc": "A Virgil's Guide to Pentest: 0day - Legacy IVR - Let's PhreakThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://datarift.blogspot.com/2018/05/CVE-2018-11518-abusing-ivr-systems.html", "ref_desc": "Abusing IVR Systems - Legacy Telecom [CVE-2018-11518] ~ inputzeroThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/mishradhiraj_/status/1001664204485652482", "ref_desc": "Dhiraj on Twitter: \"Yes there is no boundry crossing here and it does follow the flow but the flow is controlled by someone else not the user who has initiated the call.
