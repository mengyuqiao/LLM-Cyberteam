{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12891", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. Certain PV MMU operations may take a long time to process. For that reason Xen explicitly checks for the need to preempt the current vCPU at certain points. A few rarely taken code paths did bypass such checks. By suitably enforcing the conditions through its own page table contents, a malicious guest may cause such bypasses to be used for an unbounded number of iterations. A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Specifically, it may prevent use of a physical CPU for an indeterminate period of time. All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 3.3 and earlier are vulnerable to an even wider class of attacks, due to them lacking preemption checks altogether in the affected code paths. Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected. Only multi-vCPU x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM or PVH guests as well as x86 single-vCPU PV ones cannot leverage the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12891", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXEN\u00bbXENVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.10.1cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.05%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104570", "ref_desc": "Xen CVE-2018-12891 Local Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX235748", "ref_desc": "Citrix XenServer Multiple Security UpdatesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fFmtJ3ykz36VNiUpMyJtBOYf6iE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4236", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4236-1 xenThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HPGrbLuFu0KP0dLLeiWNKCGW-3I.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041201", "ref_desc": "Xen PV MMU Preemption Lets Local Users on a Guest System Cause Denial of Service Conditions on the Host System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/11/msg00013.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1577-1] xen security updateIssue Tracking;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Iu4MiO0qjgho7uKPBPe3fqq_oXM.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-264.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-264 - Xen Security AdvisoriesPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201810-06", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201810-06) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NmimDMjWeZ7wFEugsNuVNM0lg-s.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/06/27/10", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 264 (CVE-2018-12891) - preemption checks bypassed in x86 PV MM handlingMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
