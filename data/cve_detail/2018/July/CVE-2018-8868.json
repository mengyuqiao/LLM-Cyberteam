{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8868", "Description": "Medtronic MyCareLink Patient Monitor, 24950 MyCareLink Monitor, all versions, and 24952 MyCareLink Monitor, all versions, contains debug code meant to test the functionality of the monitor's communication interfaces, including the interface between the monitor and implantable cardiac device. An attacker with physical access to the device can apply the other vulnerabilities within this advisory to access this debug functionality. This debug functionality provides the ability to read and write arbitrary memory values to implantable cardiac devices via inductive or short range wireless protocols. An attacker with close physical proximity to a target implantable cardiac device can use this debug functionality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8868", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMedtronic\u00bb24950 Mycarelink Monitor Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:medtronic:24950_mycarelink_monitor_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Medtronic\u00bb24950 Mycarelink Monitor\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMedtronic\u00bb24952 Mycarelink Monitor Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:medtronic:24952_mycarelink_monitor_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Medtronic\u00bb24952 Mycarelink Monitor\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.37%  +0.30 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-749 Exposed Dangerous Method or Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/749/Exposed-Dangerous-Method-or-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-18-179-01", "ref_desc": "Medtronic MyCareLink Patient Monitor | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Fz8Z7T4Qd47RuaEVgC4Oqdq4pWA.html"}]}
