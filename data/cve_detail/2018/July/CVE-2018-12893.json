{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12893", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. One of the fixes in XSA-260 added some safety checks to help prevent Xen livelocking with debug exceptions. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, at least one of these safety checks can be triggered by a guest. A malicious PV guest can crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service. All Xen systems which have applied the XSA-260 fix are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available to unprivileged users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12893", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXEN\u00bbXENx86Versions  up to, including, (<=) 4.10.0cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.28%  0.05%  -1.24 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX235748", "ref_desc": "Citrix XenServer Multiple Security UpdatesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fFmtJ3ykz36VNiUpMyJtBOYf6iE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4236", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4236-1 xenThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HPGrbLuFu0KP0dLLeiWNKCGW-3I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/11/msg00013.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1577-1] xen security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Iu4MiO0qjgho7uKPBPe3fqq_oXM.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-265.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-265 - Xen Security AdvisoriesMitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201810-06", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201810-06) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NmimDMjWeZ7wFEugsNuVNM0lg-s.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104572", "ref_desc": "Xen CVE-2018-12893 Local Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/06/27/11", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 265 (CVE-2018-12893) - x86: #DB exception safety check can be triggered by a guestMitigation;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041202", "ref_desc": "Xen Debug Exception Trigger Lets Local Users on a Guest System Cause Denial of Service Conditions on the Host System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1590979", "ref_desc": "1590979 \u2013 (CVE-2018-12893) CVE-2018-12893 xen: x86 DB exception safety check can be triggered by a guest (XSA-265)Mitigation;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
