{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14085", "Description": "An issue was discovered in a smart contract implementation for UserWallet 0x0a7bca9FB7AfF26c6ED8029BB6f0F5D291587c42, an Ethereum token. First, suppose that the owner adds the evil contract address to his sweepers. The evil contract looks like this: contract Exploit { uint public start; function sweep(address _token, uint _amount) returns (bool) { start = 0x123456789; return true;} }. Then, when one calls the function sweep() in the UserWallet contract, it will change the sweeperList to 0X123456789.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14085", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nUserwallet Project\u00bbUserwallet\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:userwallet_project:userwallet:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hellowuzekai/blockchains/blob/master/delegatecall.md", "ref_desc": "blockchains/delegatecall.md at master \u00b7 hellowuzekai/blockchains \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
