{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14089", "Description": "An issue was discovered in a smart contract implementation for Virgo_ZodiacToken, an Ethereum token. In this contract, 'bool sufficientAllowance = allowance <= _value' will cause an arbitrary transfer in the function transferFrom because '<=' is used instead of '>=' (which was intended). An attacker can transfer from any address to his address, and does not need to meet the 'allowance > value' condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14089", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nVirgo Zodiactoken Project\u00bbVirgo Zodiactoken\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:virgo_zodiactoken_project:virgo_zodiactoken:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hellowuzekai/blockchains/blob/master/transferFrom.md", "ref_desc": "blockchains/transferFrom.md at master \u00b7 hellowuzekai/blockchains \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
