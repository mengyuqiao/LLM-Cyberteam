{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11047", "Description": "Cloud Foundry UAA, versions 4.19 prior to 4.19.2 and 4.12 prior to 4.12.4 and 4.10 prior to 4.10.2 and 4.7 prior to 4.7.6 and 4.5 prior to 4.5.7, incorrectly authorizes requests to admin endpoints by accepting a valid refresh token in lieu of an access token. Refresh tokens by design have a longer expiration time than access tokens, allowing the possessor of a refresh token to authenticate longer than expected. This affects the administrative endpoints of the UAA. i.e. /Users, /Groups, etc. However, if the user has been deleted or had groups removed, or the client was deleted, the refresh token will no longer be valid.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11047", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPivotal Software\u00bbCloud Foundry UaaVersions  from including (>=) 4.5.0andbefore (<) 4.5.7cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:cloud_foundry_uaa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbCloud Foundry UaaVersions  from including (>=) 4.12.0andbefore (<) 4.12.4cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:cloud_foundry_uaa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbCloud Foundry UaaVersions  from including (>=) 4.7.0andbefore (<) 4.7.6cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:cloud_foundry_uaa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbCloud Foundry UaaVersions  from including (>=) 4.10.0andbefore (<) 4.10.2cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:cloud_foundry_uaa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbCloud Foundry UaaVersions  from including (>=) 4.19.0andbefore (<) 4.19.2cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:cloud_foundry_uaa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2018-11047/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-11047: UAA accepts refresh token as access token on admin endpoints | Cloud FoundryMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
