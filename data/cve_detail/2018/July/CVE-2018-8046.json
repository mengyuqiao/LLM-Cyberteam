{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8046", "Description": "The getTip() method of Action Columns of Sencha Ext JS 4 to 6 before 6.6.0 is vulnerable to XSS attacks, even when passed HTML-escaped data. This framework brings no built-in XSS protection, so the developer has to ensure that data is correctly sanitized. However, the getTip() method of Action Columns takes HTML-escaped data and un-escapes it. If the tooltip contains user-controlled data, an attacker could exploit this to create a cross-site scripting attack, even when developers took precautions and escaped data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8046", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSencha\u00bbExt JsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 6.6.0cpe:2.3:a:sencha:ext_js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://examples.sencha.com/extjs/6.6.0/release-notes.html", "ref_desc": "404 Not FoundRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Jul/8", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: XSS in Sencha Ext JS 4 to 6Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
