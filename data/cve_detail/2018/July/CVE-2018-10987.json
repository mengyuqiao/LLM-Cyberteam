{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10987", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Dongguan Diqee Diqee360 devices. The affected vacuum cleaner suffers from an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability. An authenticated attacker can send a specially crafted UDP packet, and execute commands on the vacuum cleaner as root. The bug is in the function REQUEST_SET_WIFIPASSWD (UDP command 153). A crafted UDP packet runs \"/mnt/skyeye/mode_switch.sh %s\" with an attacker controlling the %s variable. In some cases, authentication can be achieved with the default password of 888888 for the admin account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10987", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDiqee\u00bbDiqee360 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:diqee:diqee360_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Diqee\u00bbDiqee360\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-08-30  0.13%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-05-14  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.14%  -1.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/neolead/10b27c5c04bca84a5515783ca6f2ecb4#file-cve-2018-10987-txt", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-10987 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
