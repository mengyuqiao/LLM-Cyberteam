{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10903", "Description": "A flaw was found in python-cryptography versions between >=1.9.0 and <2.3. The finalize_with_tag API did not enforce a minimum tag length. If a user did not validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag an attacker could craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1 byte) such that they would have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check. GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10903", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenstack\u00bbVersion:13cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openstack:13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:18.04    LTSEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:18.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nCryptography\u00bbPython-cryptographyVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.0andbefore (<) 2.3cpe:2.3:a:cryptography:python-cryptography:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-24  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.14%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-10903", "ref_desc": "1602931 \u2013 (CVE-2018-10903) CVE-2018-10903 python-cryptography: GCM tag forgery via truncated tag in finalize_with_tag APIIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3720-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-3720-1: python-cryptography vulnerability | Ubuntu security noticesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3600", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:3600 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/4342/commits/688e0f673bfbf43fa898994326c6877f00ab19ef", "ref_desc": "disallow implicit tag truncation with finalize_with_tag by reaperhulk \u00b7 Pull Request #4342 \u00b7 pyca/cryptography \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
