{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14568", "Description": "Suricata before 4.0.5 stops TCP stream inspection upon a TCP RST from a server. This allows detection bypass because Windows TCP clients proceed with normal processing of TCP data that arrives shortly after an RST (i.e., they act as if the RST had not yet been received).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14568", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSuricata-ids\u00bbSuricataVersions  before (<) 4.0.5cpe:2.3:a:suricata-ids:suricata:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-07  0.26%  0.18%  -0.08 \n 3  2024-03-11  0.29%  0.26%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-12-14  0.24%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-07-17  0.26%  0.24%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.27%  0.26%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.27%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/2501", "ref_desc": "Bug #2501: Suricata stops inspecting TCP stream if a TCP RST was met - Suricata - Open Information Security FoundationExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://suricata-ids.org/2018/07/18/suricata-4-0-5-available/", "ref_desc": "Suricata 4.0.5 available! | SuricataVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HEJPzgBz3Sr6FkvB8xmeen0Wa7U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/pull/3428/commits/843d0b7a10bb45627f94764a6c5d468a24143345", "ref_desc": "Next/20180718/v5 by victorjulien \u00b7 Pull Request #3428 \u00b7 OISF/suricata \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kirillwow/ids_bypass", "ref_desc": "GitHub - kirillwow/ids_bypass: IDS Bypass tricksExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XI1sijamk5IEN7hFOPCAzqdO3ak.html"}]}
