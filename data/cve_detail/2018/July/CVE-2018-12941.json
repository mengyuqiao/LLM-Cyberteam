{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12941", "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in SeedDMS (formerly LetoDMS and MyDMS) before 5.1.8 by adding a system command at the end of the \"cacheDir\" path and following usage of the \"Clear Cache\" functionality. This allows an authenticated attacker, with permission to the Settings functionality, to inject arbitrary system commands within the application by manipulating the \"Cache directory\" path. An attacker can use it to perform malicious tasks such as to extract, change, or delete sensitive information or run system commands on the underlying operating system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12941", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSeeddms\u00bbSeeddmsVersions  before (<) 5.1.8cpe:2.3:a:seeddms:seeddms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.28%  0.28%  0.00 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.30%  0.28%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-06-09  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-22  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-16  0.34%  0.26%  -0.08 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.34%  -1.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.contextis.com/resources/advisories/cve-2018-12941", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-12941 | Context Information Security UKThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sourceforge.net/p/seeddms/code/ci/seeddms-5.1.x/tree/CHANGELOG", "ref_desc": "seeddms / Code / [4767bf] /CHANGELOGThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IG7xPghFg7dy_bnRU0ER9yeGACI.html"}]}
