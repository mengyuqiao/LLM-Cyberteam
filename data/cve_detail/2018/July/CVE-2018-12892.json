{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12892", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen 4.7 through 4.10.x. libxl fails to pass the readonly flag to qemu when setting up a SCSI disk, due to what was probably an erroneous merge conflict resolution. Malicious guest administrators or (in some situations) users may be able to write to supposedly read-only disk images. Only emulated SCSI disks (specified as \"sd\" in the libxl disk configuration, or an equivalent) are affected. IDE disks (\"hd\") are not affected (because attempts to make them readonly are rejected). Additionally, CDROM devices (that is, devices specified to be presented to the guest as CDROMs, regardless of the nature of the backing storage on the host) are not affected; they are always read only. Only systems using qemu-xen (rather than qemu-xen-traditional) as the device model version are vulnerable. Only systems using libxl or libxl-based toolstacks are vulnerable. (This includes xl, and libvirt with the libxl driver.) The vulnerability is present in Xen versions 4.7 and later. (In earlier versions, provided that the patch for XSA-142 has been applied, attempts to create read only disks are rejected.) If the host and guest together usually support PVHVM, the issue is exploitable only if the malicious guest administrator has control of the guest kernel or guest kernel command line.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12892", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXEN\u00bbXENVersions  from including (>=) 4.7.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.10.1cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.74%  0.63%  -0.11 \n 2  2024-01-26  1.05%  0.74%  -0.31 \n 3  2024-01-02  1.48%  1.05%  -0.43 \n 4  2023-11-23  1.84%  1.48%  -0.36 \n 5  2023-06-26  1.33%  1.84%  +0.51 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.03%  1.33%  +0.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104571", "ref_desc": "Xen CVE-2018-12892 Local Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041203", "ref_desc": "Xen Lets Local Administrative Users on a Guest System Write to Read-Only Disks in Certain Cases - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4236", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4236-1 xenThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HPGrbLuFu0KP0dLLeiWNKCGW-3I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201810-06", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201810-06) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NmimDMjWeZ7wFEugsNuVNM0lg-s.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/06/27/12", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 266 (CVE-2018-12892) - libxl fails to honour readonly flag on HVM emulated SCSI disksMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-266.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-266 - Xen Security AdvisoriesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
