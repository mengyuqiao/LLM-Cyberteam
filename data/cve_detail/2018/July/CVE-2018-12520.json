{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12520", "Description": "An issue was discovered in ntopng 3.4 before 3.4.180617. The PRNG involved in the generation of session IDs is not seeded at program startup. This results in deterministic session IDs being allocated for active user sessions. An attacker with foreknowledge of the operating system and standard library in use by the host running the service and the username of the user whose session they're targeting can abuse the deterministic random number generation in order to hijack the user's session, thus escalating their access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12520", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNtop\u00bbNtopngVersions  from including (>=) 3.4andbefore (<) 3.4.180617cpe:2.3:a:ntop:ntopng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.16%  2.54%  -2.62 \n 2  2024-04-19  6.48%  5.16%  -1.32 \n 3  2024-02-10  2.85%  6.48%  +3.63 \n 4  2023-12-17  3.64%  2.85%  -0.78 \n 5  2023-11-26  5.14%  3.64%  -1.50 \n 6  2023-10-15  6.25%  5.14%  -1.11 \n 7  2023-08-22  8.75%  6.25%  -2.50 \n 8  2023-08-03  7.99%  8.75%  +0.76 \n 9  2023-07-17  10.03%  7.99%  -2.04 \n 10  2023-07-08  10.57%  10.03%  -0.54 \n 11  2023-06-29  10.55%  10.57%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-06-14  15.79%  10.55%  -5.23 \n 13  2023-05-27  25.39%  15.79%  -9.60 \n 14  2023-05-08  24.32%  25.39%  +1.06 \n 15  2023-04-25  25.80%  24.32%  -1.48 \n 16  2023-03-07  8.38%  25.80%  +17.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-335 Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/335/Incorrect-Usage-of-Seeds-in-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ntop/ntopng/commit/30610bda60cbfc058f90a1c0a17d0e8f4516221a", "ref_desc": "Added code to randomize values returned by rand() \u00b7 ntop/ntopng@30610bd \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44973/", "ref_desc": "ntop-ng < 3.4.180617 - Authentication BypassExploit;VDB Entry;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/Psychotropos/3e8c047cada9b1fb716e6a014a428b7f", "ref_desc": "ntopng_cve_poc.py \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Jul/14", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: ntop-ng < 3.4.180617 - Authentication bypass / session hijackingExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
