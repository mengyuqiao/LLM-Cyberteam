{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14387", "Description": "An issue was discovered in WonderCMS before 2.5.2. An attacker can create a new session on a web application and record the associated session identifier. The attacker then causes the victim to authenticate against the server using the same session identifier. The attacker can access the user's account through the active session. The Session Fixation attack fixes a session on the victim's browser, so the attack starts before the user logs in.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14387", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWondercms\u00bbWondercmsVersions  before (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:wondercms:wondercms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.34%  +0.17 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.21%  0.17%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.18%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.26%  0.17%  -0.09 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.22%  0.26%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wondercms.com/whatsnew", "ref_desc": "WonderCMS - one of the smallest and lightest flat file CMS - What's newVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fKJnLNADSv1l5grpQlIjpgM0S6U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/robiso/wondercms/issues/64", "ref_desc": "Session Fixation \u00b7 Issue #64 \u00b7 robiso/wondercms \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
