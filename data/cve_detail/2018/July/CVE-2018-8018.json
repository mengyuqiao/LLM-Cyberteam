{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8018", "Description": "In Apache Ignite before 2.4.8 and 2.5.x before 2.5.3, the serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization endpoint.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8018", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbIgniteVersions  before (<) 2.4.8cpe:2.3:a:apache:ignite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbIgniteVersions  after (>) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:ignite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.64%  4.41%  +2.77 \n 2  2024-05-03  2.25%  1.64%  -0.62 \n 3  2024-01-19  2.34%  2.25%  -0.08 \n 4  2023-12-10  3.51%  2.34%  -1.17 \n 5  2023-11-08  3.00%  3.51%  +0.51 \n 6  2023-10-11  4.19%  3.00%  -1.19 \n 7  2023-08-17  4.28%  4.19%  -0.10 \n 8  2023-05-08  3.15%  4.28%  +1.13 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  3.15%  +2.20 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3768", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:3768 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/efIYDkp1XOJqTcMGESS_Du5b0Z4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104911", "ref_desc": "Apache Ignite CVE-2018-8018 Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e0fdf53114a321142ecfa5cfa17658090f0b4e1677de431e329b37ab@%3Cdev.ignite.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2018-8018] Possible Execution of Arbitrary Code via Apache Ignite GridClientJdkMarshaller - Pony MailMailing List;VDB Entry;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
