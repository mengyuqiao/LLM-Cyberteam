{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0468", "Description": "A vulnerability in the configuration of a local database installed as part of the Cisco Energy Management Suite (CEMS) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access and alter confidential data. The vulnerability is due to the installation of the PostgreSQL database with unchanged default access credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the machine where CEMS is installed and establishing a local connection to the database. The fix for this vulnerability randomizes the database access password in new installations; however, the fix will not change the password for existing installations. Users are required to manually change the password, as documented in the Workarounds section of this advisory. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0468", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnergy Management Suite\u00bbVersion:5.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:energy_management_suite:5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-42", "ref_desc": "[R1] Cisco Energy Management Suite Default PostgreSQL Credentials - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeBroken Link;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106124", "ref_desc": "Cisco Energy Management Suite CVE-2018-0468 Access Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181204-ems-sql-passwrd", "ref_desc": "Cisco Energy Management Suite Default PostgreSQL Password VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
