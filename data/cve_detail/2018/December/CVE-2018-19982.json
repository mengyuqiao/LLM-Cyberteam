{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-19982", "Description": "An issue was discovered on KT MC01507L Z-Wave S0 devices. It occurs because HPKP is not implemented. The communication architecture is APP > Server > Controller (HUB) > Node (products which are controlled by HUB). The prerequisite is that the attacker is on the same network as the target HUB, and can use IP Changer to change destination IP addresses (of all packets whose destination IP address is Server) to a proxy-server IP address. This allows sniffing of cleartext between Server and Controller. The cleartext command data is transmitted to Controller using the proxy server's fake certificate, and it is able to control each Node of the HUB. Also, by operating HUB in Z-Wave Pairing Mode, it is possible to obtain the Z-Wave network key.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19982", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPowermanager\u00bbKt Mc01507l Z-wave S0 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:powermanager:kt_mc01507l_z-wave_s0_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Powermanager\u00bbKt Mc01507l Z-wave S0\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/min1233/CVE/blob/master/1", "ref_desc": "CVE/1 at master \u00b7 min1233/CVE \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
