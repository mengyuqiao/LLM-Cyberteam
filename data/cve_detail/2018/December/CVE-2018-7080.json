{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7080", "Description": "A vulnerability exists in the firmware of embedded BLE radios that are part of some Aruba Access points. An attacker who is able to exploit the vulnerability could install new, potentially malicious firmware into the AP's BLE radio and could then gain access to the AP's console port. This vulnerability is applicable only if the BLE radio has been enabled in affected access points. The BLE radio is disabled by default. Note - Aruba products are NOT affected by a similar vulnerability being tracked as CVE-2018-16986.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7080", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArubanetworks\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0.0andbefore (<) 8.2.2.2cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArubanetworks\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 8.3.0.0andbefore (<) 8.3.0.4cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArubanetworks\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 6.5.3.0andbefore (<) 6.5.3.9cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArubanetworks\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.4.0andbefore (<) 6.4.4.20cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArubanetworks\u00bbArubaosVersions  from including (>=) 6.5.4.0andbefore (<) 6.5.4.9cpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:arubaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArubanetworks\u00bb203rp Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:203rp_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Arubanetworks\u00bb203rp\u00bbVersion:N/A\nArubanetworks\u00bb203r Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:203r_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Arubanetworks\u00bb203r\u00bbVersion:N/A\nArubanetworks\u00bbAp-300 Series Access Points Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:ap-300_series_access_points_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Arubanetworks\u00bbAp-300 Series Access Points\u00bbVersion:N/A\nArubanetworks\u00bbAp-300 Series Instant Access Points Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:arubanetworks:ap-300_series_instant_access_points_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Arubanetworks\u00bbAp-300 Series Instant Access Points\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-29  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2018-006.txt", "ref_desc": "Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105814", "ref_desc": "Texas Instruments Bluetooth Low Energy Chips CVE-2018-7080 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
