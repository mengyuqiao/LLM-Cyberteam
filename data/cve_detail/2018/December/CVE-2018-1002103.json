{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1002103", "Description": "In Minikube versions 0.3.0-0.29.0, minikube exposes the Kubernetes Dashboard listening on the VM IP at port 30000. In VM environments where the IP is easy to predict, the attacker can use DNS rebinding to indirectly make requests to the Kubernetes Dashboard, create a new Kubernetes Deployment running arbitrary code. If minikube mount is in use, the attacker could also directly access the host filesystem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1002103", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nKubernetes\u00bbMinikubeVersions  from including (>=) 0.3.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.29.0cpe:2.3:a:kubernetes:minikube:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/3208", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-1002103: Dashboard vulnerable to DNS rebinding attack \u00b7 Issue #3208 \u00b7 kubernetes/minikube \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
