{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15005", "Description": "The ZTE ZMAX Champ Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.zte.zdm.sdm (versionCode=31, versionName=V5.0.3) that contains an exported broadcast receiver app component named com.zte.zdm.VdmcBroadcastReceiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate a factory reset. In addition, the app initiating the factory reset does not require any permissions. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of a pre-installed platform app.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15005", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZteusa\u00bbZte Zmax Champ Firmware\u00bbVersion:5.0.3cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_zmax_champ_firmware:5.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Zteusa\u00bbZte Zmax Champ\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-09  0.12%  0.08%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-12-22  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106361", "ref_desc": "ZTE ZMAX Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7tcCvfat-FNDY_JQ1wdL8yArqPY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/di55zHOFoUoDcUbFdhEyps0WwL8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/", "ref_desc": "Kryptowire Provides Details on DEFCON 2018 Presentation: Vulnerable Out of the Box - An Evaluation of Android Carrier Devices - KryptowireThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ePdPR6-heyAn2FjJ19P0pu_CWlA.html"}]}
