{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18556", "Description": "A privilege escalation issue was discovered in VyOS 1.1.8. The default configuration also allows operator users to execute the pppd binary with elevated (sudo) permissions. Certain input parameters are not properly validated. A malicious operator user can run the binary with elevated permissions and leverage its improper input validation condition to spawn an attacker-controlled shell with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18556", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nVyos\u00bbVyos\u00bbVersion:1.1.8cpe:2.3:o:vyos:vyos:1.1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.25%  2.79%  +0.54 \n 2  2024-10-26  1.83%  2.25%  +0.41 \n 3  2024-10-01  1.62%  1.83%  +0.22 \n 4  2024-09-01  1.80%  1.62%  -0.19 \n 5  2024-07-12  2.54%  1.80%  -0.73 \n 6  2024-05-09  2.57%  2.54%  -0.04 \n 7  2024-04-17  3.60%  2.57%  -1.03 \n 8  2024-02-21  3.43%  3.60%  +0.17 \n 9  2024-01-15  3.23%  3.43%  +0.20 \n 10  2023-12-29  2.10%  3.23%  +1.12 \n 11  2023-12-11  2.09%  2.10%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-08-14  2.74%  2.09%  -0.66 \n 13  2023-05-08  2.55%  2.74%  +0.19 \n 14  2023-03-07  12.47%  2.55%  -9.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.mirch.io/2018/11/05/cve-2018-18556-vyos-privilege-escalation-via-sudo-pppd-for-operator-users/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-18556 \u2013 VyOS Privilege escalation via sudo pppd for operator users \u2013 Rich MirchExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.vyos.io/the-operator-level-is-proved-insecure-and-will-be-removed-in-the-next-releases", "ref_desc": "The \"operator\" level is proved insecure and will be removed in the next releasesExploit;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KbARdH6pvT9HhRbl5yeDgM5bo6M.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159234/VyOS-restricted-shell-Escape-Privilege-Escalation.html", "ref_desc": "VyOS restricted-shell Escape / Privilege Escalation \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
