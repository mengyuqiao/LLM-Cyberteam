{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1000874", "Description": "PHP cebe markdown parser version 1.2.0 and earlier contains a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in all distributed parsers allowing a malicious crafted script to be executed that can result in the lose of user data and sensitive user information. This attack can be exploited by crafting a three backtick wrapped payload with a character in front: L: \"```<script>alert();</script>```\". NOTE: This has been argued as a non-issue (see references) since it is not the parser's job to sanitize malicious code from a parsed document", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000874", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCebe\u00bbMarkdownVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:cebe:markdown:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-29  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cebe/markdown/issues/166#issuecomment-508230493", "ref_desc": "Inconsistent behavior of multiple backticks \u00b7 Issue #166 \u00b7 cebe/markdown \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cebe/markdown/issues/166", "ref_desc": "Inconsistent behavior of multiple backticks \u00b7 Issue #166 \u00b7 cebe/markdown \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
