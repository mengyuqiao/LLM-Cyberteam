{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15006", "Description": "The ZTE ZMAX Champ Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.android.zte.hiddenmenu (versionCode=23, versionName=6.0.1) that contains an exported broadcast receiver app component named com.android.zte.hiddenmenu.CommandReceiver that is accessible to any app co-located on the device. This app component, when it receives a broadcast intent with a certain action string, will write a non-standard (i.e., not defined in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code) command to the /cache/recovery/command file to be executed in recovery mode. Once the device boots into recovery mode, it will crash, boot into recovery mode, and crash again. This crash loop will keep repeating, which makes the device unusable. There is no way to boot into an alternate mode once the crash loop starts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15006", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZteusa\u00bbZte Zmax Champ Firmware\u00bbVersion:6.0.1cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_zmax_champ_firmware:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Zteusa\u00bbZte Zmax Champ\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-09  0.12%  0.08%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-12-22  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106361", "ref_desc": "ZTE ZMAX Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7tcCvfat-FNDY_JQ1wdL8yArqPY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/di55zHOFoUoDcUbFdhEyps0WwL8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/", "ref_desc": "Kryptowire Provides Details on DEFCON 2018 Presentation: Vulnerable Out of the Box - An Evaluation of Android Carrier Devices - KryptowireThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ePdPR6-heyAn2FjJ19P0pu_CWlA.html"}]}
