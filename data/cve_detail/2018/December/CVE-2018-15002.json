{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15002", "Description": "The Vivo V7 device with a build fingerprint of vivo/1718/1718:7.1.2/N2G47H/compil11021857:user/release-keys allows any app co-located on the device to set system properties as the com.android.phone user. The com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.2) that contains an exported service named com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode.MbnTestService that allows any app co-located on the device to provide key-value pairs to set certain system properties. Notably, system properties with the persist.* prefix can be set which will survive a reboot. On the Vivo V7 device, when the persist.sys.input.log property is set to have a value of yes, the user's screen touches be written to the logcat log by the InputDispatcher for all apps. The system-wide logcat log can be obtained from external storage via a different known vulnerability on the device. The READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is necessary to access the log files containing the user's touch coordinates. With some effort, the user's touch coordinates can be mapped to key presses on a keyboard.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15002", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVivo\u00bbV7 Firmware\u00bbVersion:7.1.2cpe:2.3:o:vivo:v7_firmware:7.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Vivo\u00bbV7\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/di55zHOFoUoDcUbFdhEyps0WwL8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/", "ref_desc": "Kryptowire Provides Details on DEFCON 2018 Presentation: Vulnerable Out of the Box - An Evaluation of Android Carrier Devices - KryptowireThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ePdPR6-heyAn2FjJ19P0pu_CWlA.html"}]}
