It has an upload feature that allows an authenticated user with the administrator role to upload arbitrary files to the main website directory. Exploitation involves uploading a \".php\" file within a \".zip\" file because a ZIP archive is accepted by /admin/?req=modules&action=add as a plugin, and extracted to the main directory. In order for the \".zip\" file to be accepted, it must also contain a package.json file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20159", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nI-doit\u00bbI-doit\u00bbVersion:1.11.2    OpenEditioncpe:2.3:a:i-doit:i-doit:1.11.2:*:*:*:open:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  2.86%  2.80%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-10-24  2.45%  2.86%  +0.41 \n 3  2024-09-17  2.11%  2.45%  +0.35 \n 4  2024-04-25  1.45%  2.11%  +0.65 \n 5  2024-04-12  1.33%  1.45%  +0.13 \n 6  2024-03-28  1.30%  1.33%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-02-09  2.49%  1.30%  -1.19 \n 8  2024-01-13  3.12%  2.49%  -0.63 \n 9  2023-12-09  3.23%  3.12%  -0.11 \n 10  2023-11-06  3.29%  3.23%  -0.07 \n 11  2023-03-12  3.18%  3.29%  +0.12 \n 12  2023-03-07  5.16%  3.18%  -1.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45957", "ref_desc": "i-doit CMDB 1.11.2 - Remote Code ExecutionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pentest.com.tr/exploits/i-doit-CMDB-1-11-2-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Pentest Blog - Self-Improvement to Ethical HackingExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
