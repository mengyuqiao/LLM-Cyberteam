{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-4038", "Description": "An exploitable arbitrary write vulnerability exists in the open document format parser of the Atlantis Word Processor, version 3.2.7.2, while trying to null-terminate a string. A specially crafted document can allow an attacker to pass an untrusted value as a length to a constructor. This constructor will miscalculate a length and then use it to calculate the position to write a null byte. This can allow an attacker to corrupt memory, which can result in code execution under the context of the application. An attacker must convince a victim to open a specially crafted document in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-4038", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAtlantiswordprocessor\u00bbAtlantis Word Processor\u00bbVersion:3.2.7.2cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.2.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlantiswordprocessor\u00bbAtlantis Word Processor\u00bbVersion:3.2.7.1cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.21%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.12%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/131/Incorrect-Calculation-of-Buffer-Size.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0711", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0711 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
