{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15465", "Description": "A vulnerability in the authorization subsystem of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, but unprivileged (levels 0 and 1), remote attacker to perform privileged actions by using the web management interface. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user privileges when using the web management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific HTTP requests via HTTPS to an affected device as an unprivileged user. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files (including the running configuration) from the device or to upload and replace software images on the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15465", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance SoftwareVersions  before (<) 9.4.4.29cpe:2.3:a:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 9.7andbefore (<) 9.8.3.18cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 9.10andbefore (<) 9.10.1.7cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 9.5andbefore (<) 9.6.4.20cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 9.9andbefore (<) 9.9.2.36cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.58%  0.42%  -0.15 \n 2  2024-05-11  0.59%  0.58%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-04-19  0.83%  0.59%  -0.24 \n 4  2024-01-05  1.54%  0.83%  -0.71 \n 5  2023-12-18  1.75%  1.54%  -0.21 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  1.75%  +0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-46", "ref_desc": "[R1] Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance HTTP Privilege Escalation - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181219-asa-privesc", "ref_desc": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106256", "ref_desc": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance CVE-2018-15465 Remote Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
