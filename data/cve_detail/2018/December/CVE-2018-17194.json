{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-17194", "Description": "When a client request to a cluster node was replicated to other nodes in the cluster for verification, the Content-Length was forwarded. On a DELETE request, the body was ignored, but if the initial request had a Content-Length value other than 0, the receiving nodes would wait for the body and eventually timeout. Mitigation: The fix to check DELETE requests and overwrite non-zero Content-Length header values was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17194", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbNifiVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.7.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:nifi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-25  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2018-17194", "ref_desc": "Apache NiFi Security ReportsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
