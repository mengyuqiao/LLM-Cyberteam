{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5411", "Description": "Pixar's Tractor software, versions 2.2 and earlier, contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the field that allows a user to add a note to an existing node. The stored information is displayed when a user requests information about the node. An attacker could insert Javascript into this note field that is then saved and displayed to the end user. An attacker might include Javascript that could execute on an authenticated user's system that could lead to website redirects, session cookie hijacking, social engineering, etc. As this is stored with the information about the node, all other authenticated users with access to this data are also vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5411", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPixar\u00bbTractorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2cpe:2.3:a:pixar:tractor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-22  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-05-05  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2023-10-19  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106209", "ref_desc": "Pixar Tractor CVE-2018-5411 HTML Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/756913/", "ref_desc": "VU#756913 - Pixar Tractor contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilityUS Government Resource;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
