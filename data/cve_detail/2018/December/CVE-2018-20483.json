{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20483", "Description": "set_file_metadata in xattr.c in GNU Wget before 1.20.1 stores a file's origin URL in the user.xdg.origin.url metadata attribute of the extended attributes of the downloaded file, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information (e.g., credentials contained in the URL) by reading this attribute, as demonstrated by getfattr. This also applies to Referer information in the user.xdg.referrer.url metadata attribute. According to 2016-07-22 in the Wget ChangeLog, user.xdg.origin.url was partially based on the behavior of fwrite_xattr in tool_xattr.c in curl.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20483", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbWgetVersions  before (<) 1.20.1cpe:2.3:a:gnu:wget:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/tree/NEWS", "ref_desc": "NEWS - wget.git - GNU WgetRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3701", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:3701 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EhpumYjCIn8RCVPJ6RSU2n3bA2Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1077676739877232640", "ref_desc": "Hector Martin on Twitter: \"So yeah, um, this is not okay.
