Using the nashorn script engine the environment of the javascript execution for the Proxy Auto-Configuration leaks privileged objects, that can be used to circumvent the execution limits.

Both vectors allow remote code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17191", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbNetbeans\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:netbeans:9.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.24%  -0.07 \n 2  2024-11-09  0.42%  0.32%  -0.10 \n 3  2023-12-25  0.82%  0.42%  -0.40 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.26%  0.82%  +0.56 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.26%  -1.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106352", "ref_desc": "Apache NetBeans CVE-2018-17191 Remote Command Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d1c37966a316a326ab4ff4d4bc056322e8adcbe984e8145c0ecda7fa@%3Cdev.netbeans.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Pony Mail!Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
