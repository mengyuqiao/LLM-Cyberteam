{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20167", "Description": "Terminology before 1.3.1 allows Remote Code Execution because popmedia is mishandled, as demonstrated by an unsafe \"cat README.md\" command when \\e}pn is used. A popmedia control sequence can allow the malicious execution of executable file formats registered in the X desktop share MIME types (/usr/share/applications). The control sequence defers unknown file types to the handle_unknown_media() function, which executes xdg-open against the filename specified in the sequence. The use of xdg-open for all unknown file types allows executable file formats with a registered shared MIME type to be executed. An attacker can achieve remote code execution by introducing an executable file and a plain text file containing the control sequence through a fake software project (e.g., in Git or a tarball). When the control sequence is rendered (such as with cat), the executable file will be run.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20167", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nEnlightenment\u00bbTerminologyVersions  before (<) 1.3.1cpe:2.3:a:enlightenment:terminology:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.86%  1.61%  +0.75 \n 2  2024-11-26  0.66%  0.86%  +0.20 \n 3  2024-10-26  0.53%  0.66%  +0.13 \n 4  2023-12-11  0.45%  0.53%  +0.09 \n 5  2023-03-07  4.84%  0.45%  -4.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://phab.enlightenment.org/T7504", "ref_desc": "\u2693 T7504 media_unknown_handle in \\e}pn<FILE>\\0 control sequence allows remote code execution (RCE)Mitigation;Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://phab.enlightenment.org/rTRM1ac204da9148e7bccb1b5f34b523e2094dfc39e2", "ref_desc": "rTRM1ac204da9148Mitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.enlightenment.org/news/2018-12-16-terminology-1.3.1", "ref_desc": "Terminology 1.3.1 ReleaseMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
