{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20193", "Description": "Certain Secure Access SA Series SSL VPN products (originally developed by Juniper Networks but now sold and supported by Pulse Secure, LLC) allow privilege escalation, as demonstrated by Secure Access SSL VPN SA-4000 5.1R5 (build 9627) 4.2 Release (build 7631). This occurs because appropriate controls are not performed. Specifically, it is possible for a readonly user to change the administrator user password by making a local copy of the /dana-admin/user/update.cgi page, changing the \"user\" value, and saving the changes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20193", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPulsesecure\u00bbSecure Access Series Ssl Vpn Sa-4000\u00bbVersion:4.2cpe:2.3:a:pulsesecure:secure_access_series_ssl_vpn_sa-4000:4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPulsesecure\u00bbSecure Access Series Ssl Vpn Sa-4000\u00bbVersion:5.1r5cpe:2.3:a:pulsesecure:secure_access_series_ssl_vpn_sa-4000:5.1r5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-05-13  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 3  2023-08-18  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106289", "ref_desc": "Pulse Secure SSL VPN CVE-2018-20193 Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Dec/37", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CVE-2018-20193 - Privilege escalation in Juniper Secure Access SSL VPN - SA-4000, 5.1R5 (build 9627) 4.2 Release (build 7631)Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
