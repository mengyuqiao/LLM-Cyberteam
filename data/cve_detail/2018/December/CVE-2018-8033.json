{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-8033", "Description": "In Apache OFBiz 16.11.01 to 16.11.04, the OFBiz HTTP engine (org.apache.ofbiz.service.engine.HttpEngine.java) handles requests for HTTP services via the /webtools/control/httpService endpoint. Both POST and GET requests to the httpService endpoint may contain three parameters: serviceName, serviceMode, and serviceContext. The exploitation occurs by having DOCTYPEs pointing to external references that trigger a payload that returns secret information from the host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8033", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbOfbizVersions  from including (>=) 16.11.01andup to, including, (<=) 16.11.04cpe:2.3:a:apache:ofbiz:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.53% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-29  81.76%  4.53%  -77.24 \n 2  2024-04-25  4.53%  81.76%  +77.24 \n 3  2024-02-07  0.81%  4.53%  +3.71 \n 4  2023-11-10  5.63%  0.81%  -4.82 \n 5  2023-11-08  56.01%  5.63%  -50.38 \n 6  2023-09-22  20.11%  56.01%  +35.90 \n 7  2023-08-30  22.03%  20.11%  -1.92 \n 8  2023-08-10  25.57%  22.03%  -3.54 \n 9  2023-07-25  0.24%  25.57%  +25.33 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.90%  0.24%  -2.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e8fb551e86e901932081f81ee9985bb72052b4d412f23d89b1282777@%3Cuser.ofbiz.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] CVE-2018-8033 Apache OFBiz XXE Vulnerability in HttpEngine - Pony MailExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
