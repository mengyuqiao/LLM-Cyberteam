{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18993", "Description": "Two stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been discovered in CX-One Versions 4.42 and prior (CX-Programmer Versions 9.66 and prior and CX-Server Versions 5.0.23 and prior). When processing project files, the application allows input data to exceed the buffer. An attacker could use a specially crafted project file to overflow the buffer and execute code under the privileges of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18993", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOmron\u00bbCx-programmerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.66cpe:2.3:a:omron:cx-programmer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOmron\u00bbCx-oneVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.42cpe:2.3:a:omron:cx-one:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOmron\u00bbCx-serverVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.0.23cpe:2.3:a:omron:cx-server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "28.95% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  32.31%  28.95%  -3.35 \n 2  2024-04-26  30.88%  32.31%  +1.43 \n 3  2023-05-17  29.19%  30.88%  +1.69 \n 4  2023-05-02  31.90%  29.19%  -2.71 \n 5  2023-03-15  28.04%  31.90%  +3.86 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.01%  28.04%  +27.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-338-01", "ref_desc": "Omron CX-One | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8qjFscXehFzPy4Fj-3s-b-mOM1Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106106", "ref_desc": "Omron CX-One ICSA-18-338-01 Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HyhwdJbVwIeOhj-evEv-ISnaHDg.html"}]}
