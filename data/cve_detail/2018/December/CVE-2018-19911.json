{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-19911", "Description": "FreeSWITCH through 1.8.2, when mod_xml_rpc is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the api/system or txtapi/system (or api/bg_system or txtapi/bg_system) query string on TCP port 8080, as demonstrated by an api/system?calc URI. This can also be exploited via CSRF. Alternatively, the default password of works for the freeswitch account can sometimes be used.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19911", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nFreeswitch\u00bbFreeswitchVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.8.2cpe:2.3:a:freeswitch:freeswitch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.62%  +0.32 \n 2  2024-11-15  0.42%  0.30%  -0.12 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.16%  0.42%  +0.26 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-03-15  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 6  2024-02-09  0.39%  0.14%  -0.24 \n 7  2024-01-04  0.27%  0.39%  +0.11 \n 8  2023-03-07  5.25%  0.27%  -4.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/iSafeBlue/freeswitch_rce/blob/master/freeswitch_rce.py", "ref_desc": "freeswitch_rce/freeswitch_rce.py at master \u00b7 iSafeBlue/freeswitch_rce \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/iSafeBlue/freeswitch_rce/blob/master/README-en.md", "ref_desc": "freeswitch_rce/README-en.md at master \u00b7 iSafeBlue/freeswitch_rce \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
