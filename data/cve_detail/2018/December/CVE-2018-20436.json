{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20436", "Description": "The \"secret chat\" feature in Telegram 4.9.1 for Android has a \"side channel\" in which Telegram servers send GET requests for URLs typed while composing a chat message, before that chat message is sent. There are also GET requests to other URLs on the same web server. This also affects one or more other Telegram products, such as Telegram Web-version 0.7.0. In addition, it can be interpreted as an SSRF issue. NOTE: a third party has reported that potentially unwanted behavior is caused by misconfiguration of the \"Secret chats > Preview links\" setting", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20436", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nTelegram\u00bbTelegram\u00bbVersion:4.9.1ForAndroidcpe:2.3:a:telegram:telegram:4.9.1:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions\nTelegram\u00bbWEB\u00bbVersion:0.7.0cpe:2.3:a:telegram:web:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.98% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.86%  0.98%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-05-16  0.98%  0.86%  -0.12 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.98%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://misteralfa-hack.blogspot.com/2018/12/telegram-siempre-in-middle.html", "ref_desc": "Capitan Alfa: TELEGRAM (Siempre) In-The-Middle.
