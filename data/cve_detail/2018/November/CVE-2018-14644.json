{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14644", "Description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.1.4. A remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14644", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nPowerdns\u00bbRecursorVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.1.4cpe:2.3:a:powerdns:recursor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-28  0.25%  0.18%  -0.07 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.16%  0.25%  +0.09 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-14644", "ref_desc": "1648378 \u2013 (CVE-2018-14644) CVE-2018-14644 pdns: crafted query for meta-types can lead to a DoSIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-07.html", "ref_desc": "PowerDNS Security Advisory 2018-07: Crafted query for meta-types can cause a denial of service \u2014 PowerDNS Recursor documentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
