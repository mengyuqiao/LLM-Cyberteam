{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-19148", "Description": "Caddy through 0.11.0 sends incorrect certificates for certain invalid requests, making it easier for attackers to enumerate hostnames. Specifically, when unable to match a Host header with a vhost in its configuration, it serves the X.509 certificate for a randomly selected vhost in its configuration. Repeated requests (with a nonexistent hostname in the Host header) permit full enumeration of all certificates on the server. This generally permits an attacker to easily and accurately discover the existence of and relationships among hostnames that weren't meant to be public, though this information could likely have been discovered via other methods with additional effort.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19148", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCaddyserver\u00bbCaddyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.11.0cpe:2.3:a:caddyserver:caddy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.14%  0.12%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-04-02  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-05  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mholt/caddy/pull/2015", "ref_desc": "tls: Restructure and improve certificate management by mholt \u00b7 Pull Request #2015 \u00b7 caddyserver/caddy \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitytrails.com/blog/caddy-web-server-ssl-bug", "ref_desc": "Making the Web a Better Place: Fixing Caddy Web Server Hostname Enumeration Vulnerability (CVE-2018-19148)Exploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mholt/caddy/issues/2334", "ref_desc": "Problem with the way Caddy serves multiple certificates \u00b7 Issue #2334 \u00b7 caddyserver/caddy \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mholt/caddy/issues/1303", "ref_desc": "Caddy serves wrong SSL cert for site that is not served on HTTPS port \u00b7 Issue #1303 \u00b7 caddyserver/caddy \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
