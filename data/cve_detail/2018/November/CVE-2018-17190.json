{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-17190", "Description": "In all versions of Apache Spark, its standalone resource manager accepts code to execute on a 'master' host, that then runs that code on 'worker' hosts. The master itself does not, by design, execute user code. A specially-crafted request to the master can, however, cause the master to execute code too. Note that this does not affect standalone clusters with authentication enabled. While the master host typically has less outbound access to other resources than a worker, the execution of code on the master is nevertheless unexpected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17190", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSparkcpe:2.3:a:apache:spark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.58%  4.07%  +1.49 \n 2  2024-10-29  1.96%  2.58%  +0.62 \n 3  2024-09-28  0.99%  1.96%  +0.97 \n 4  2024-09-03  1.40%  0.99%  -0.41 \n 5  2024-07-08  1.49%  1.40%  -0.09 \n 6  2024-05-21  1.53%  1.49%  -0.04 \n 7  2024-04-11  1.64%  1.53%  -0.11 \n 8  2023-11-13  1.42%  1.64%  +0.22 \n 9  2023-11-08  0.96%  1.42%  +0.46 \n 10  2023-10-29  0.95%  0.96%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-10-11  0.84%  0.95%  +0.11 \n 12  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.84%  -1.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/341c3187f15cdb0d353261d2bfecf2324d56cb7db1339bfc7b30f6e5@%3Cdev.spark.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-17190: Unsecured Apache Spark standalone executes user code - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2020CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/aS9sKtk6QJuUkC-PZDOr0rx3cDo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-21", "ref_desc": "Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201903-21) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BT5M_aWugqMYcqPpCwbEhZEJRvI.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105976", "ref_desc": "Apache Spark CVE-2018-17190 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
