{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-17187", "Description": "The Apache Qpid Proton-J transport includes an optional wrapper layer to perform TLS, enabled by use of the 'transport.ssl(...)' methods. Unless a verification mode was explicitly configured, client and server modes previously defaulted as documented to not verifying a peer certificate, with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificate verification mode with or without hostname verification being performed. The latter hostname verifying mode was not implemented in Apache Qpid Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to use it resulting in an exception. This left only the option to verify the certificate is trusted, leaving such a client vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. Uses of the Proton-J protocol engine which do not utilise the optional transport TLS wrapper are not impacted, e.g. usage within Qpid JMS. Uses of Proton-J utilising the optional transport TLS wrapper layer that wish to enable hostname verification must be upgraded to version 0.30.0 or later and utilise the VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME configuration, which is now the default for client mode usage unless configured otherwise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17187", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbQpid Proton-jVersions  from including (>=) 0.3andup to, including, (<=) 0.29.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:qpid_proton-j:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-12-12  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 3  2023-11-07  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-04-11  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.25%  0.10%  -1.15 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105935", "ref_desc": "Apache Qpid Proton-J CVE-2018-17187 Certificate Validation Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON-1962", "ref_desc": "[PROTON-1962] [CVE-2018-17187] transport TLS wrapper hostname verification mode not implemented - ASF JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://qpid.apache.org/cves/CVE-2018-17187.html", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-17187: transport TLS wrapper hostname verification mode not implemented - Apache Qpid\u2122Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-users/201811.mbox/%3CCAFitrpQSV73Vz7rJYfLJK7gvEymZSCR5ooWUeU8j4jzRydk-eg%40mail.gmail.com%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [CVE-2018-17187] Apache Qpid Proton-J transport TLS wrapper hostname verification mode not implementedMitigation;Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
