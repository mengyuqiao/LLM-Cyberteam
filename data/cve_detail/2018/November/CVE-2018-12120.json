{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12120", "Description": "Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0: Debugger port 5858 listens on any interface by default: When the debugger is enabled with `node --debug` or `node debug`, it listens to port 5858 on all interfaces by default. This may allow remote computers to attach to the debug port and evaluate arbitrary JavaScript. The default interface is now localhost. It has always been possible to start the debugger on a specific interface, such as `node --debug=localhost`. The debugger was removed in Node.js 8 and replaced with the inspector, so no versions from 8 and later are vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12120", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.15.0cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-20  0.23%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-419 Unprotected Primary Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/419/Unprotected-Primary-Channel.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/november-2018-security-releases/", "ref_desc": "November 2018 Security Releases | Node.jsVendor Advisory;PatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LKjeqGNZ80bi6EX_7f28jgPPzVU.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106040", "ref_desc": "Node.js Debugger CVE-2018-12120 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
