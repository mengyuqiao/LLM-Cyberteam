{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15452", "Description": "A vulnerability in the DLL loading component of Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints on Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to disable system scanning services or take other actions to prevent detection of unauthorized intrusions. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of resources loaded by a system process at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable the targeted system's scanning services and ultimately prevent the system from being protected from further intrusion. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15452", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdvanced Malware Protection For Endpoints\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:advanced_malware_protection_for_endpoints:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105759", "ref_desc": "Cisco AMP CVE-2018-15452 DLL Loading Local Local Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181029-amp-dll", "ref_desc": "Cisco Advanced Malware Protection for Endpoints on Windows DLL Preloading VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
