{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15445", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Energy Management Suite Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15445", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnergy Management Suite Software\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:energy_management_suite_software:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.83% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.38%  0.83%  +0.45 \n 2  2024-08-22  0.53%  0.38%  -0.15 \n 3  2024-06-26  0.63%  0.53%  -0.10 \n 4  2024-03-30  0.64%  0.63%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-03-08  0.91%  0.64%  -0.27 \n 6  2023-11-20  0.65%  0.91%  +0.26 \n 7  2023-11-02  0.67%  0.65%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.62%  0.67%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-06-24  0.80%  0.62%  -0.18 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.80%  -0.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-ems-csrf", "ref_desc": "Cisco Energy Management Suite Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105859", "ref_desc": "Cisco Energy Management Suite CVE-2018-15445 Cross Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-36", "ref_desc": "[R1] Cisco Energy Management Suite Multiple Vulnerabilities - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xAKrlN8zUDHjC9RAt-gKJd5fivc.html"}]}
