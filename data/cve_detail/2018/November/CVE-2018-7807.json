{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7807", "Description": "Data Center Expert, versions 7.5.0 and earlier, allows for the upload of a zip file from its user interface to the server. A carefully crafted, malicious file could be mistakenly uploaded by an authenticated user via this feature which could contain path traversal file names. As such, it could allow for the arbitrary upload of files contained with the zip onto the server file system outside of the intended directory. This is leveraging the more commonly known ZipSlip vulnerability within Java code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7807", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nSchneider-electric\u00bbStruxureware Data Center ExpertVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.5.0cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:struxureware_data_center_expert:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0", "ref_desc": "Security fixes in StruxureWare Data Center Expert v7.6.0 - User assistance for StruxureWare Data Center Expert 7.x - Help Center: Support for EcoStruxure IT, StruxureWare for Data Centers, and NetBotzVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hN_L6D9Ieu_q6eudvDMkkwodgy8.html"}]}
