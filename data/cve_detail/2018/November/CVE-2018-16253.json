{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16253", "Description": "In sig_verify() in x509.c in axTLS version 2.1.3 and before, the PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification does not properly verify the ASN.1 metadata. Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being used, which could lead to impersonation through fake X.509 certificates. This is an even more permissive variant of CVE-2006-4790 and CVE-2014-1568.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16253", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAxtls Project\u00bbAxtlsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:axtls_project:axtls:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-16  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-26  0.20%  0.18%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-03-30  0.16%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.17%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sourceforge.net/p/axtls/mailman/message/36459928/", "ref_desc": "axTLS Embedded SSL / Re: [axtls-general] Problems of PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA Signature VerificationExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2E41RPVHrYwW-uUAzSoewicSuLs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/igrr/axtls-8266/commit/5efe2947ab45e81d84b5f707c51d1c64be52f36c", "ref_desc": "Apply CVE fixes for X509 parsing \u00b7 igrr/axtls-8266@5efe294 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sCJteeZn8daBYLsg3s9Sjtr_vLU.html"}]}
