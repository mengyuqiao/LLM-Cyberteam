{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15443", "Description": "A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule that inspects certain types of TCP traffic. The vulnerability is due to incorrect TCP retransmission handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP connection request through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured IPS rules and allow uninspected traffic onto the network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15443", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower System Software\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_system_software:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-09-16  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-08-22  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-03-30  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-fde-tcp-bypass", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Detection Engine TCP Intrusion Prevention System Rule Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105870", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower System Software CVE-2018-15443 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
