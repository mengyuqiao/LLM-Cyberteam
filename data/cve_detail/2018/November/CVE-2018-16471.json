{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16471", "Description": "There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Rack before 2.0.6 and 1.6.11. Carefully crafted requests can impact the data returned by the `scheme` method on `Rack::Request`. Applications that expect the scheme to be limited to 'http' or 'https' and do not escape the return value could be vulnerable to an XSS attack. Note that applications using the normal escaping mechanisms provided by Rails may not impacted, but applications that bypass the escaping mechanisms, or do not use them may be vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16471", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRack Project\u00bbRackVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.6cpe:2.3:a:rack_project:rack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRack Project\u00bbRackVersions  from including (>=) 1.6.0andbefore (<) 1.6.11cpe:2.3:a:rack_project:rack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.58%  0.46%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-08-28  0.80%  0.58%  -0.22 \n 3  2024-07-02  0.59%  0.80%  +0.21 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.46%  0.59%  +0.12 \n 5  2023-11-07  0.73%  0.46%  -0.27 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.88%  0.73%  -0.15 \n 7  2023-06-29  1.25%  0.88%  -0.36 \n 8  2023-03-09  1.76%  1.25%  -0.51 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  1.76%  +0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/11/msg00022.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1585-1] ruby-rack security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00032.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2019:1553-1: moderate: Security update f", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4089-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-4089-1: Rack vulnerability | Ubuntu security notices", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/GKsAFT924Ag", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2018-16471] Possible XSS vulnerability in Rack - Google GroepenMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-02/msg00016.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0214-1: moderate: Security update fCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WWZwdVHUc9AE1VndZQYutZWE2yg.html"}]}
