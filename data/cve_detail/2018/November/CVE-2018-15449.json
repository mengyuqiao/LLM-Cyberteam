{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15449", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Video Surveillance Media Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web-based management interface to become unreachable, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15449", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbVideo Surveillance Media Server\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:video_surveillance_media_server:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-22  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-26  0.13%  0.10%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-03-30  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.16%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-04-06  0.17%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.17%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105863", "ref_desc": "Cisco Video Surveillance Media Server CVE-2018-15449 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-vsms-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Video Surveillance Media Server Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
