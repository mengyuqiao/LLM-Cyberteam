{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-19410", "Description": "PRTG Network Monitor before 18.2.40.1683 allows remote unauthenticated attackers to create users with read-write privileges (including administrator). A remote unauthenticated user can craft an HTTP request and override attributes of the 'include' directive in /public/login.htm and perform a Local File Inclusion attack, by including /api/addusers and executing it. By providing the 'id' and 'users' parameters, an unauthenticated attacker can create a user with read-write privileges (including administrator).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19410", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nPaessler\u00bbPrtg Network MonitorVersions  before (<) 18.2.40.1683cpe:2.3:a:paessler:prtg_network_monitor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.56%  0.38%  -0.18 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.31%  0.56%  +0.25 \n 3  2024-05-10  0.29%  0.31%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.26%  0.29%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.56%  0.26%  -0.30 \n 6  2023-03-07  9.03%  0.56%  -8.47 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/threatscape/pt-2018-24/", "ref_desc": "PT-2018-24: Authentication Bypass, Improper Authorization and Local File Inclusion in PRTG Network MonitorThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
