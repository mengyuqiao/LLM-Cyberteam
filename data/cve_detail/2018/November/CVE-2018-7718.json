{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7718", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Telexy QPath 5.4.462. A low privileged authenticated user supplying a specially crafted serialized request to AdanitDataService.svc may modify user information, including but not limited to email address, username, and password, of other user accounts. The simplest attack approach is for the attacker to intercept their own password-change request and modify the username before the request reaches the server. Also, changing a victim's email address can have a similar account-takeover consequence.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7718", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTelexy\u00bbQpath\u00bbVersion:5.4.462cpe:2.3:a:telexy:qpath:5.4.462:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.dropbox.com/s/6tlee2uj3t3su8n/Telexy-QPath-CVE-2018-7718.pdf", "ref_desc": "Telexy-QPath-CVE-2018-7718.pdfThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
