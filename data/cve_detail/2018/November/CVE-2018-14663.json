{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-14663", "Description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS DNSDist before 1.3.3 allowing a remote attacker to craft a DNS query with trailing data such that the addition of a record by dnsdist, for example an OPT record when adding EDNS Client Subnet, might result in the trailing data being smuggled to the backend as a valid record while not seen by dnsdist. This is an issue when dnsdist is deployed as a DNS Firewall and used to filter some records that should not be received by the backend. This issue occurs only when either the 'useClientSubnet' or the experimental 'addXPF' parameters are used when declaring a new backend.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14663", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nPowerdns\u00bbDnsdistVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.2cpe:2.3:a:powerdns:dnsdist:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-05  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-14663", "ref_desc": "1649051 \u2013 (CVE-2018-14663) CVE-2018-14663 dnsdist: Record smuggling when adding ECS or XPFIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2018-08.html", "ref_desc": "PowerDNS Security Advisory for dnsdist 2018-08: Record smuggling when adding ECS or XPF \u2014 dnsdist documentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
