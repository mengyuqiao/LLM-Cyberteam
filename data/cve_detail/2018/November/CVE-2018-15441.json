The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP POST requests that contain malicious SQL statements to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify and delete arbitrary data in the PLM database or gain shell access with the privileges of the postgres user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15441", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime License ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 11.0.1andup to, including, (<=) 11.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_license_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbPrime License Manager\u00bbVersion:11.5(1)UpdateSU5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_license_manager:11.5\\(1\\):su5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-09-12  0.13%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-07-17  0.19%  0.13%  -0.06 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-06-24  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181128-plm-sql-inject", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime License Manager SQL Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106039", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime License Manager CVE-2018-15441 SQL Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
