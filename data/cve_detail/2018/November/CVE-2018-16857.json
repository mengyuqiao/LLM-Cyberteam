{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16857", "Description": "Samba from version 4.9.0 and before version 4.9.3 that have AD DC configurations watching for bad passwords (to restrict brute forcing of passwords) in a window of more than 3 minutes may not watch for bad passwords at all. The primary risk from this issue is with regards to domains that have been upgraded from Samba 4.8 and earlier. In these cases the manual testing done to confirm an organisation's password policies apply as expected may not have been re-done after the upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16857", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSamba\u00bbSambaVersions  from including (>=) 4.9.0andbefore (<) 4.9.3cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.67%  0.41%  -0.26 \n 2  2024-05-30  0.62%  0.67%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-04-20  1.10%  0.62%  -0.48 \n 4  2023-12-27  0.80%  1.10%  +0.30 \n 5  2023-11-22  0.87%  0.80%  -0.08 \n 6  2023-04-26  0.92%  0.87%  -0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.92%  -0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-358 Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/358/Improperly-Implemented-Security-Check-for-Standard.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-16857", "ref_desc": "1649278 \u2013 (CVE-2018-16857) CVE-2018-16857 samba: Bad password count in AD DC not always effectiveIssue Tracking;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-52", "ref_desc": "Samba: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202003-52) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B6yBcu3P96xGaclX8rVmrG5613o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2018-16857.html", "ref_desc": "Samba - Security Announcement ArchiveMitigation;Vendor Advisory;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20181127-0001/", "ref_desc": "November 2018 Samba Vulnerabilities in NetApp StorageGRID Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oaGW6rvkluUqzGO-iweIMnK57W0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106024", "ref_desc": "Samba Security Bypass and Denial of Service VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XNQck_GwQyF8ceAsfCf0BffeoeE.html"}]}
