{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-19417", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the MQTT server in Contiki-NG before 4.2. The function parse_publish_vhdr() that parses MQTT PUBLISH messages with a variable length header uses memcpy to input data into a fixed size buffer. The allocated buffer can fit only MQTT_MAX_TOPIC_LENGTH (default 64) bytes, and a length check is missing. This could lead to Remote Code Execution via a stack-smashing attack (overwriting the function return address). Contiki-NG does not separate the MQTT server from other servers and the OS modules, so access to all memory regions is possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19417", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  before (<) 4.2cpe:2.3:a:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.31%  1.63%  +0.33 \n 2  2024-12-06  1.15%  1.31%  +0.15 \n 3  2024-09-30  1.13%  1.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.16%  1.13%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/600", "ref_desc": "Stack based buffer overflow while parsing MQTT messages (parsing PUBLISH message with variable length header) \u00b7 Issue #600 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
