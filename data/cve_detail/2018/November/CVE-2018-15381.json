{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15381", "Description": "A Java deserialization vulnerability in Cisco Unity Express (CUE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the root user. The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious serialized Java object to the listening Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15381", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnity ExpressVersions  before (<) 9.0.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unity_express:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "51.95% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  59.42%  51.95%  -7.46 \n 2  2024-08-22  58.94%  59.42%  +0.48 \n 3  2024-06-26  65.83%  58.94%  -6.90 \n 4  2024-05-09  81.33%  65.83%  -15.50 \n 5  2024-03-30  86.04%  81.33%  -4.71 \n 6  2024-01-31  88.51%  86.04%  -2.47 \n 7  2023-12-07  89.61%  88.51%  -1.10 \n 8  2023-11-20  90.41%  89.61%  -0.80 \n 9  2023-11-02  90.61%  90.41%  -0.20 \n 10  2023-07-08  90.18%  90.61%  +0.43 \n 11  2023-06-24  91.39%  90.18%  -1.21 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.14%  91.39%  +90.25 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105876", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unity Express CVE-2018-15381 Arbitrary Command Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1042130", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unity Express Java Remote Method Invocation Flaw Lets Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code with Root Privileges - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-cue", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unity Express Arbitrary Command Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
