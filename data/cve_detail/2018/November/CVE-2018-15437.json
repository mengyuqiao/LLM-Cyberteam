{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15437", "Description": "A vulnerability in the system scanning component of Cisco Immunet and Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints running on Microsoft Windows could allow a local attacker to disable the scanning functionality of the product. This could allow executable files to be launched on the system without being analyzed for threats. The vulnerability is due to improper process resource handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining local access to a system running Microsoft Windows and protected by Cisco Immunet or Cisco AMP for Endpoints and executing a malicious file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the scanning services from functioning properly and ultimately prevent the system from being protected from further intrusion.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15437", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdvanced Malware Protection For Endpoints\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:advanced_malware_protection_for_endpoints:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbImmunet For Endpoints\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:immunet_for_endpoints:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.29%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-11-23  0.18%  0.23%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-10-18  0.24%  0.18%  -0.06 \n 4  2024-07-23  1.96%  0.24%  -1.72 \n 5  2023-11-02  1.81%  1.96%  +0.15 \n 6  2023-10-01  1.01%  1.81%  +0.80 \n 7  2023-08-29  0.80%  1.01%  +0.21 \n 8  2023-07-26  1.27%  0.80%  -0.47 \n 9  2023-07-08  1.25%  1.27%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.83%  1.25%  -0.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105867", "ref_desc": "Cisco Immunet and AMP for Endpoints CVE-2018-15437 Local Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45829/", "ref_desc": "Cisco Immunet < 6.2.0 / Cisco AMP For Endpoints 6.2.0 - Denial of ServiceExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-imm-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Immunet and Cisco AMP for Endpoints System Scan Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
