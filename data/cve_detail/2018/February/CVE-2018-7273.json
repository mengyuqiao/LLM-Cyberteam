{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7273", "Description": "In the Linux kernel through 4.15.4, the floppy driver reveals the addresses of kernel functions and global variables using printk calls within the function show_floppy in drivers/block/floppy.c. An attacker can read this information from dmesg and use the addresses to find the locations of kernel code and data and bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7273", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.15.4cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-17  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-04-08  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-21  0.10%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.04%  0.10%  -1.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/2/20/669", "ref_desc": "LKML: Brian Belleville: [PATCH] floppy: Don't print kernel addresses to log in show_floppyMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103088", "ref_desc": "Linux Kernel 'drivers/block/floppy.c' Local Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44325/", "ref_desc": "Linux Kernel < 4.15.4 - 'show_floppy' KASLR Address LeakExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
