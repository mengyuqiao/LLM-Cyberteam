{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6791", "Description": "An issue was discovered in soliduiserver/deviceserviceaction.cpp in KDE Plasma Workspace before 5.12.0. When a vfat thumbdrive that contains `` or $() in its volume label is plugged in and mounted through the device notifier, it's interpreted as a shell command, leading to a possibility of arbitrary command execution. An example of an offending volume label is \"$(touch b)\" -- this will create a file called b in the home folder.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6791", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKDE\u00bbPlasma-workspaceVersions  before (<) 5.12.0cpe:2.3:a:kde:plasma-workspace:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  2.41%  0.17%  -2.24 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4116", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4116-1 plasma-workspaceThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=389815", "ref_desc": "389815 \u2013 Possibility of code execution when opening volume which label contains `` or $() from notifications panelIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cgit.kde.org/plasma-workspace.git/commit/?id=9db872df82c258315c6ebad800af59e81ffb9212", "ref_desc": "plasma-workspace.git - Plasma Workspace: Various Components needed to run a Plasma based environmentVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
