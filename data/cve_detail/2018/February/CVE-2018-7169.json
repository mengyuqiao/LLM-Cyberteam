{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7169", "Description": "An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used \"group blacklisting\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7169", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nShadow Project\u00bbShadow\u00bbVersion:4.5cpe:2.3:a:shadow_project:shadow:4.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2023-07-09  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shadow/+bug/1729357", "ref_desc": "Bug #1729357 \u201cunprivileged user can drop supplementary groups\u201d : Bugs : shadow package : UbuntuExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201805-09", "ref_desc": "Shadow: security bypass (GLSA 201805-09) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
