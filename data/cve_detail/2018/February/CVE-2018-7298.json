{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7298", "Description": "In /usr/local/etc/config/addons/mh/loopupd.sh on eQ-3 AG HomeMatic CCU2 2.29.22 devices, software update packages are downloaded via the HTTP protocol, which does not provide any cryptographic protection of the downloaded contents. An attacker with a privileged network position (which could be obtained via DNS spoofing of www.meine-homematic.de or other approaches) can exploit this issue in order to provide arbitrary malicious firmware updates to the CCU2. This can result in a full system compromise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7298", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEq-3\u00bbHomematic Central Control Unit Ccu2 Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.29.22cpe:2.3:o:eq-3:homematic_central_control_unit_ccu2_firmware:2.29.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Eq-3\u00bbHomematic Central Control Unit Ccu2\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-04  0.22%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://atomic111.github.io/article/homematic-ccu2-firmware-via-plain-http", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-7298: Downloading Firmware via Plain HTTP in HomeMatic CCU2 \u00b7 Patrick M\u00fcnch BlogThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
