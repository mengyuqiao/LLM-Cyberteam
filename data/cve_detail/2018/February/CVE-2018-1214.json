{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1214", "Description": "Dell EMC SupportAssist Enterprise version 1.1 creates a local Windows user account named \"OMEAdapterUser\" with a default password as part of the installation process. This unnecessary user account also remains even after an upgrade from v1.1 to v1.2. Access to the management console can be achieved by someone with knowledge of the default password. If SupportAssist Enterprise is installed on a server running OpenManage Essentials (OME), the OmeAdapterUser user account is added as a member of the OmeAdministrators group for the OME. An unauthorized person with knowledge of the default password and access to the OME web console could potentially use this account to gain access to the affected installation of OME with OmeAdministrators privileges. This is fixed in version 1.2.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1214", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbEmc Supportassist Enterprise\u00bbVersion:1.1cpe:2.3:a:dell:emc_supportassist_enterprise:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/sln308843/dell-emc-supportassist-enterprise-server-storage-networking-undocumented-default-account-vulnerability", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
