{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1000057", "Description": "Jenkins Credentials Binding Plugin 1.14 and earlier masks passwords it provides to build processes in their build logs. Jenkins however transforms provided password values, e.g. replacing environment variable references, which could result in values different from but similar to configured passwords being provided to the build. Those values are not subject to masking, and could allow unauthorized users to recover the original password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000057", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbCredentials Binding\u00bbForJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.14cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:credentials_binding:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-02-05/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2018-02-05Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KX8YDY5YuIituoTHgEnZMAsPCug.html"}]}
