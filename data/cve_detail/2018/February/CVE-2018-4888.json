This vulnerability is an instance of a use after free vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted PDF file that can cause a memory access violation exception in the XFA engine because of a dangling reference left as a consequence of freeing an object in the computation that manipulates internal nodes in a graph representation of a document object model used in XFA. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-4888", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat ReaderVersions  from including (>=) 17.0andup to, including, (<=) 17.011.30070cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobatVersions  from including (>=) 17.0andup to, including, (<=) 17.011.30070cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Dc\u00bb     ContinuousEditionVersions  from including (>=) -andup to, including, (<=) 18.009.20050cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_dc:*:*:*:*:continuous:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Dc\u00bb     ClassicEditionVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.006.30394cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_dc:*:*:*:*:classic:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Reader Dc\u00bb     ContinuousEditionVersions  from including (>=) -andup to, including, (<=) 18.009.20050cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader_dc:*:*:*:*:continuous:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Reader Dc\u00bb     ClassicEditionVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.006.30394cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader_dc:*:*:*:*:classic:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.23%  1.27%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-02-07  1.25%  1.23%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-01-07  1.27%  1.25%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-12-13  1.51%  1.27%  -0.24 \n 5  2023-10-17  2.23%  1.51%  -0.72 \n 6  2023-07-21  2.77%  2.23%  -0.54 \n 7  2023-04-16  3.30%  2.77%  -0.52 \n 8  2023-03-07  3.18%  3.30%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040364", "ref_desc": "Adobe Acrobat/Reader Multiple Bugs Let Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FW4bU0a9VgIk5e8sRhI-3vzLvhI.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102995", "ref_desc": "Adobe Acrobat and Reader Multiple Remote Code Execution VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UJJW93zyIretJvq_gfgB3QDpdzk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb18-02.html", "ref_desc": "Adobe Security BulletinVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VcsWUzvEUza6vixlkiMVWRc7AjU.html"}]}
