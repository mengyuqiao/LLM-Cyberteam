{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-1000030", "Description": "Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a Heap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000030", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:14.04    LTSEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:14.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:12.04    ESMEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:12.04:*:*:*:esm:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:16.04    LTSEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:16.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:18.04    LTSEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:18.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nPython\u00bbPythonVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.7.14cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  3.09%  0.08%  -3.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2020Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1DkN0mscFmHz91IMcoXFvJ_ith4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/", "ref_desc": "USN-3817-2: Python vulnerabilities | Ubuntu security noticesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1RuHM7wM-MCk5HSjackzuqHcjdo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.python.org/issue31530", "ref_desc": "Issue 31530: CVE-2018-1000030: Python 2.7 readahead feature of file objects is not thread safe - Python trackerIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02", "ref_desc": "Python: Buffer overflow (GLSA 201811-02) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0", "ref_desc": "Dropbox - Python Bug - Simplify your lifePermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view", "ref_desc": "Python Use-After-Free Description.pdf - Google DriveThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-3817-1: Python vulnerabilities | Ubuntu security noticesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZmwBBf3temIPusl4YHtQGBA6V8Y.html"}]}
