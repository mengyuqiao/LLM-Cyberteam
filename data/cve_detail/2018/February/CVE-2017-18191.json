{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-18191", "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Nova 15.x through 15.1.0 and 16.x through 16.1.1. By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume, an attacker may access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the LUKS header, resulting in a denial of service attack on the compute host. (The same code error also results in data loss, but that is not a vulnerability because the user loses their own data.) All Nova setups supporting encrypted volumes are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18191", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenstack\u00bbVersion:10cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openstack:10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbOpenstack\u00bbVersion:9cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openstack:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbOpenstack\u00bbVersion:12cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openstack:12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbNovaVersions  from including (>=) 16.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 16.1.1cpe:2.3:a:openstack:nova:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbNovaVersions  from including (>=) 15.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.1.0cpe:2.3:a:openstack:nova:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.47%  +0.16 \n 2  2024-12-10  0.30%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-13  0.42%  0.30%  -0.13 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.18%  0.42%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2714", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:2714 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/04/20/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [OSSA-2018-001] Raw underlying encrypted volume access (CVE-2017-18191)Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2855", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:2855 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2018-001.html", "ref_desc": "OpenStack Docs: OSSA-2018-001: Raw underlying encrypted volume accessPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2332", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:2332 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103104", "ref_desc": "OpenStack Nova CVE-2017-18191 Local Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1739593", "ref_desc": "Bug #1739593 \u201c[OSSA-2018-001] Swapping encrypted volumes can lea...\u201d : Bugs : OpenStack Compute (nova)Exploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://review.openstack.org/539893", "ref_desc": "Change I43abe5ca: Adds OSSA-2018-001 (CVE-2017-18191) | review.opendev Code ReviewExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
