{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-8742", "Description": "The Windows installer that the Apache CouchDB team provides was vulnerable to local privilege escalation. All files in the install inherit the file permissions of the parent directory and therefore a non-privileged user can substitute any executable for the nssm.exe service launcher, or CouchDB batch or binary files. A subsequent service or server restart will then run that binary with administrator privilege. This issue affected CouchDB 2.0.0 (Windows platform only) and was addressed in CouchDB 2.0.0.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8742", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCouchdb\u00bbVersion:2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:couchdb:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  2.41%  0.06%  -2.35 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40865/", "ref_desc": "Apache CouchDB 2.0.0 - Local Privilege EscalationThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/couchdb-dev/201612.mbox/%3C825F65E1-0E5F-4E1F-8053-CF2C6200C526%40apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2016-8742 Apache CouchDB local privilege escalation on WindowsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94766", "ref_desc": "Apache CouchDB CVE-2016-8742 Local Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
