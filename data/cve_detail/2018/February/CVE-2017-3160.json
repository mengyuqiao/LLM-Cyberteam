{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-3160", "Description": "After the Android platform is added to Cordova the first time, or after a project is created using the build scripts, the scripts will fetch Gradle on the first build. However, since the default URI is not using https, it is vulnerable to a MiTM and the Gradle executable is not safe. The severity of this issue is high due to the fact that the build scripts immediately start a build after Gradle has been fetched. Developers who are concerned about this issue should install version 6.1.2 or higher of Cordova-Android. If developers are unable to install the latest version, this vulnerability can easily be mitigated by setting the CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL environment variable to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3160", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCordova\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 6.1.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:cordova:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-06-25  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6OJkLQsxDUx0t4HrHXsIXBu1xGs.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95838", "ref_desc": "Apache Cordova For Android CVE-2017-3160 Man in the Middle Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2017/01/27/android-612.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Cordova Android 6.1.2 Released - Apache CordovaMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
