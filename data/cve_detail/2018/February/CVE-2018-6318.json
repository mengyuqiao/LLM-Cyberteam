{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6318", "Description": "In Sophos Tester Tool 3.2.0.7 Beta, the driver loads (in the context of the application used to test an exploit or ransomware) the DLL using a payload that runs from NTDLL.DLL (so, it's run in userland), but the driver doesn't perform any validation of this DLL (not its signature, not its hash, etc.). A person can change this DLL in a local way, or with a remote connection, to a malicious DLL with the same name -- and when the product is used, this malicious DLL will be loaded, aka a DLL Hijacking attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6318", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nSophos\u00bbSophos Tester\u00bbVersion:3.2.0.7UpdateBetacpe:2.3:a:sophos:sophos_tester:3.2.0.7:beta:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-15  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://29wspy.ru/exploits/CVE-2018-6318.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
