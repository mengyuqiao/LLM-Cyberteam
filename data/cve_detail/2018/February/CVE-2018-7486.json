{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7486", "Description": "Blue River Mura CMS before v7.0.7029 supports inline function calls with an [m] tag and [/m] end tag, without proper restrictions on file types or pathnames, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an [m]$.dspinclude(\"../pathname/executable.jpeg\")[/m] approach, where executable.jpeg contains ColdFusion Markup Language code. This can be exploited in conjunction with a CKFinder feature that allows file upload.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7486", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nBlueriver\u00bbMuracmsVersions  before (<) 7.0.7029cpe:2.3:a:blueriver:muracms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.62%  +0.25 \n 2  2024-09-29  0.37%  0.36%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.37%  0.37%  0.00 \n 4  2024-04-23  0.38%  0.37%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-01-06  0.37%  0.38%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-12  0.54%  0.37%  -0.17 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.70%  0.54%  -1.16 \n 8  2023-01-22  1.56%  1.70%  +0.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://bekhzod0725.github.io/cybersecurity/2018/02/16/exploiting-muracms.html", "ref_desc": "Exploiting MuraCMSExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
