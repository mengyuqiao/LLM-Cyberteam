{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-7482", "Description": "The K2 component 2.8.0 for Joomla! has Incorrect Access Control with directory traversal, allowing an attacker to download arbitrary files, as demonstrated by a view=media&task=connector&cmd=file&target=l1_../configuration.php&download=1 request. The specific pathname ../configuration.php should be base64 encoded for a valid attack. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because only files under the media-manager path can be downloaded, and the documentation indicates that sensitive information does not belong there. Nonetheless, 2.8.1 has additional blocking of .php downloads", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7482", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nJoomlaworks\u00bbK2\u00bbVersion:2.8.0ForJoomla!cpe:2.3:a:joomlaworks:k2:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:joomla\\!:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-08  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.26%  0.16%  -0.10 \n 3  2023-05-05  0.37%  0.26%  -0.11 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.37%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.joomlaworks.net/forum/forum-updates-other-resources/49046-false-cve-report-on-k2-v2-8-0", "ref_desc": "False CVE report on K2 v2.8.0 - Community Forum - JoomlaWorksVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://exploit-db.com/exploits/44188", "ref_desc": "404 Page Not Found | Exploit DatabaseBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
