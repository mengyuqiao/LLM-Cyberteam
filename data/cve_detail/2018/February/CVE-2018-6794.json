{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6794", "Description": "Suricata before 4.0.4 is prone to an HTTP detection bypass vulnerability in detect.c and stream-tcp.c. If a malicious server breaks a normal TCP flow and sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete, then the data sent by the malicious server will be accepted by web clients such as a web browser or Linux CLI utilities, but ignored by Suricata IDS signatures. This mostly affects IDS signatures for the HTTP protocol and TCP stream content; signatures for TCP packets will inspect such network traffic as usual.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6794", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSuricata-ids\u00bbSuricataVersions  before (<) 4.0.4cpe:2.3:a:suricata-ids:suricata:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "23.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  59.67%  23.48%  -36.20 \n 2  2023-07-01  64.47%  59.67%  -4.79 \n 3  2023-05-19  76.08%  64.47%  -11.62 \n 4  2023-05-08  71.52%  76.08%  +4.57 \n 5  2023-03-27  84.11%  71.52%  -12.60 \n 6  2023-03-08  88.65%  84.11%  -4.54 \n 7  2023-03-07  8.94%  88.65%  +79.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/pull/3202/commits/e1ef57c848bbe4e567d5d4b66d346a742e3f77a1", "ref_desc": "Next/20180129/v13 by victorjulien \u00b7 Pull Request #3202 \u00b7 OISF/suricata \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://suricata-ids.org/2018/02/14/suricata-4-0-4-available/", "ref_desc": "Suricata 4.0.4 available! | SuricataVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/12/msg00000.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1603-1] suricata security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dZ9EA1h4zuDAYFdA3s61u1ieh2k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44247/", "ref_desc": "Suricata < 4.0.4 - IDS Detection BypassExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/2427", "ref_desc": "Bug #2427: Suricata 3.x.x and 4.x.x do not parse HTTP responses if tcp data was sent before 3-way-handshake completed - Suricata - Open Information Security FoundationThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
