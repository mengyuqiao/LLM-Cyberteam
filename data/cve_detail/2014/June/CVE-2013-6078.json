{"CVE Code": "CVE-2013-6078", "Description": "The default configuration of EMC RSA BSAFE Toolkits and RSA Data Protection Manager (DPM) 20130918 uses the Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging unspecified \"security concerns,\" aka the ESA-2013-068 issue.  NOTE: this issue has been SPLIT from CVE-2007-6755 because the vendor announcement did not state a specific technical rationale for a change in the algorithm; thus, CVE cannot reach a conclusion that a CVE-2007-6755 concern was the reason, or one of the reasons, for this change.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-6078", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEMC\u00bbRsa Bsafe Toolkits\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:emc:rsa_bsafe_toolkits:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEMC\u00bbRsa Data Protection Manager\u00bbVersion:20130918cpe:2.3:a:emc:rsa_data_protection_manager:20130918:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.15%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-310", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/310/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/rsa-warns-developers-against-its-own.html", "ref_desc": "RSA warns developers not to use RSA products \u2013 A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic EngineeringCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fq8vvB5q9Vu-XAMMrVtNbGrVYnU.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/stop-using-nsa-influence-code-in-our-product-rsa-tells-customers/", "ref_desc": "Stop using NSA-influenced code in our products, RSA tells customers | Ars TechnicaCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jNwyogBdoN7J9Qu9n0_pU2FwSUE.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://stream.wsj.com/story/latest-headlines/SS-2-63399/SS-2-332655/", "ref_desc": "The Wall Street Journal & Breaking News, Business, Financial and Economic News, World News and VideoCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lXLe-TM6r-89dS1SqcBAMcK2p2w.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://threatpost.com/in-wake-of-latest-crypto-revelations-everything-is-suspect", "ref_desc": "In Wake of Latest Crypto Revelations, \u2018Everything is Suspect\u2019 | ThreatpostCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Vkozo_XQx4XxQ19zzaPydaJXm7Q.html"}]}
