{"CVE Code": "CVE-2014-4192", "Description": "The Dual_EC_DRBG implementation in EMC RSA BSAFE-C Toolkits (aka Share for C and C++) processes certain requests for output bytes by considering only the requested byte count and not the use of cached bytes, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain plaintext from TLS sessions by recovering the algorithm's inner state, a different issue than CVE-2007-6755.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-4192", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbBsafe Share\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:dell:bsafe_share:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-17  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-05-10  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.24%  0.14%  -0.10 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.24%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-310", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/310/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://dualec.org/", "ref_desc": "On the Practical Exploitability of Dual EC in TLS ImplementationsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/c7mC9vmmWmAmED-HRwO_YJ-dql8.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://dualec.org/DualECTLS.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YKHCOF7IFZk6LDkBK5a8qIW4i1w.html"}]}
