{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39210", "Description": "GLPI is a free Asset and IT management software package. In versions prior to 9.5.6, the cookie used to store the autologin cookie (when a user uses the \"remember me\" feature) is accessible by scripts. A malicious plugin that could steal this cookie would be able to use it to autologin. This issue is fixed in version 9.5.6. As a workaround, one may avoid using the \"remember me\" feature.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39210", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpiVersions  before (<) 9.5.6cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.69%  0.33%  -0.36 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.33%  0.69%  +0.36 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.33%  +0.23 \n 4  2023-08-02  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-04-08  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1004 Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1004/Sensitive-Cookie-Without-HttpOnly-Flag.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/b2e99a41-b904-419f-a274-ae383e4925f2/", "ref_desc": "huntr: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag PHP Vulnerability in glpiThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-hwxq-4c5f-m4v2", "ref_desc": "Autologin cookie accessible by scripts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/tag/9.5.6", "ref_desc": "Release 9.5.6 \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Uscqd1K5RWFCZPAt5igZ1Q5TTQY.html"}]}
