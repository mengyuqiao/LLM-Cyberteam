{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41616", "Description": "Apache DB DdlUtils 1.0 included a BinaryObjectsHelper that was intended for use when migrating database data with a SQL data type of BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, or BLOB between databases using the ddlutils features. The BinaryObjectsHelper class was insecure and used ObjectInputStream.readObject without validating that the input data was safe to deserialize. Please note that DdlUtils is no longer being actively developed. To address the insecurity of the BinaryObjectHelper class, the following changes to DdlUtils have been made: (1) BinaryObjectsHelper.java has been deleted from the DdlUtils source repository and the DdlUtils feature of propagating data of SQL binary types is therefore no longer present in DdlUtils; (2) The ddlutils-1.0 release has been removed from the Apache Release Distribution Infrastructure; (3) The DdlUtils web site has been updated to indicate that DdlUtils is now available only as source code, not as a packaged release.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41616", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbDdlutils\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:ddlutils:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.67%  1.19%  +0.53 \n 2  2025-05-25  2.42%  0.67%  -1.76 \n 3  2025-03-30  4.72%  2.42%  -2.30 \n 4  2025-03-29  2.42%  4.72%  +2.30 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.29%  2.42%  +2.13 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.58%  0.29%  -0.29 \n 7  2024-10-17  0.64%  0.58%  -0.06 \n 8  2024-08-22  9.24%  0.64%  -8.60 \n 9  2024-07-26  21.85%  9.24%  -12.61 \n 10  2024-06-15  25.60%  21.85%  -3.75 \n 11  2024-05-06  31.94%  25.60%  -6.34 \n 12  2023-08-30  25.28%  31.94%  +6.66 \n 13  2023-04-23  19.59%  25.28%  +5.69 \n 14  2023-03-13  11.33%  19.59%  +8.26 \n 15  2023-03-07  0.89%  11.33%  +10.45 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r3d7a8303a820144f5e2d1fd0b067e18d419421b58346b53b58d3fa72%40%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-41616: Apache ddlutils 1.0 readobject vulnerability - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
