{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39187", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39187", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.10.3cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.79%  0.66%  -0.13 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.66%  0.79%  +0.13 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.23%  0.66%  +0.43 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.23%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-05-18  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-04-08  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 7  2024-03-13  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-04-24  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-04-10  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-26  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3463", "ref_desc": "[NODE-3463] Cannot catch exception with useUnifiedTopology - MongoDB JiraPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xqp8-w826-hh6x", "ref_desc": "Server crashes with invalid explain query parameter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/308668c89474223e2448be92d6823b52c1c313ec", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xqp8-w826-hh6x \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@308668c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/4.10.3", "ref_desc": "Release 4.10.3 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
