{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39229", "Description": "Apprise is an open source library which allows you to send a notification to almost all of the most popular notification services available. In affected versions users who use Apprise granting them access to the IFTTT plugin (which just comes out of the box) are subject to a denial of service attack on an inefficient regular expression. The vulnerable regular expression is [here](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/blob/0007eade20934ddef0aba38b8f1aad980cfff253/apprise/plugins/NotifyIFTTT.py#L356-L359). The problem has been patched in release version 0.9.5.1. Users who are unable to upgrade are advised to remove `apprise/plugins/NotifyIFTTT.py` to eliminate the service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39229", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNuxref\u00bbAppriseVersions  before (<) 0.9.5.1cpe:2.3:a:nuxref:apprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.53%  0.45%  -0.09 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.45%  0.53%  +0.09 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.41%  0.45%  +0.04 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.20%  0.41%  +0.20 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.20%  -0.04 \n 6  2024-06-05  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-04-26  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-12-13  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-05-12  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-04-28  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-04-13  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/caronc/apprise/security/advisories/GHSA-qhmp-h54x-38qr", "ref_desc": "CWE-730 Regex injection with IFTTT Plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 caronc/apprise \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/caronc/apprise/pull/436", "ref_desc": "Slight bulletproofing to IFTTT regex handling by caronc \u00b7 Pull Request #436 \u00b7 caronc/apprise \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/caronc/apprise/blob/0007eade20934ddef0aba38b8f1aad980cfff253/apprise/plugins/NotifyIFTTT.py#L356-L359", "ref_desc": "apprise/NotifyIFTTT.py at 0007eade20934ddef0aba38b8f1aad980cfff253 \u00b7 caronc/apprise \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
