{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36219", "Description": "An issue was discovered in SKALE sgxwallet 1.58.3. The provided input for ECALL 14 triggers a branch in trustedEcdsaSign that frees a non-initialized pointer from the stack. An attacker can chain multiple enclave calls to prepare a stack that contains a valid address. This address is then freed, resulting in compromised integrity of the enclave. This was resolved after v1.58.3 and not reproducible in sgxwallet v1.77.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36219", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSkale\u00bbSgxwallet\u00bbVersion:1.58.3cpe:2.3:a:skale:sgxwallet:1.58.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.05%  0.50%  -0.55 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.50%  1.05%  +0.55 \n 3  2025-03-23  0.48%  0.50%  +0.03 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.22%  0.48%  +0.26 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.22%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-06-12  0.21%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-04-20  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-10  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/824/Access-of-Uninitialized-Pointer.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 skalenetwork/sgxwallet \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-Hp891QI2qu-Hu_QrW20cKzWCP4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/commit/4e9b5b7526db083177e81f8bafeaa4914d276a82", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'develop' into SKALE-1180-VERIFY-ECDSA \u00b7 skalenetwork/sgxwallet@4e9b5b7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
