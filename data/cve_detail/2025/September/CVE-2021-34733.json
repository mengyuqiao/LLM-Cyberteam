{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34733", "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information stored on the underlying file system of an affected system. This vulnerability exists because sensitive information is not sufficiently secured when it is stored. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create forged authentication requests and gain unauthorized access to the affected system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34733", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.8cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEvolved Programmable Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 5.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:evolved_programmable_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.09%  0.05%  -0.05 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.09%  +0.05 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-prime-info-disc-nTU9FJ2", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
