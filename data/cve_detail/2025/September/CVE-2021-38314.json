{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-38314", "Description": "The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress registered several AJAX actions available to unauthenticated users in the `includes` function in `redux-core/class-redux-core.php` that were unique to a given site but deterministic and predictable given that they were based on an md5 hash of the site URL with a known salt value of '-redux' and an md5 hash of the previous hash with a known salt value of '-support'. These AJAX actions could be used to retrieve a list of active plugins and their versions, the site's PHP version, and an unsalted md5 hash of site\u2019s `AUTH_KEY` concatenated with the `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38314", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nRedux\u00bbGutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.11cpe:2.3:a:redux:gutenberg_template_library_\\&_redux_framework:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "86.72% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  87.20%  86.72%  -0.48 \n 2  2025-06-01  86.72%  87.20%  +0.48 \n 3  2025-05-04  87.20%  86.72%  -0.48 \n 4  2025-05-01  86.72%  87.20%  +0.48 \n 5  2025-03-25  84.83%  86.72%  +1.89 \n 6  2025-03-23  85.58%  84.83%  -0.74 \n 7  2025-03-20  84.83%  85.58%  +0.74 \n 8  2025-03-17  0.19%  84.83%  +84.64 \n 9  2025-02-05  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 10  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.15%  -0.02 \n 11  2024-09-04  0.20%  0.17%  -0.03 \n 12  2024-05-17  0.13%  0.20%  +0.07 \n 13  2024-04-21  0.16%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 14  2024-02-02  0.15%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 15  2023-07-15  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 16  2023-07-08  0.18%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 17  2023-05-08  0.16%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 18  2023-03-26  0.19%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 19  2023-03-13  0.22%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 20  2023-03-07  8.59%  0.22%  -8.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-760 Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/760/Use-of-a-One-Way-Hash-with-a-Predictable-Salt.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/09/over-1-million-sites-affected-by-redux-framework-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "Over 1 Million Sites Affected by Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework VulnerabilitiesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NE_fVrKQmldGbMUc-EpssN-GoC8.html"}]}
