{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41104", "Description": "ESPHome is a system to control the ESP8266/ESP32. Anyone with web_server enabled and HTTP basic auth configured on version 2021.9.1 or older is vulnerable to an issue in which `web_server` allows over-the-air (OTA) updates without checking user defined basic auth username & password. This issue is patched in version 2021.9.2. As a workaround, one may disable or remove `web_server`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41104", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEsphome\u00bbEsphome FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2021.9.2cpe:2.3:o:esphome:esphome_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Espressif\u00bbEsp32\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Espressif\u00bbEsp8266\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.34%  0.28%  -0.05 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.28%  0.34%  +0.05 \n 3  2025-03-24  0.27%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.27%  +0.15 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-06-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-05-04  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-04-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-04-21  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-03-11  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/esphome/esphome/releases/tag/2021.9.2", "ref_desc": "Release 2021.9.2 \u00b7 esphome/esphome \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/esphome/esphome/security/advisories/GHSA-48mj-p7x2-5jfm", "ref_desc": "web_server allows OTA update without checking user defined basic auth username & password \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 esphome/esphome \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/2409/commits/207cde1667d8c799a197b78ca8a5a14de8d5ca1e", "ref_desc": "Fix lint issues in web_server_base by jesserockz \u00b7 Pull Request #2409 \u00b7 esphome/esphome \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
