{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40524", "Description": "In Pure-FTPd before 1.0.50, an incorrect max_filesize quota mechanism in the server allows attackers to upload files of unbounded size, which may lead to denial of service or a server hang. This occurs because a certain greater-than-zero test does not anticipate an initial -1 value. (Versions 1.0.23 through 1.0.49 are affected.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40524", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPureftpd\u00bbPure-ftpdVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.23andbefore (<) 1.0.50cpe:2.3:a:pureftpd:pure-ftpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.88%  0.57%  -0.31 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.57%  0.88%  +0.31 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.58%  0.57%  -0.01 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.23%  0.58%  +0.36 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.23%  -0.04 \n 6  2024-04-11  0.23%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-11-28  0.18%  0.23%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-04-27  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-04-13  0.13%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-03-29  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jedisct1/pure-ftpd/compare/1.0.49...1.0.50", "ref_desc": "Comparing 1.0.49...1.0.50 \u00b7 jedisct1/pure-ftpd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jedisct1/pure-ftpd/pull/158", "ref_desc": "fix the maxfile_size checking bug by DroidTest \u00b7 Pull Request #158 \u00b7 jedisct1/pure-ftpd \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jedisct1/pure-ftpd/commit/37ad222868e52271905b94afea4fc780d83294b4", "ref_desc": "Initialize the max upload file size when quotas are enabled \u00b7 jedisct1/pure-ftpd@37ad222 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
