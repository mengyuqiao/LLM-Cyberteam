{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33484", "Description": "An issue was discovered in CommentsService.ashx in OnyakTech Comments Pro 3.8. An attacker can download a copy of the installer, decompile it, and discover a hardcoded IV used to encrypt the username and userid in the comment POST request. Additionally, the attacker can decrypt the encrypted encryption key (sent as a parameter in the comment form request) by setting this encrypted value as the username, which will appear on the comment page in its decrypted form. Using these two values (combined with the encryption functionality discovered in the decompiled installer), the attacker can encrypt another user's ID and username. These values can be used as part of the comment posting request in order to spoof the user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33484", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOnyaktech Comments Pro Project\u00bbOnyaktech Comments Pro\u00bbVersion:3.8cpe:2.3:a:onyaktech_comments_pro_project:onyaktech_comments_pro:3.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.30%  0.16%  -0.15 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.16%  0.30%  +0.15 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.22%  0.16%  -0.06 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.22%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-07-30  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 6  2024-05-23  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-04-13  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-31  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/onyaktech", "ref_desc": "OnyakTech (@OnyakTech) / TwitterThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q80izYsdRWkMjTUOF3dsOO6VtvI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2021/07/onyaktech-comments-pro-broken.html", "ref_desc": "Burninator Sec: OnyakTech Comments Pro - Broken Encryption and XSS CVE-2021-33484 and CVE-2021-33483Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vI6s4DLLfSSzIEc2vYBhhhlq2Xk.html"}]}
