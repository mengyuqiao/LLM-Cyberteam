{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36286", "Description": "Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36286", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbSupportassist Client ConsumerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.9.13.0cpe:2.3:a:dell:supportassist_client_consumer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.11%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.11%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000191057/dsa-2021-163-dell-supportassist-client-consumer-security-update-for-two-vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "DSA-2021-163: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer Security Update for Two Vulnerabilities. | Dell NederlandPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/K5anIQ75DfPhCU2aCYP78Op3Dr8.html"}]}
