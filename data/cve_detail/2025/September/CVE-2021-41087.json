{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41087", "Description": "in-toto-golang is a go implementation of the in-toto framework to protect software supply chain integrity. In affected versions authenticated attackers posing as functionaries (i.e., within a trusted set of users for a layout) are able to create attestations that may bypass DISALLOW rules in the same layout. An attacker with access to trusted private keys, may issue an attestation that contains a disallowed artifact by including path traversal semantics (e.g., foo vs dir/../foo). Exploiting this vulnerability is dependent on the specific policy applied. The problem has been fixed in version 0.3.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41087", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nIn-toto\u00bbIn-toto-golangVersions  before (<) 0.3.0cpe:2.3:a:in-toto:in-toto-golang:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.17%  0.15%  -0.02 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.17%  +0.11 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/commit/f2c57d1e0f15e3ffbeac531829c696b72ecc4290", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vrxp-mg9f-hwf3 \u00b7 in-toto/in-toto-golang@f2c57d1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/security/advisories/GHSA-vrxp-mg9f-hwf3", "ref_desc": "Improperly Implemented path matching for in-toto-golang \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 in-toto/in-toto-golang \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
