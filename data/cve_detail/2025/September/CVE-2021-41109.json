{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41109", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41109", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.10.4cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.70%  0.36%  -0.34 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.36%  0.70%  +0.34 \n 3  2025-03-26  0.34%  0.36%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.19%  0.34%  +0.16 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.19%  +0.05 \n 6  2024-06-15  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-05-06  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-04-10  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-04-23  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-03-13  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/4.10.4", "ref_desc": "Release 4.10.4 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/4ac4b7f71002ed4fbedbb901db1f6ed1e9ac5559", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7pr3-p5fm-8r9x \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@4ac4b7f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-7pr3-p5fm-8r9x", "ref_desc": "LiveQuery publishes user session tokens \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
