{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41034", "Description": "The build of some language stacks of Eclipse Che version 6 includes pulling some binaries from an unsecured HTTP endpoint. As a consequence the builds of such stacks are vulnerable to MITM attacks that allow the replacement of the original binaries with arbitrary ones. The stacks involved are Java 8 (alpine and centos), Android and PHP. The vulnerability is not exploitable at runtime but only when building Che.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41034", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbCHEVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.0cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:che:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.16%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.20%  0.16%  -0.05 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.13%  0.20%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-06-14  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 5  2024-05-05  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 6  2023-04-22  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-924 Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/924/Improper-Enforcement-of-Message-Integrity-During-Transmissio.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=540989", "ref_desc": "540989 \u2013 (CVE-2021-41034) Che build incorporates binaries downloaded over http -- potential MITM risk.Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
