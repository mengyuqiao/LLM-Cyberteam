{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37629", "Description": "Nextcloud Richdocuments is an open source collaborative office suite. In affected versions there is a lack of rate limiting on the Richdocuments OCS endpoint. This may have allowed an attacker to enumerate potentially valid share tokens. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Richdocuments app is upgraded to either 3.8.4 or 4.2.1 to resolve. For users unable to upgrade it is recommended that the Richdocuments application be disabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37629", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbRichdocumentsVersions  before (<) 3.8.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:richdocuments:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbRichdocumentsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.1cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:richdocuments:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.30%  0.38%  +0.09 \n 2  2025-06-01  0.38%  0.30%  -0.09 \n 3  2025-05-04  0.30%  0.38%  +0.09 \n 4  2025-05-01  0.38%  0.30%  -0.09 \n 5  2025-04-30  0.41%  0.38%  -0.03 \n 6  2025-04-13  0.30%  0.41%  +0.11 \n 7  2025-04-12  0.41%  0.30%  -0.11 \n 8  2025-04-02  0.30%  0.41%  +0.11 \n 9  2025-04-01  0.41%  0.30%  -0.11 \n 10  2025-03-30  0.35%  0.41%  +0.06 \n 11  2025-03-29  0.41%  0.35%  -0.06 \n 12  2025-03-28  0.30%  0.41%  +0.11 \n 13  2025-03-27  0.41%  0.30%  -0.11 \n 14  2025-03-25  0.30%  0.41%  +0.11 \n 15  2025-03-24  0.39%  0.30%  -0.09 \n 16  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.39%  +0.27 \n 17  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 18  2024-05-23  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 19  2024-04-13  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 20  2024-03-18  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 21  2023-03-31  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 22  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/richdocuments/pull/1663", "ref_desc": "Throttle on invalid share tokens by LukasReschke \u00b7 Pull Request #1663 \u00b7 nextcloud/richdocuments \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1258750", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-gvvr-h36p-8mjx", "ref_desc": "Lack of ratelimit on Richdocuments OCS endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
