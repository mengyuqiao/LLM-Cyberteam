{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41083", "Description": "Dada Mail is a web-based e-mail list management system. In affected versions a bad actor could give someone a carefully crafted web page via email, SMS, etc, that - when visited, allows them control of the list control panel as if the bad actor was logged in themselves. This includes changing any mailing list password, as well as the Dada Mail Root Password - which could effectively shut out actual list owners of the mailing list and allow the bad actor complete and unfettered control of your mailing list. This vulnerability also affects profile logins. For this vulnerability to work, the target of the bad actor would need to be logged into the list control panel themselves. This CSRF vulnerability in Dada Mail affects all versions of Dada Mail v11.15.1 and below. Although we know of no known CSRF exploits that have happened in the wild, this vulnerability has been confirmed by our testing, and by a third party. Users are advised to update to version 11.16.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41083", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nDadamailproject\u00bbDada MailVersions  before (<) 11.16.0cpe:2.3:a:dadamailproject:dada_mail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.17%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-06-05  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 5  2023-04-13  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/commit/d4d3d86d08c816b4da75a5ef45abc12188772459", "ref_desc": "This adds CSRF protection to the profiles. \u00b7 justingit/dada-mail@d4d3d86 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/security/advisories/GHSA-344m-p829-2r38", "ref_desc": "CSRF Vulnerabilities Found in versions 11.15.1 and below \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 justingit/dada-mail \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
