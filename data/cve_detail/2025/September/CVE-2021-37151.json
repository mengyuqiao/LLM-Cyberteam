{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37151", "Description": "CyberArk Identity 21.5.131, when handling an invalid authentication attempt, sometimes reveals whether the username is valid. In certain authentication policy configurations with MFA, the API response length can be used to differentiate between a valid user and an invalid one (aka Username Enumeration). Response differentiation enables attackers to enumerate usernames of valid application users. Attackers can use this information to leverage brute-force and dictionary attacks in order to discover valid account information such as passwords.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37151", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCyberark\u00bbIdentityVersions  before (<) 21.11.133cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:identity:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.27%  0.23%  -0.04 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.23%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.23%  +0.14 \n 4  2024-05-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-07  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cyberark.com/products/", "ref_desc": "Identity Security Platform Solutions | CyberArkProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gov.il/en/departments/faq/cve_advisories", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/R1tD4TSH1Vu0JGFzV5ebbWHjSb4.html"}]}
