{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40523", "Description": "In Contiki 3.0, Telnet option negotiation is mishandled. During negotiation between a server and a client, the server may fail to give the WILL/WONT or DO/DONT response for DO and WILL commands because of improper handling of exception condition, which leads to property violations and denial of service. Specifically, a server sometimes sends no response, because a fixed buffer space is available for all responses and that space may have been exhausted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40523", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-os\u00bbContiki\u00bbVersion:3.0cpe:2.3:o:contiki-os:contiki:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.40%  0.33%  -0.06 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.33%  0.40%  +0.06 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.33%  +0.24 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-05-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-04-11  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-29  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/issues/2686", "ref_desc": "Incorrectly handling negotiated options of telnet servers \u00b7 Issue #2686 \u00b7 contiki-os/contiki \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
