{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41077", "Description": "The activation process in Travis CI, for certain 2021-09-03 through 2021-09-10 builds, causes secret data to have unexpected sharing that is not specified by the customer-controlled .travis.yml file. In particular, the desired behavior (if .travis.yml has been created locally by a customer, and added to git) is for a Travis service to perform builds in a way that prevents public access to customer-specific secret environment data such as signing keys, access credentials, and API tokens. However, during the stated 8-day interval, secret data could be revealed to an unauthorized actor who forked a public repository and printed files during a build process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41077", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTravis-ci\u00bbTravis CiVersions  from including (>=) 2021-09-03andup to, including, (<=) 2021-09-10cpe:2.3:a:travis-ci:travis_ci:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.43% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.84%  0.43%  -0.41 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.43%  0.84%  +0.41 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.42%  0.43%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.42%  +0.17 \n 5  2024-11-15  0.17%  0.25%  +0.07 \n 6  2024-05-30  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-04-20  0.15%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-03-25  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-04-07  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.14%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28524727", "ref_desc": "Secure env vars of all public travisci repositories were injected into PR builds | Hacker NewsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1437646118700175360", "ref_desc": "P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) on Twitter: \"Between the 3 Sept and 10 Sept, secure env vars of *all* public @travisci repositories were injected into PR builds.
