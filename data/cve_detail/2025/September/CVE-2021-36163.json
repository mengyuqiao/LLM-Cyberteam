{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36163", "Description": "In Apache Dubbo, users may choose to use the Hessian protocol. The Hessian protocol is implemented on top of HTTP and passes the body of a POST request directly to a HessianSkeleton: New HessianSkeleton are created without any configuration of the serialization factory and therefore without applying the dubbo properties for applying allowed or blocked type lists. In addition, the generic service is always exposed and therefore attackers do not need to figure out a valid service/method name pair. This is fixed in 2.7.13, 2.6.10.1", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36163", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbDubboVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.7.12cpe:2.3:a:apache:dubbo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbDubboVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:dubbo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-21  1.43%  1.28%  -0.15 \n 2  2025-03-30  2.74%  1.43%  -1.31 \n 3  2025-03-29  1.43%  2.74%  +1.31 \n 4  2025-03-24  1.65%  1.43%  -0.22 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.29%  1.65%  +1.37 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.58%  0.29%  -0.29 \n 7  2024-09-24  0.64%  0.58%  -0.06 \n 8  2024-07-30  9.24%  0.64%  -8.60 \n 9  2024-07-03  21.85%  9.24%  -12.61 \n 10  2024-05-23  25.60%  21.85%  -3.75 \n 11  2024-04-13  31.94%  25.60%  -6.34 \n 12  2023-08-07  25.28%  31.94%  +6.66 \n 13  2023-03-31  19.54%  25.28%  +5.74 \n 14  2023-03-07  0.89%  19.54%  +18.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8d0adc057bb15a37199502cc366f4b1164c9c536ce28e4defdb428c0%40%3Cdev.dubbo.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2021-36163] Unsafe deserialization in providers using Hessian protocol - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
