{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41097", "Description": "aurelia-path is part of the Aurelia platform and contains utilities for path manipulation. There is a prototype pollution vulnerability in aurelia-path before version 1.1.7. The vulnerability exposes Aurelia application that uses `aurelia-path` package to parse a string. The majority of this will be Aurelia applications that employ the `aurelia-router` package. An example is this could allow an attacker to change the prototype of base object class `Object` by tricking an application to parse the following URL: `https://aurelia.io/blog/?__proto__[asdf]=asdf`. The problem is patched in version `1.1.7`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41097", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBluespire\u00bbAurelia-path\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.1.7cpe:2.3:a:bluespire:aurelia-path:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-13  0.43%  0.34%  -0.09 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.89%  0.43%  -0.47 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.43%  0.89%  +0.47 \n 4  2025-03-23  0.41%  0.43%  +0.02 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.28%  0.41%  +0.13 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-06-12  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 8  2024-05-03  0.18%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-12-20  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-04-20  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aurelia/path/security/advisories/GHSA-3c9c-2p65-qvwv", "ref_desc": "Prototype pollution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aurelia/path \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aurelia/path/releases/tag/1.1.7", "ref_desc": "Release 1.1.7 \u00b7 aurelia/path \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aurelia/path/commit/7c4e235433a4a2df9acc313fbe891758084fdec1", "ref_desc": "fix: security issue gh closes #44 \u00b7 aurelia/path@7c4e235 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/aurelia-path", "ref_desc": "aurelia-path - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aurelia/path/issues/44", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution \u00b7 Issue #44 \u00b7 aurelia/path \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
