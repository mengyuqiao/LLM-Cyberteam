{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41380", "Description": "RealVNC Viewer 6.21.406 allows remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted RFB protocol data. NOTE: It is asserted that this issue requires social engineering a user into connecting to a fake VNC Server. The VNC Viewer application they are using will then hang, until terminated, but no memory leak occurs - the resources are freed once the hung process is terminated and the resource usage is constant during the hang. Only the process that is connected to the fake Server is affected. This is an application bug, not a security issue", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41380", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRealvnc\u00bbVnc Viewer\u00bbVersion:6.21.406cpe:2.3:a:realvnc:vnc_viewer:6.21.406:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.34%  0.29%  -0.05 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.29%  0.34%  +0.05 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.29%  +0.17 \n 4  2025-02-04  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-06-02  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-04-23  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-04-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/totaam/a90f2bb40f5b693ccec0ae903d021b03", "ref_desc": "denial of service via a crafted frame buffer update packet \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
