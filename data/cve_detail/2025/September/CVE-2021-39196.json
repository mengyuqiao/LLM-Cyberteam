{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39196", "Description": "pcapture is an open source dumpcap web service interface . In affected versions this vulnerability allows an authenticated but unprivileged user to use the REST API to capture and download packets with no capture filter and without adequate permissions. This is important because the capture filters can effectively limit the scope of information that a user can see in the data captures. If no filter is present, then all data on the local network segment where the program is running can be captured and downloaded. v3.12 fixes this problem. There is no workaround, you must upgrade to v3.12 or greater.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39196", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPcapture Project\u00bbPcaptureVersions  before (<) 3.12cpe:2.3:a:pcapture_project:pcapture:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.42%  0.22%  -0.20 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.22%  0.42%  +0.20 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.22%  +0.11 \n 4  2023-03-31  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jdhwpgmbca/pcapture/issues/7", "ref_desc": "findFilter() returning null for filter when invalid url_suffix used passed to user. \u00b7 Issue #7 \u00b7 jdhwpgmbca/pcapture \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jdhwpgmbca/pcapture/commit/0f74f431e0970a2e5784dbd955cfa4760e3b1ef7", "ref_desc": "Fixed major security bug. \u00b7 jdhwpgmbca/pcapture@0f74f43 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jdhwpgmbca/pcapture/security/advisories/GHSA-3r67-fxpr-p2qx", "ref_desc": "Authenticated non-privileged user can request unfiltered data without adequate permissions. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jdhwpgmbca/pcapture \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
