{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32766", "Description": "Nextcloud Text is an open source plaintext editing application which ships with the nextcloud server. In affected versions the Nextcloud Text application returned different error messages depending on whether a folder existed in a public link share. This is problematic in case the public link share has been created with \"Upload Only\" privileges. (aka \"File Drop\"). A link share recipient is not expected to see which folders or files exist in a \"File Drop\" share. Using this vulnerability an attacker is able to enumerate folders in such a share. Exploitation requires that the attacker has access to a valid affected \"File Drop\" link share. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.0.1. Users who are unable to upgrade are advised to disable the Nextcloud Text application in the app settings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32766", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 22.0.0andbefore (<) 22.1.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 20.0.12cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.0andbefore (<) 21.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.30%  0.38%  +0.09 \n 2  2025-06-01  0.38%  0.30%  -0.09 \n 3  2025-05-04  0.30%  0.38%  +0.09 \n 4  2025-05-01  0.38%  0.30%  -0.09 \n 5  2025-04-30  0.41%  0.38%  -0.03 \n 6  2025-04-19  0.30%  0.41%  +0.11 \n 7  2025-04-18  0.41%  0.30%  -0.11 \n 8  2025-04-17  0.30%  0.41%  +0.11 \n 9  2025-04-16  0.41%  0.30%  -0.11 \n 10  2025-04-10  0.30%  0.41%  +0.11 \n 11  2025-04-09  0.41%  0.30%  -0.11 \n 12  2025-04-02  0.30%  0.41%  +0.11 \n 13  2025-04-01  0.41%  0.30%  -0.11 \n 14  2025-03-30  0.49%  0.41%  -0.08 \n 15  2025-03-29  0.41%  0.49%  +0.08 \n 16  2025-03-24  0.39%  0.41%  +0.03 \n 17  2025-03-20  0.30%  0.39%  +0.09 \n 18  2025-03-18  0.39%  0.30%  -0.09 \n 19  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.39%  +0.27 \n 20  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 21  2024-05-23  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 22  2024-04-13  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 23  2024-03-18  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 24  2023-03-31  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 25  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-gcf3-3wmc-88jr", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud Text app can disclose existence of folders in \"File Drop\" link share \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1253475", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/text/pull/1716", "ref_desc": "Unify error responses and add logging where appropriate by juliushaertl \u00b7 Pull Request #1716 \u00b7 nextcloud/text \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
