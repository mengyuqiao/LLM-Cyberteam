{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39195", "Description": "Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in \"Upload from URL\" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39195", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nMisskey\u00bbMisskeyVersions  before (<) 12.90.0cpe:2.3:a:misskey:misskey:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.47%  0.24%  -0.23 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.24%  0.47%  +0.23 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.24%  +0.14 \n 4  2023-03-31  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#12900-20210904", "ref_desc": "misskey/CHANGELOG.md at develop \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-mqv7-gxh4-r5vf", "ref_desc": "Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability in download \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/e1a8b158e04ad567d92d8daf3cc0898ee18f1a2e", "ref_desc": "Tune download (#2) \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey@e1a8b15 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
