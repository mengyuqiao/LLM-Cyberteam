{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32805", "Description": "Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of Flask. In affected versions if using Flask-AppBuilder OAuth, an attacker can share a carefully crafted URL with a trusted domain for an application built with Flask-AppBuilder, this URL can redirect a user to a malicious site. This is an open redirect vulnerability. To resolve this issue upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.2.2 or above. If upgrading is infeasible users may filter HTTP traffic containing `?next={next-site}` where the `next-site` domain is different from the application you are protecting as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32805", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nDpgaspar\u00bbFlask-appbuilderVersions  before (<) 3.3.2cpe:2.3:a:dpgaspar:flask-appbuilder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.19%  0.17%  -0.02 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.19%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-05-24  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-04-14  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-01  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/security/advisories/GHSA-624f-cqvr-3qw4", "ref_desc": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in Flask-AppBuilder \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/commit/6af28521589599b1dbafd6313256229ee9a4fa74", "ref_desc": "fix: improve next URL on OAuth (#1668) \u00b7 dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder@6af2852 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
