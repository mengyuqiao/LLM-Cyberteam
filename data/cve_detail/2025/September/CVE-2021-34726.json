{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34726", "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and submitting crafted input to the CLI. The attacker must be authenticated as an administrative user to execute the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root-level privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34726", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 19.2.0andbefore (<) 19.2.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  before (<) 18.4.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 20.1andbefore (<) 20.1.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 20.4andbefore (<) 20.4.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 20.5andbefore (<) 20.5.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 20.3andbefore (<) 20.3.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.19%  0.15%  -0.04 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.20%  0.15%  -0.06 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.20%  +0.16 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-maapi-cmdinjec-znUYTuC", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN Software Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
