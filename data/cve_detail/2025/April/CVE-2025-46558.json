{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46558", "Description": "XWiki Contrib's Syntax Markdown allows importing Markdown content into wiki pages and creating wiki content in Markdown. In versions starting from 8.2 to before 8.9, the Markdown syntax is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) through HTML. In particular, using Markdown syntax, it's possible for any user to embed Javascript code that will then be executed on the browser of any other user visiting either the document or the comment that contains it. In the instance that this code is executed by a user with admins or programming rights, this issue compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in version 8.9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46558", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/MARKDOWN-80", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/syntax-markdown/security/advisories/GHSA-8g2j-rhfh-hq3r", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/syntax-markdown/commit/d136472d6e8a47981a0ede420a9096f88ffa5035", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
