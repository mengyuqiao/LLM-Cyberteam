{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46653", "Description": "Formidable (aka node-formidable) 2.1.0 through 3.x before 3.5.3 relies on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content; however, hexoid is documented as not \"cryptographically secure.\" (Also, there is a scenario in which only the last two characters of a hexoid string need to be guessed, but this is not often relevant.) NOTE: this does not imply that, in a typical use case, attackers will be able to exploit any hexoid behavior to upload and execute their own content.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46653", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-28  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-02  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/blob/d0fbec13edc8add54a1afb9ce1a8d3db803f8d47/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L10", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zast-ai/vulnerability-reports/blob/main/formidable/file_upload/report.md", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GlerzkfRmYAoEaqEMmiwKvg50eU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/commit/022c2c5577dfe14d2947f10909d81b03b6070bf5", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
