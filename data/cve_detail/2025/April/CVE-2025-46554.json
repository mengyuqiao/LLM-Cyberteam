{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46554", "Description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 1.8.1 to before 14.10.22, from 15.0-rc-1 to before 15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.7.0, anyone can access the metadata of any attachment in the wiki using the wiki attachment REST endpoint. There is no filtering for the results depending on current user rights, meaning an unauthenticated user could exploit this even in a private wiki. This issue has been patched in versions 14.10.22, 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.7.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46554", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-01  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-06  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22424", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-22424] Anyone can access wiki attachments list and metadata via REST API - XWiki.org JIRA", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/a43e933ddeda17dad1772396e1757998260e9342", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/37ecea84fdd053c33733c2ae9a0778bf98eae608", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/c02ce7843a39851865b9d7b6132e32fdd21e3856", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-r5cr-xm48-97xp", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
