{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27507", "Description": "The open-source identity infrastructure software Zitadel allows administrators to disable the user self-registration. ZITADEL's Admin API contains Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities that allow authenticated users, without specific IAM roles, to modify sensitive settings. While several endpoints are affected, the most critical vulnerability lies in the ability to manipulate LDAP configurations. Customers who do not utilize LDAP for authentication are not at risk from the most severe aspects of this vulnerability. However, upgrading to the patched version to address all identified issues is strongly recommended. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.71.0, 2.70.1, ,2.69.4, 2.68.4, 2.67.8, 2.66.11, 2.65.6, 2.64.5, and 2.63.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27507", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-11  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-15  0.11%  0.19%  +0.09 \n 3  2025-04-05  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 6  2025-03-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 7  2025-03-27  0.07%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 8  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-f3gh-529w-v32x", "ref_desc": "IDOR Vulnerabilities in ZITADEL's Admin API that Primarily Impact LDAP Configurations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/d9d8339813f1c43d3eb7d8d80f11fdabb2fd2ee4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
