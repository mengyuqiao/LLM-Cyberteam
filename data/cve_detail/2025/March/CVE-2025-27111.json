{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27111", "Description": "Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. The Rack::Sendfile middleware logs unsanitised header values from the X-Sendfile-Type header. An attacker can exploit this by injecting escape sequences (such as newline characters) into the header, resulting in log injection.
