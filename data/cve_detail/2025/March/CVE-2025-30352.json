{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30352", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30352", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-02  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-27  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-04-01  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.02%  0.02%  0.00 \n 6  2025-03-28  0.03%  0.02%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/ac5a9964d9926f20dc063a74cb417dc7bbad676d", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-7wq3-jr35-275c", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
