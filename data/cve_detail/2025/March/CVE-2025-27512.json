{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27512", "Description": "Zincati is an auto-update agent for Fedora CoreOS hosts. Zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the actions `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy` to deploy updates to the system and `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment` to reboot the system into the deployed update. Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket. The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. A workaround is to manually add a following polkit rule, instructions for which are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27512", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-18  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-23  0.02%  0.02%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-783 Operator Precedence Logic Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/783/Operator-Precedence-Logic-Error.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.30", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coreos/zincati/security/advisories/GHSA-w6fv-6gcc-x825", "ref_desc": "Unprivileged access to rpm-ostree D-Bus `Deploy()` and `FinalizeDeployment()` methods \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 coreos/zincati \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.24", "ref_desc": "Release zincati 0.0.24 \u00b7 coreos/zincati \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/28a43aa2c1edda091ba659677d73c13e6e3ea99d", "ref_desc": "update_agent: skip branch check when deploying \u00b7 coreos/zincati@28a43aa \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/01d8e89f799e6ba21bdf7dc668abce23bd0d8f78", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 coreos/zincati@01d8e89 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
