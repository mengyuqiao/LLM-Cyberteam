{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30140", "Description": "An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. A Public Domain name is Used for the Internal Domain Name. It uses an unregistered public domain name as an internal domain, creating a security risk. This domain was not owned by GNET originally, allowing an attacker to register it and potentially intercept sensitive device traffic (it has since been registered by the vulnerability discoverer). If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve this domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration or man-in-the-middle attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30140", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-25  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-19  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-26  0.02%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-24  0.02%  0.02%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/geo-chen/GNET", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-97FqjNeZ3CEVunqZIjxUCGGp18.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gnetsystem.com/eng/product/list?viewMode=view&idx=246&ca_id=0201", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VYs5kn4CoZKeWX2MKoVeDptPgBw.html"}]}
