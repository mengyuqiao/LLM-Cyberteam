{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27793", "Description": "Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 5.32.0, corresponding to vega-functions prior to version 5.17.0, users running Vega/Vega-lite JSON definitions could run unexpected JavaScript code when drawing graphs, unless the library was used with the `vega-interpreter`. Vega version 5.32.0 and vega-functions version 5.17.0 fix the issue. As a workaround, use `vega` with expression interpreter.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27793", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-03  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-04-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-87 Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/87/Improper-Neutralization-of-Alternate-XSS-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega/commit/694560c0aa576df8b6c5f0f7d202ac82233e6966", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://vega.github.io/vega/usage/interpreter", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega/releases/tag/v5.32.0", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-963h-3v39-3pqf", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
