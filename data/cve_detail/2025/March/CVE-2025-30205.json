{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30205", "Description": "kanidim-provision is a helper utility that uses kanidm's API to provision users, groups and oauth2 systems. Prior to version 1.2.0, a faulty function intrumentation in the (optional) kanidm patches provided by kandim-provision will cause the provisioned admin credentials to be leaked to the system log. This only impacts users which both use the provided patches and provision their `admin` or `idm_admin` account credentials this way. No other credentials are affected. Users should recompile kanidm with the newest patchset from tag `v1.2.0` or higher. As a workaround, the user can set the log level `KANIDM_LOG_LEVEL` to any level higher than `info`, for example `warn`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30205", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-31  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-25  0.03%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.02%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision/commit/a102b52e4a79be4263068577ba837f16c3e487a2", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision/security/advisories/GHSA-57fc-pcqm-53rp", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
