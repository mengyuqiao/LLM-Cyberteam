{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27822", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Masquerade module before 1.x-1.0.1 for Backdrop CMS. It allows people to temporarily switch to another user account. The module provides a \"Masquerade as admin\" permission to restrict people (who can masquerade) from switching to an account with administrative privileges. This permission is not always honored and may allow non-administrative users to masquerade as an administrator. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the \"Masquerade as user\" permission.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27822", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-contrib-2025-006", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
