{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29788", "Description": "The Syliud PayPal Plugin is the Sylius Core Team\u2019s plugin for the PayPal Commerce Platform. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.6.1, 1.7.1, and 2.0.1 allows users to manipulate the final payment amount processed by PayPal. If a user modifies the item quantity in their shopping cart after initiating the PayPal Express Checkout process, PayPal will not receive the updated total amount. As a result, PayPal captures only the initially transmitted amount, while Sylius incorrectly considers the order fully paid based on the modified total. This flaw can be exploited both accidentally and intentionally, potentially enabling fraud by allowing customers to pay less than the actual order value. Attackers can intentionally pay less than the actual total order amount, business owners may suffer financial losses due to underpaid orders, and integrity of payment processing is compromised. The issue is fixed in versions 1.6.1, 1.7.1, 2.0.1, and above. To resolve the problem in the end application without updating to the newest patches, there is a need to overwrite `ProcessPayPalOrderAction`, `CompletePayPalOrderFromPaymentPageAction`, and `CaptureAction` with modified logic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29788", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-24  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-18  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-23  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-22  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 7  2025-03-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 8  2025-03-20  0.03%  0.05%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-472 External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/472/External-Control-of-Assumed-Immutable-Web-Parameter.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/commit/8a81258f965b7860d4bccb52942e4c5b53e6774d", "ref_desc": "Fix amount change on checkout \u00b7 Sylius/PayPalPlugin@8a81258 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/security/advisories/GHSA-pqq3-q84h-pj6x", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/releases/tag/v2.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.0.1 \u00b7 Sylius/PayPalPlugin \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/releases/tag/v1.7.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.7.1 \u00b7 Sylius/PayPalPlugin \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/commit/31e71b0457e5d887a6c19f8cfabb8b16125ec406", "ref_desc": "[Bug] Fix amount change on checkout (#346) \u00b7 Sylius/PayPalPlugin@31e71b0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/releases/tag/v1.6.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.6.1 \u00b7 Sylius/PayPalPlugin \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
