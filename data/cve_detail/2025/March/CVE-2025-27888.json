{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27888", "Description": "Severity: medium (5.8) / important\n\nServer-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),\u00a0URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability in Apache Druid.\n\nThis issue affects all previous Druid versions.\n\n\nWhen using the Druid management proxy, a request that has a specially crafted URL could be used to redirect the request to an arbitrary server instead. This has the potential for XSS or XSRF. The user is required to be authenticated for this exploit. The management proxy is enabled in Druid's out-of-box configuration. It may be disabled to mitigate this vulnerability. If the management proxy is disabled, some web console features will not work properly, but core functionality is unaffected.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to Druid 31.0.2 or Druid 32.0.1, which fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27888", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Open redirect", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-21  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-28  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-27  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 7  2025-03-26  0.03%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 8  2025-03-23  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 9  2025-03-22  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 10  2025-03-21  0.04%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/c0qo989pwtrqkjv6xfr0c30dnjq8vf39", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/19/7", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
