{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30345", "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. When creating new chats via the chat_group.create action, the user is able to specify the name of the chat. Some HTML elements such as SCRIPT are filtered, whereas others are not. In most cases, HTML entities are encoded properly, but not when deleting chats or deleting messages in these chats. This potentially allows attackers to interfere with the layout of the rendered website, but it is unlikely that victims would click on deleted chats or deleted messages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30345", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenslides\u00bbOpenslidesVersions  before (<) 4.2.5cpe:2.3:a:openslides:openslides:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-28  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-22  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.02%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-28  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.03%  0.03%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2025-001-OpenSlides", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/A_EVbXeAyjKdxmKdd9pVWms3PwU.html"}]}
