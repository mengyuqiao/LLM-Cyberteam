{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27823", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Mail Disguise module before 1.x-1.0.5 for Backdrop CMS. It enables a website to obfuscate email addresses, and should prevent spambots from collecting them. The module doesn't sufficiently validate the data attribute value on links, potentially leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This is mitigated by the fact an attacker must be able to insert link (<a>) HTML elements containing data attributes into the page.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27823", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-08  0.03%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.02%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-contrib-2025-007", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
