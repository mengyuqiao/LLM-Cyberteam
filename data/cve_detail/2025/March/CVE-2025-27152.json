{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27152", "Description": "axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. The issue occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios. Even if \u2060baseURL is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios. This issue is fixed in 1.8.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27152", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-06-01  0.02%  0.02%  0.00 \n 3  2025-05-15  0.07%  0.02%  -0.05 \n 4  2025-05-14  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2025-05-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2025-04-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2025-03-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 8  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 9  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/axios/axios/security/advisories/GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6", "ref_desc": "Possible SSRF and Credential Leakage via Absolute URL in axios Requests \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 axios/axios \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6463", "ref_desc": "Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability (CVE-2024-39338) \u00b7 Issue #6463 \u00b7 axios/axios \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
