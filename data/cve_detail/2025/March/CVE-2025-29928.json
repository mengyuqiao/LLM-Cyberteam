{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29928", "Description": "authentik is an open-source identity provider. Prior to versions 2024.12.4 and 2025.2.3, when authentik was configured to use the database for session storage (which is a non-default setting), deleting sessions via the Web Interface or the API would not revoke the session and the session holder would continue to have access to authentik. authentik 2025.2.3 and 2024.12.4 fix this issue. Switching to the cache-based session storage until the authentik instance can be upgraded is recommended. This will however also delete all existing sessions and users will have to re-authenticate.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29928", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-29  0.03%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-04-03  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.03%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-p6p8-f853-9g2p", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/71294b7deb6eb5726a782de83b957eaf25fc4cf6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
