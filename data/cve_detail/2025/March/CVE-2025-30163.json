{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30163", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Node based network policies (`fromNodes` and `toNodes`) will incorrectly permit traffic to/from non-node endpoints that share the labels specified in `fromNodes` and `toNodes` sections of network policies. Node based network policy is disabled by default in Cilium. This issue affects: Cilium v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.7 inclusive and v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.1 inclusive. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.16.8 and v1.17.2. Users can work around this issue by ensuring that the labels used in `fromNodes` and `toNodes` fields are used exclusively by nodes and not by other endpoints.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30163", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-25  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-14  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#node-based", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-c6pf-2v8j-96mc", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/36657", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
