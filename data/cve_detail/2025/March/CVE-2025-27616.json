{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27616", "Description": "Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. Prior to versions 0.25.3 and 0.26.3, by spoofing a webhook payload with a specific set of headers and body data, an attacker could transfer ownership of a repository and its repo level secrets to a separate repository. These secrets could be exfiltrated by follow up builds to the repository. Users with an enabled repository with access to repo level CI secrets in Vela are vulnerable to the exploit, and any user with access to the CI instance and the linked source control manager can perform the exploit. Versions 0.25.3 and 0.26.3 fix the issue. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27616", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-17  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-11  0.03%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.02%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/server/releases/tag/v0.26.3", "ref_desc": "Release v0.26.3 \u00b7 go-vela/server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/server/releases/tag/v0.25.3", "ref_desc": "Release v0.25.3 \u00b7 go-vela/server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/server/security/advisories/GHSA-9m63-33q3-xq5x", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/67c1892e2464dc54b8d2588815dfb7819222500b", "ref_desc": "fix(patch): add v26.3 fixes to v25.3 patch branch (#1266) \u00b7 go-vela/server@67c1892 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/257886e5a3eea518548387885894e239668584f5", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
