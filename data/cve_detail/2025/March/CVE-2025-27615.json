{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27615", "Description": "umatiGateway is software for connecting OPC Unified Architecture servers with an MQTT broker utilizing JSON messages. The user interface may possibly be publicly accessible with umatiGateway's provided docker-compose file. With this access, the configuration can be viewed and altered. Commit 5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16 uses `127.0.0.1:8080:8080` to limit access to the local network. For those who are unable to use this proposed patch, a firewall on Port 8080 may block remote access, but the workaround may not be perfect because Docker may also bypass a firewall by its iptable based rules for port forwarding.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27615", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/commit/5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16", "ref_desc": "fix(docs): Publish UI only on localhost. \u00b7 umati/umatiGateway@5d81a34 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/pull/101", "ref_desc": "fix(docs): Publish UI only on localhost. by ccvca \u00b7 Pull Request #101 \u00b7 umati/umatiGateway \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/security/advisories/GHSA-qf9w-x9qx-2mq7", "ref_desc": "UI public accessable in provided docker-compose file \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 umati/umatiGateway \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/blob/abe73096a17307327f0d6dc0ed4db1fb93464521/README.md?plain=1#L34-L35", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
