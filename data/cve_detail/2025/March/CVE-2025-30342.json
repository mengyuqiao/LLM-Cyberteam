{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30342", "Description": "An XSS issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. When submitting descriptions such as Moderator Notes or Agenda Topics, an editor is shown that allows one to format the submitted text. This allows insertion of various HTML elements. When trying to insert a SCRIPT element, it is properly encoded when reflected; however, adding attributes to links is possible, which allows the injection of JavaScript via the onmouseover attribute and others. When a user moves the mouse over such a prepared link, JavaScript is executed in that user's session.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30342", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOpenslides\u00bbOpenslidesVersions  before (<) 4.2.5cpe:2.3:a:openslides:openslides:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-28  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-22  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.02%  0.00 \n 5  2025-03-23  0.03%  0.03%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2025-001-OpenSlides", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/A_EVbXeAyjKdxmKdd9pVWms3PwU.html"}]}
