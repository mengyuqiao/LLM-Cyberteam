{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29913", "Description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted telecommand (TC) frame that causes an unsigned integer underflow. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD`, specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest` buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation, the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location, leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability is still present in the repository as of commit `d3cc420ace96d02a5b7e83d88cbd2e48010d5723`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29913", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.3cpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibVersions  before (<) 1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-24  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-08  0.08%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 3  2025-04-18  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 7  2025-03-20  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-q4v2-fvrv-qrf6", "ref_desc": "Buffer Overflow Due to Integer Underflow in Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD of CryptoLib \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nasa/CryptoLib \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
