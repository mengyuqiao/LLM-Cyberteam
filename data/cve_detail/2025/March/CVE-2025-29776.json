{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29776", "Description": "Azle is a WebAssembly runtime for TypeScript and JavaScript on ICP. Calling `setTimer` in Azle versions `0.27.0`, `0.28.0`, and `0.29.0` causes an immediate infinite loop of timers to be executed on the canister, each timer attempting to clean up the global state of the previous timer. The infinite loop will occur with any valid invocation of `setTimer`. The problem has been fixed as of Azle version `0.30.0`. As a workaround, if a canister is caught in this infinite loop after calling `setTimer`, the canister can be upgraded and the timers will all be cleared, thus ending the loop.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29776", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/releases/tag/0.30.0", "ref_desc": "Release 0.30.0 \u00b7 demergent-labs/azle \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/security/advisories/GHSA-xc76-5pf9-mx8m", "ref_desc": "Calling `setTimer` causes infinite loop of timers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 demergent-labs/azle \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
