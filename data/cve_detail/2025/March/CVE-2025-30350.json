{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30350", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The `@directus/storage-driver-s3` package starting in version 9.22.0 and prior to version 12.0.1, corresponding to Directus starting in version 9.22.0 and prior to 11.5.0, is vulnerable to asset unavailability after a burst of HEAD requests. Some tools use Directus to sync content and assets, and some of those tools use the HEAD method to check the existence of files. When making many HEAD requests at once, at some point, all assets are eventually served as 403. This causes denial of assets for all policies of Directus, including Admin and Public. Version 12.0.1 of the `@directus/storage-driver-s3` package, corresponding to version 11.5.0 of Directus, fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30350", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-02  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-27  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-04-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-rv78-qqrq-73m5", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
