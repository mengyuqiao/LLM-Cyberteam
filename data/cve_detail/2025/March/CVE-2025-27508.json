{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27508", "Description": "Emissary is a P2P based data-driven workflow engine. The ChecksumCalculator class within allows for hashing and checksum generation, but it includes or defaults to algorithms that are no longer recommended for secure cryptographic use cases (e.g., SHA-1, CRC32, and SSDEEP). These algorithms, while possibly valid for certain non-security-critical tasks, can expose users to security risks if used in scenarios where strong cryptographic guarantees are required. This issue is fixed in 8.24.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27508", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.02%  0.02%  0.00 \n 3  2025-03-28  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-27  0.02%  0.02%  0.00 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/commit/da3a81a8977577597ff2a944820a5ae4e9762368", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/security/advisories/GHSA-hw43-fcmm-3m5g", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
