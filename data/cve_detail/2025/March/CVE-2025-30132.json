{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30132", "Description": "An issue was discovered on IROAD Dashcam V devices. It uses an unregistered public domain name as an internal domain, creating a security risk. During analysis, it was found that this domain was not owned by IROAD, allowing an attacker to register it and potentially intercept sensitive device traffic. If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve this domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration or man-in-the-middle attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30132", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-25  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-19  0.03%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-24  0.03%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-22  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/geo-chen/IROAD-V", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/F0EnRWslfQXjUQaExULKBjiOzSc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/geo-chen/IROAD?tab=readme-ov-file#finding-6-public-domain-used-for-internal-domain-name", "ref_desc": "GitHub - geo-chen/IROADCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XBwchPkj1H_kXago8mchIIMzbR0.html"}]}
