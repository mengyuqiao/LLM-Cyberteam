{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27102", "Description": "Agate is central authentication server software for OBiBa epidemiology applications. Prior to version 3.3.0, when registering for an Agate account, arbitrary HTML code can be injected into a user's first and last name. This HTML is then rendered in the email sent to administrative users. The Agate service account sends this email and appears trustworthy, making this a significant risk for phishing attacks. Administrative users are impacted, as they can be targeted by unauthenticated users. Version 3.3.0 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27102", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-24  0.20%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-28  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-04-18  0.14%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 4  2025-04-11  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 5  2025-03-30  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 6  2025-03-29  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 7  2025-03-23  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 8  2025-03-20  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/obiba/agate/releases/tag/3.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release 3.3.0 \u00b7 obiba/agate \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/obiba/agate/security/advisories/GHSA-v3wj-7vj5-xj5v", "ref_desc": "HTML injection in user signup - Administrator phishing risk \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 obiba/agate \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
