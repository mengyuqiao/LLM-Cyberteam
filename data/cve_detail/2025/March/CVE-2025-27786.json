{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27786", "Description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to arbitrary file removal in core.py. `output_tts_path` in tts.py takes arbitrary user input and passes it to `run_tts_script` function in core.py, which checks if the path in `output_tts_path` exists, and if yes, removes that path, which leads to arbitrary file removal. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27786", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-25  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2025-03-22  0.06%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 8  2025-03-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-341_GHSL-2024-353_Applio/", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6rp-Q3Ddo93y09pp9RUjT2trkmM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/tts/tts.py#L133", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/core.py#L329", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
