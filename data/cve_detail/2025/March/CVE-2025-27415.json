{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27415", "Description": "Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Prior to 3.16.0, by sending a crafted HTTP request to a server behind an CDN, it is possible in some circumstances to poison the CDN cache and highly impacts the availability of a site. It is possible to craft a request, such as https://mysite.com/?/_payload.json which will be rendered as JSON. If the CDN in front of a Nuxt site ignores the query string when determining whether to cache a route, then this JSON response could be served to future visitors to the site. An attacker can perform this attack to a vulnerable site in order to make a site unavailable indefinitely. It is also possible in the case where the cache will be reset to make a small script to send a request each X seconds (=caching duration) so that the cache is permanently poisoned making the site completely unavailable. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.16.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27415", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.31%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-13  0.40%  0.31%  -0.09 \n 3  2025-04-20  0.34%  0.40%  +0.05 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.29%  0.34%  +0.06 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.34%  0.29%  -0.06 \n 6  2025-03-28  0.23%  0.34%  +0.11 \n 7  2025-03-27  0.28%  0.23%  -0.05 \n 8  2025-03-25  0.21%  0.28%  +0.07 \n 9  2025-03-23  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 10  2025-03-22  0.20%  0.19%  -0.01 \n 11  2025-03-21  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-349 Acceptance of Extraneous Untrusted Data With Trusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/349/Acceptance-of-Extraneous-Untrusted-Data-With-Trusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/security/advisories/GHSA-jvhm-gjrh-3h93", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
