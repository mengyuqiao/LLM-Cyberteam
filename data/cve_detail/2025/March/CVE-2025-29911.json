{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29911", "Description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted AOS frame with an insufficient length. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity`, specifically during the processing of the Frame Error Control Field (FECF). The affected code attempts to read from the `p_ingest` buffer at indices `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 2` and `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 1` without verifying if `len_ingest` is sufficiently large. This leads to a heap buffer overflow when `len_ingest` is smaller than `max_frame_size`. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29911", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibcpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.3cpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-24  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-01  0.08%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 3  2025-04-18  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 7  2025-03-20  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-7g6g-9gj4-8c68", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
