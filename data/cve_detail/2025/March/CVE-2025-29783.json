{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29783", "Description": "vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. When vLLM is configured to use Mooncake, unsafe deserialization exposed directly over ZMQ/TCP on all network interfaces will allow attackers to execute remote code on distributed hosts. This is a remote code execution vulnerability impacting any deployments using Mooncake to distribute KV across distributed hosts. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29783", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  1.21%  1.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-20  0.67%  1.21%  +0.54 \n 3  2025-04-09  0.58%  0.67%  +0.09 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.40%  0.58%  +0.18 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.58%  0.40%  -0.18 \n 6  2025-03-28  0.40%  0.58%  +0.18 \n 7  2025-03-27  0.58%  0.40%  -0.18 \n 8  2025-03-26  0.54%  0.58%  +0.04 \n 9  2025-03-25  0.34%  0.54%  +0.20 \n 10  2025-03-23  0.53%  0.34%  -0.19 \n 11  2025-03-22  0.24%  0.53%  +0.28 \n 12  2025-03-21  0.33%  0.24%  -0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-x3m8-f7g5-qhm7", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0QAlHXMmsZaZ7ihGhSMpUhmM_Zs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/288ca110f68d23909728627d3100e5a8db820aa2", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/14228", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
