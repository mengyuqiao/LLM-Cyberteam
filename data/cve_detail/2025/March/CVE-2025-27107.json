{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27107", "Description": "Integrated Scripting is a tool for creating scripts for handling complex operations in Integrated Dynamics. Minecraft users who use Integrated Scripting prior to versions 1.21.1-1.0.17, 1.21.4-1.0.9-254, 1.20.1-1.0.13, and 1.19.2-1.0.10 may be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. By using Java reflection on a thrown exception object it's possible to escape the JavaScript sandbox for IntegratedScripting's Variable Cards, and leverage that to construct arbitrary Java classes and invoke arbitrary Java methods.\nThis vulnerability allows for execution of arbitrary Java methods, and by extension arbitrary native code e.g. from `java.lang.Runtime.exec`, on the Minecraft server by any player with the ability to create and use an IntegratedScripting Variable Card. Versions 1.21.1-1.0.17, 1.21.4-1.0.9-254, 1.20.1-1.0.13, and 1.19.2-1.0.10 fix the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27107", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-20  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-14  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 5  2025-03-23  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CyclopsMC/IntegratedScripting/blob/29051aace619604fb5dd60624b72dba428fea2f2/src/main/java/org/cyclops/integratedscripting/evaluate/translation/ValueTranslators.java", "ref_desc": "IntegratedScripting/src/main/java/org/cyclops/integratedscripting/evaluate/translation/ValueTranslators.java at 29051aace619604fb5dd60624b72dba428fea2f2 \u00b7 CyclopsMC/IntegratedScripting \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CyclopsMC/IntegratedScripting/blob/29051aace619604fb5dd60624b72dba428fea2f2/src/main/java/org/cyclops/integratedscripting/evaluate/ScriptHelpers.java#L46", "ref_desc": "IntegratedScripting/src/main/java/org/cyclops/integratedscripting/evaluate/ScriptHelpers.java at 29051aace619604fb5dd60624b72dba428fea2f2 \u00b7 CyclopsMC/IntegratedScripting \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CyclopsMC/IntegratedScripting/security/advisories/GHSA-2v5x-4823-hq77", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary code execution via Java reflection in IntegratedScripting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CyclopsMC/IntegratedScripting \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
