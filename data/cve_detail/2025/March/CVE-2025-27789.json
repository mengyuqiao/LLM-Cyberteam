{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27789", "Description": "Babel is a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. When using versions of Babel prior to 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17 to compile regular expression named capturing groups, Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`). Generated code is vulnerable if all the following conditions are true: Using Babel to compile regular expression named capturing groups, using the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups, and the code using untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`. This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17. It's likely that individual users do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees use of a new enough `@babel/helpers` version. Note that just updating Babel dependencies is not enough; one will also need to re-compile the code. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27789", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
