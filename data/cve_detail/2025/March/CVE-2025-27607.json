{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27607", "Description": "Python JSON Logger is a JSON Formatter for Python Logging. Between 30 December 2024 and 4 March 2025 Python JSON Logger was vulnerable to RCE through a missing dependency. This occurred because msgspec-python313-pre was deleted by the owner leaving the name open to being claimed by a third party. If the package was claimed, it would allow them RCE on any Python JSON Logger user who installed the development dependencies on Python 3.13 (e.g. pip install python-json-logger[dev]). This issue has been resolved with 3.3.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27607", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.75% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  1.52%  1.75%  +0.23 \n 2  2025-04-27  1.19%  1.52%  +0.33 \n 3  2025-04-15  0.90%  1.19%  +0.30 \n 4  2025-04-08  0.61%  0.90%  +0.29 \n 5  2025-03-30  1.86%  0.61%  -1.25 \n 6  2025-03-29  0.61%  1.86%  +1.25 \n 7  2025-03-28  4.12%  0.61%  -3.51 \n 8  2025-03-27  1.86%  4.12%  +2.26 \n 9  2025-03-25  1.02%  1.86%  +0.84 \n 10  2025-03-23  0.45%  1.02%  +0.57 \n 11  2025-03-20  1.02%  0.45%  -0.57 \n 12  2025-03-17  0.05%  1.02%  +0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/commit/e7761e56edb980cfab0165e32469d5fd017a5d72", "ref_desc": "Fix import pthonjsonlogger.jsonlogger (#33) \u00b7 nhairs/python-json-logger@e7761e5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/commit/2548e3a2e3cedf6bef3ee7c60c55b7c02d1af11a", "ref_desc": "[pyproject] Support Python 3.13 (#23) \u00b7 nhairs/python-json-logger@2548e3a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/security/advisories/GHSA-wmxh-pxcx-9w24", "ref_desc": "Potential RCE via missing `msgspec-python313-pre` dependency \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nhairs/python-json-logger \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
