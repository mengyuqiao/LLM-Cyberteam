{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27501", "Description": "OpenZiti is a free and open source project focused on bringing zero trust to any application. An endpoint on the admin panel can be accessed without any form of authentication. This endpoint accepts a user-supplied URL parameter to connect to an OpenZiti Controller and performs a server-side request, resulting in a potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The fixed version has moved the request to the external controller from the server side to the client side, thereby eliminating the identity of the node from being used to gain any additional permissions. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.7.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27501", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nOpenziti\u00bbOpenzitiVersions  before (<) 3.7.1cpe:2.3:a:openziti:openziti:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-04-04  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-28  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openziti/ziti-console/security/advisories/GHSA-fqxh-vfv5-8qjp", "ref_desc": "Server Side Request Forgery in Ziti Console \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openziti/ziti-console \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
