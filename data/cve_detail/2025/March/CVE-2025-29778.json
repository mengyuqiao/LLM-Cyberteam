{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29778", "Description": "Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Prior to version 1.14.0-alpha.1, Kyverno ignores subjectRegExp and IssuerRegExp while verifying artifact's sign with keyless mode. It allows the attacker to deploy kubernetes resources with the artifacts that were signed by unexpected certificate. Deploying these unauthorized kubernetes resources can lead to full compromise of kubernetes cluster. Version 1.14.0-alpha.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29778", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-25  0.02%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.02%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.02%  0.02%  0.00 \n 4  2025-03-27  0.01%  0.02%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/commit/8777672fb17bdf252bd2e7d8de3441e240404a60", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Mohdcode/kyverno/blob/373f942ea9fa8b63140d0eb0e101b9a5f71033f3/pkg/cosign/cosign.go#L537", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/policies/issues/1246", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-46mp-8w32-6g94", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/pull/12237", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
