{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27636", "Description": "Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel components under particular conditions.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through <= 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through <= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through <= 3.22.3.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.\n\n\n\nThis vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific\n\nheaders that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, to call another method\n\non the bean, than was coded in the application. In the camel-jms component, then a malicious header can be used to send\n\nthe message to another queue (on the same broker) than was coded in the application. This could also be seen by using the camel-exec component\n\n\n\n\nThe attacker would need to inject custom headers, such as HTTP protocols. So if you have Camel applications that are\n\ndirectly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include malicious HTTP headers in the HTTP requests\n\nthat are send to the Camel application.\n\n\n\n\nAll the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.\n\nIn these conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the same bean.\n\nIn terms of usage of the default header filter strategy the list of components using that is: \n\n\n  *  camel-activemq\n  *  camel-activemq6\n  *  camel-amqp\n  *  camel-aws2-sqs\n  *  camel-azure-servicebus\n  *  camel-cxf-rest\n  *  camel-cxf-soap\n  *  camel-http\n  *  camel-jetty\n  *  camel-jms\n  *  camel-kafka\n  *  camel-knative\n  *  camel-mail\n  *  camel-nats\n  *  camel-netty-http\n  *  camel-platform-http\n  *  camel-rest\n  *  camel-sjms\n  *  camel-spring-rabbitmq\n  *  camel-stomp\n  *  camel-tahu\n  *  camel-undertow\n  *  camel-xmpp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with \"Camel\", \"camel\", or \"org.apache.camel.\".\u00a0\n\n\nMitigation:\u00a0You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the\u00a0headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also\u00a0globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like \"cAmel, cAMEL\" etc, or in general everything not starting with \"Camel\", \"camel\" or \"org.apache.camel.\".", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27636", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "42.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-16  41.15%  42.09%  +0.94 \n 2  2025-04-29  36.26%  41.15%  +4.89 \n 3  2025-04-24  38.79%  36.26%  -2.53 \n 4  2025-04-22  41.10%  38.79%  -2.31 \n 5  2025-04-21  39.97%  41.10%  +1.12 \n 6  2025-04-16  40.02%  39.97%  -0.04 \n 7  2025-04-15  21.80%  40.02%  +18.22 \n 8  2025-04-10  20.46%  21.80%  +1.35 \n 9  2025-04-03  16.44%  20.46%  +4.01 \n 10  2025-03-30  10.35%  16.44%  +6.10 \n 11  2025-03-29  16.44%  10.35%  -6.10 \n 12  2025-03-27  11.06%  16.44%  +5.39 \n 13  2025-03-26  8.72%  11.06%  +2.34 \n 14  2025-03-23  4.08%  8.72%  +4.65 \n 15  2025-03-20  2.53%  4.08%  +1.54 \n 16  2025-03-17  0.05%  2.53%  +2.49 \n 17  2025-03-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-178 Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/178/Improper-Handling-of-Case-Sensitivity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://camel.apache.org/security/CVE-2025-27636.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Camel Security Advisory - CVE-2025-27636 - Apache CamelCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JoyEjQK7DPv9LKSqB0nxdmSbyLI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://camel.apache.org/security/CVE-2025-27636.txt.asc", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/akamai/CVE-2025-27636-Apache-Camel-PoC/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/camel/VulnerableCamel.java", "ref_desc": "CVE-2025-27636-Apache-Camel-PoC/src/main/java/com/example/camel/VulnerableCamel.java at main \u00b7 akamai/CVE-2025-27636-Apache-Camel-PoC \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/09/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2025-27636: Apache Camel: Camel Message Header Injection via Improper Filtering", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-21828", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/l3zcg3vts88bmc7w8172wkgw610y693z", "ref_desc": "CVE-2025-27636: Apache Camel: Camel Message Header Injection via Improper Filtering-Apache Mail Archives", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
