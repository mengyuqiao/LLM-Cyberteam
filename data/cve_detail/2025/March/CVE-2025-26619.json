{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-26619", "Description": "Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In `vega` 5.30.0 and lower and in `vega-functions` 5.15.0 and lower , it was possible to call JavaScript functions from the Vega expression language that were not meant to be supported. The issue is patched in `vega` `5.31.0`  and `vega-functions` `5.16.0`. Some workarounds are available. Run `vega` without `vega.expressionInterpreter`. This mode is not the default as it is slower. Alternatively, using the interpreter described in CSP safe mode (Content Security Policy) prevents arbitrary Javascript from running, so users of this mode are not affected by this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26619", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVega Project\u00bbVegaVersions  before (<) 5.31.0cpe:2.3:a:vega_project:vega:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVega Project\u00bbVega\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.31.0cpe:2.3:a:vega_project:vega:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nVega-functions Project\u00bbVega-functions\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.16.0cpe:2.3:a:vega-functions_project:vega-functions:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nVega-functions Project\u00bbVega-functionsVersions  before (<) 5.16.0cpe:2.3:a:vega-functions_project:vega-functions:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-08  0.03%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-04-28  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-04-12  0.06%  0.03%  -0.03 \n 5  2025-04-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 6  2025-03-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 7  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/issues/9469", "ref_desc": "Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/3984", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega/commit/8fc129a6f8a11e96449c4ac0f63de0e5bfc7254c", "ref_desc": "Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-rcw3-wmx7-cphr", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
