{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29930", "Description": "imFAQ is an advanced questions and answers management system for ImpressCMS. Prior to 1.0.1, if the $_GET['seoOp'] parameter is manipulated to include malicious input (e.g., seoOp=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/config.php), the application could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server (Local File Inclusion, LFI). The $_GET['seoOp'] and $_GET['seoArg'] parameters are directly used without sanitization or validation. This is partly mitigated by the fact that the ImpressCMS sensitive files are stored outside the web root, in a folder with a randomized name. The issue has been resolved in imFaq 1.0.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29930", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-25  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/73/External-Control-of-File-Name-or-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ImpressModules/imfaq/security/advisories/GHSA-vrr3-54vc-vwg3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ImpressModules/imfaq/commit/63dedd30a8f196db7b340740adf667a39c26a4ac", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
