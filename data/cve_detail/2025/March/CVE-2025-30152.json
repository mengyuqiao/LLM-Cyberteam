{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30152", "Description": "The Syliud PayPal Plugin is the Sylius Core Team\u2019s plugin for the PayPal Commerce Platform. Prior to 1.6.2, 1.7.2, and 2.0.2, a discovered vulnerability allows users to modify their shopping cart after completing the PayPal Checkout process and payment authorization. If a user initiates a PayPal transaction from a product page or the cart page and then returns to the order summary page, they can still manipulate the cart contents before finalizing the order. As a result, the order amount in Sylius may be higher than the amount actually captured by PayPal, leading to a scenario where merchants deliver products or services without full payment. The issue is fixed in versions: 1.6.2, 1.7.2, 2.0.2 and above.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30152", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-20  0.03%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-25  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-472 External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/472/External-Control-of-Assumed-Immutable-Web-Parameter.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/security/advisories/GHSA-hxg4-65p5-9w37", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/commit/5613df827a6d4fc50862229295976200a68e97aa", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
