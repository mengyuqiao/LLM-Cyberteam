{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30208", "Description": "Vite, a provider of frontend development tooling, has a vulnerability in versions prior to 6.2.3, 6.1.2, 6.0.12, 5.4.15, and 4.5.10. `@fs` denies access to files outside of Vite serving allow list. Adding `?raw??` or `?import&raw??` to the URL bypasses this limitation and returns the file content if it exists. This bypass exists because trailing separators such as `?` are removed in several places, but are not accounted for in query string regexes. The contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or `server.host` config option) are affected. Versions 6.2.3, 6.1.2, 6.0.12, 5.4.15, and 4.5.10 fix the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30208", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "64.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-06  56.20%  64.01%  +7.81 \n 2  2025-06-04  56.34%  56.20%  -0.14 \n 3  2025-05-31  53.41%  56.34%  +2.94 \n 4  2025-05-28  55.63%  53.41%  -2.23 \n 5  2025-05-22  57.01%  55.63%  -1.38 \n 6  2025-05-21  60.86%  57.01%  -3.86 \n 7  2025-05-20  67.24%  60.86%  -6.37 \n 8  2025-05-17  69.46%  67.24%  -2.22 \n 9  2025-05-15  67.24%  69.46%  +2.22 \n 10  2025-05-14  63.19%  67.24%  +4.04 \n 11  2025-04-25  59.42%  63.19%  +3.78 \n 12  2025-04-24  53.26%  59.42%  +6.16 \n 13  2025-04-18  47.28%  53.26%  +5.97 \n 14  2025-04-15  44.97%  47.28%  +2.32 \n 15  2025-04-11  40.27%  44.97%  +4.69 \n 16  2025-04-04  38.00%  40.27%  +2.28 \n 17  2025-03-30  40.13%  38.00%  -2.13 \n 18  2025-03-29  32.78%  40.13%  +7.35 \n 19  2025-03-28  6.62%  32.78%  +26.16 \n 20  2025-03-27  0.06%  6.62%  +6.56 \n 21  2025-03-26  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/92ca12dc79118bf66f2b32ff81ed09e0d0bd07ca", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/80381c38d6f068b12e6e928cd3c616bd1d64803c", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/315695e9d97cc6cfa7e6d9e0229fb50cdae3d9f4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-x574-m823-4x7w", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/807d7f06d33ab49c48a2a3501da3eea1906c0d41", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/f234b5744d8b74c95535a7b82cc88ed2144263c1", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
