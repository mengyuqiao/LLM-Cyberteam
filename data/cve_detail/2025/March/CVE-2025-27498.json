{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27498", "Description": "aes-gcm is a pure Rust implementation of the AES-GCM. In decrypt_in_place_detached, the decrypted ciphertext (which is the correct ciphertext) is exposed even if the tag is incorrect. This is because in decrypt_inplace in asconcore.rs, tag verification causes an error to be returned with the plaintext contents still in buffer. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27498", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~  % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.01%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/security/advisories/GHSA-r38m-44fw-h886", "ref_desc": "AEADs/ascon-aead: Plaintext exposed in decrypt_in_place_detached even on tag verification failure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RustCrypto/AEADs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/commit/d1d749ba57e38e65b0e037cd744d0b17f7254037", "ref_desc": "ascon-aead: zeroize buffer during decryption on failed tag check (#661) \u00b7 RustCrypto/AEADs@d1d749b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
