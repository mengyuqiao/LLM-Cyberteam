{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29927", "Description": "Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29927", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "93.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  93.20%  93.16%  -0.04 \n 2  2025-06-03  93.08%  93.20%  +0.12 \n 3  2025-06-01  93.16%  93.08%  -0.08 \n 4  2025-05-28  93.11%  93.16%  +0.04 \n 5  2025-05-20  91.96%  93.11%  +1.15 \n 6  2025-05-17  92.20%  91.96%  -0.23 \n 7  2025-05-15  92.65%  92.20%  -0.45 \n 8  2025-05-11  92.43%  92.65%  +0.21 \n 9  2025-05-05  92.56%  92.43%  -0.12 \n 10  2025-05-04  92.05%  92.56%  +0.50 \n 11  2025-05-01  92.56%  92.05%  -0.50 \n 12  2025-04-22  91.90%  92.56%  +0.66 \n 13  2025-04-21  91.42%  91.90%  +0.48 \n 14  2025-04-15  89.24%  91.42%  +2.18 \n 15  2025-04-09  89.10%  89.24%  +0.14 \n 16  2025-04-08  85.63%  89.10%  +3.47 \n 17  2025-04-07  84.70%  85.63%  +0.93 \n 18  2025-03-30  84.75%  84.70%  -0.05 \n 19  2025-03-29  83.13%  84.75%  +1.62 \n 20  2025-03-27  50.73%  83.13%  +32.40 \n 21  2025-03-26  49.79%  50.73%  +0.94 \n 22  2025-03-25  32.08%  49.79%  +17.71 \n 23  2025-03-24  0.16%  32.08%  +31.92 \n 24  2025-03-23  0.03%  0.16%  +0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/5fd3ae8f8542677c6294f32d18022731eab6fe48", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/52a078da3884efe6501613c7834a3d02a91676d2", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/23/3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.3.5", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v13.5.9", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/23/4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250328-0002/", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
