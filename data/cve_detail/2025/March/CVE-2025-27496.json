{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27496", "Description": "Snowflake, a platform for using artificial intelligence in the context of cloud computing, has a vulnerability in the Snowflake JDBC driver (\"Driver\") in versions 3.0.13 through 3.23.0 of the driver. When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations,  and is not logged server-side by Snowflake. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.23.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27496", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 1 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-20  0.01%  0.01%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-23  0.01%  0.01%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-22  0.01%  0.01%  0.00 \n 4  2025-03-21  0.01%  0.01%  +0.00 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.01%  -0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-q298-375f-5q63", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/commit/ef81582ce2f1dbc3c8794a696c94f4fe65fad507", "ref_desc": "SNOW-1660591 Remove sensitive encryption info when logging (#2077) \u00b7 snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc@ef81582 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
