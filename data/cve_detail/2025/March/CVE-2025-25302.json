{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25302", "Description": "Rembg is a tool to remove images background. In Rembg 2.0.57 and earlier, the CORS middleware is setup incorrectly. All origins are reflected, which allows any website to send cross site requests to the rembg server and thus query any API. Even if authentication were to be enabled, allow_credentials is set to True, which would allow any website to send authenticated cross site requests.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25302", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDanielgatis\u00bbRembgVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.57cpe:2.3:a:danielgatis:rembg:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~  % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-10  0.01%  0.01%  0.00 \n 2  2025-03-28  0.01%  0.01%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-22  0.02%  0.01%  -0.01 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-161_GHSL-2024-162_rembg/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2024-161_GHSL-2024-162: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and a weak default CORS configuration in rembg - CVE-2025-25301, CVE-2025-25302 | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MLCNin8l5LzA8u-qEr6mYbN0Fmg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/blob/d1e00734f8a996abf512a3a5c251c7a9a392c90a/rembg/commands/s_command.py#L93", "ref_desc": "rembg/rembg/commands/s_command.py at d1e00734f8a996abf512a3a5c251c7a9a392c90a \u00b7 danielgatis/rembg \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
