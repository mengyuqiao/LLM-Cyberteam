{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27017", "Description": "Apache NiFi 1.13.0 through 2.2.0 includes the username and password used to authenticate with MongoDB in the NiFi provenance events that MongoDB components generate during processing. An authorized user with read access to the provenance events of those processors may see the credentials information. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.3.0 is the recommended mitigation, which removes the credentials from provenance event records.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27017", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-19  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-538 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/538/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Externally-Accessibl.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/d4n5474jkhp82dvnht13pjtlfx7bhn5q", "ref_desc": "CVE-2025-27017: Apache NiFi: Potential Insertion of MongoDB Password in Provenance Record-Apache Mail Archives", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/11/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2025-27017: Apache NiFi: Potential Insertion of MongoDB Password in Provenance Record", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
