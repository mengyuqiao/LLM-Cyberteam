{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29773", "Description": "Froxlor is open-source server administration software. A vulnerability in versions prior to 2.2.6 allows users (such as resellers or customers) to create accounts with the same email address as an existing account. This creates potential issues with account identification and security. This vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users (e.g., reseller, customer) who can create accounts with the same email address that has already been used by another account, such as the admin. The attack vector is email-based, as the system does not prevent multiple accounts from registering the same email address, leading to possible conflicts and security issues. Version 2.2.6 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29773", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFroxlor\u00bbFroxlorVersions  before (<) 2.2.6cpe:2.3:a:froxlor:froxlor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFroxlor\u00bbFroxlor\u00bbVersion:2.2.5cpe:2.3:a:froxlor:froxlor:2.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-20  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-14  0.01%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-04-05  0.01%  0.01%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.01%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/froxlor/Froxlor/commit/a43d53d54034805e3e404702a01312fa0c40b623", "ref_desc": "force admin email addresses to be unique and not be used for customer\u2026 \u00b7 froxlor/Froxlor@a43d53d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/froxlor/Froxlor/security/advisories/GHSA-7j6w-p859-464f", "ref_desc": "Multiple Accounts Can Share the Same Email Address Leading to Potential Privilege Escalation or Account Takeover \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 froxlor/Froxlor \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mega.nz/file/h8oFHQrL#I4V02_BWee4CCx7OoBl_2Ufkd5Wc7fvs5aCatGApkoQ", "ref_desc": "Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
