{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27777", "Description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in `model_download.py` (line 195 in 3.2.7). The blind SSRF allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The blind SSRF can also be coupled with a arbitrary file read (e.g., CVE-2025-27784) to read files from hosts on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach, which would make it a full SSRF. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27777", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-20  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-25  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 7  2025-03-22  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 \n 8  2025-03-21  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/assets/flask/routes.py#L14", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_Hgek1aBzKsXqjdZk1Z3btIO2Vk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-341_GHSL-2024-353_Applio/", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6rp-Q3Ddo93y09pp9RUjT2trkmM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/download/download.py#L192-L196", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8dzcanxkHfeNh1Txwt-kmvQhed0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/rvc/lib/tools/model_download.py#L195", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
