{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27406", "Description": "Icinga Reporting is the central component for reporting related functionality in the monitoring web frontend and framework Icinga Web 2. A vulnerability present in versions 0.10.0 through 1.0.2 allows to set up a template that allows to embed arbitrary Javascript. This enables the attacker to act on behalf of the user, if the template is being previewed; and act on behalf of the headless browser, if a report using the template is printed to PDF. This issue has been resolved in version 1.0.3 of Icinga Reporting. As a workaround, review all templates and remove suspicious settings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27406", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-02  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-04-01  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 6  2025-03-28  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/security/advisories/GHSA-7qvq-54vm-r7hx", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/releases/tag/v1.0.3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
