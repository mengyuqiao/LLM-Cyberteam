{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24808", "Description": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to versions `3.3.4` on the `stable` branch and `3.4.0.beta5` on the `beta` branch, someone who is about to reach the limit of users in a group DM may send requests to add new users in parallel. The requests might all go through ignoring the limit due to a race condition. The patch in versions `3.3.4` and `3.4.0.beta5` uses the `lock` step in service to wrap part of the `add_users_to_channel` service inside a distributed lock/mutex in order to avoid the race condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24808", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-27  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-01  0.02%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.02%  0.02%  0.00 \n 5  2025-03-28  0.03%  0.02%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/a16b2f224860f6678f89f5ffa012f0ede17e4095", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-hfcx-qjw6-573r", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
