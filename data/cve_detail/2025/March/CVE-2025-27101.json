{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27101", "Description": "Opal is OBiBa\u2019s core database application for biobanks or epidemiological studies. Prior to version 5.1.1, when copying any parent directory to a folder in the /temp/ directory, all files in that parent directory are copied, including files which the user should not have access to. All users of the application are impacted, as this is exploitable by any user to reveal all files in the opal filesystem. This also means that low-privilege users such as DataShield users can retrieve the files of other users. Version 5.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27101", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-01  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-04-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 7  2025-03-22  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 8  2025-03-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 9  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/obiba/opal/commit/fca7dc9c8348064741b2e8b2c31b66660a935743", "ref_desc": "fix: do not copy or move a parent folder into one of its children #4004 \u00b7 obiba/opal@fca7dc9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/obiba/opal/security/advisories/GHSA-rxmx-gqjj-vhv8", "ref_desc": "Broken Access Control in Opal filesystem's copy functionality exposes all user dataa \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 obiba/opal \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
