{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27519", "Description": "Cognita is a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Framework for building modular, open source applications for production by TrueFoundry. A path traversal issue exists at /v1/internal/upload-to-local-directory which is enabled when the Local env variable is set to true, such as when Cognita is setup using Docker. Because the docker environment sets up the backend uvicorn server with auto reload enabled, when an attacker overwrites the /app/backend/__init__.py file, the file will automatically be reloaded and executed. This allows an attacker to get remote code execution in the context of the Docker container. This vulnerability is fixed in commit a78bd065e05a1b30a53a3386cc02e08c317d2243.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27519", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  0.46%  0.48%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-04-15  0.34%  0.46%  +0.12 \n 3  2025-04-08  0.31%  0.34%  +0.03 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.22%  0.31%  +0.09 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.31%  0.22%  -0.09 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.31%  +0.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/truefoundry/cognita/pull/393", "ref_desc": "Validate paths during local upload by chiragjn \u00b7 Pull Request #393 \u00b7 truefoundry/cognita \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-193_GHSL-2024-194_Cognita/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2024-193_GHSL-2024-194: Zero click RCE vulnerability in Cognita | GitHub Security LabCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iEvhm4B5Lye7YqwA-4_WdKtbkGQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/truefoundry/cognita/commit/a78bd065e05a1b30a53a3386cc02e08c317d2243", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
