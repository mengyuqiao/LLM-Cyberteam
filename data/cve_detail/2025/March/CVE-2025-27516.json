{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27516", "Description": "Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.6.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27516", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-12  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-03  0.03%  0.03%  0.00 \n 3  2025-05-01  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-04-29  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-04-15  0.07%  0.04%  -0.04 \n 6  2025-04-07  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 9  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1336 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1336/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-Used-in-a-Templa.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/04/msg00045.html", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-cpwx-vrp4-4pq7", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/90457bbf33b8662926ae65cdde4c4c32e756e403", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 pallets/jinja@90457bb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
