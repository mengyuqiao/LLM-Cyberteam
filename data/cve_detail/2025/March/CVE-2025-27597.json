{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27597", "Description": "Vue I18n is the internationalization plugin for Vue.js. @intlify/message-resolver and @intlify/vue-i18n-core are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the entry function: handleFlatJson. An attacker can supply a payload with Object.prototype setter to introduce or modify properties within the global prototype chain, causing denial of service (DoS) a the minimum consequence. Moreover, the consequences of this vulnerability can escalate to other injection-based attacks, depending on how the library integrates within the application. For instance, if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), it could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the application's context.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27597", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-15  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 3  2025-04-08  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/security/advisories/GHSA-p2ph-7g93-hw3m", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution in `handleFlatJson` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 intlify/vue-i18n \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/commit/4bb6eacda7fc2cde5687549afa0efb27ca40862a", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
