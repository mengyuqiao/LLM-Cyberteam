{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27785", "Description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to arbitrary file read in train.py's `export_index` function. This issue may lead to reading arbitrary files on the Applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with blind server-side request forgery to read files from servers on the internal network that the Applio server has access to. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27785", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-09  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 3  2025-04-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 6  2025-03-25  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2025-03-23  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2025-03-22  0.06%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 9  2025-03-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-341_GHSL-2024-353_Applio/", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6rp-Q3Ddo93y09pp9RUjT2trkmM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/train/train.py#L273", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/train/train.py#L816", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
