{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27609", "Description": "Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. A vulnerability in versions prior to 2.11.5 and 2.12.13 allows an attacker to craft a request that, once transmitted to a victim's Icinga Web, allows to embed arbitrary Javascript into it and to act on behalf of that user. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.11.5 and 2.12.3 of Icinga Web 2. As a workaround, those who have Icinga Web 2.12.2 may enable a content security policy in the application settings. Any modern browser with a working CORS implementation also sufficiently guards against the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27609", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-02  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-27  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-04-01  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 6  2025-03-28  0.02%  0.06%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.11.5", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BSSnIou4XOwSjzqLgwYLnlZOlGI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.12.3", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dr0qwB3_0CCmYTpTrd1U2hLhpRA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/security/advisories/GHSA-5cjw-fwjc-8j38", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
