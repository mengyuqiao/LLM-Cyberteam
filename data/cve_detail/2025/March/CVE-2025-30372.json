{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30372", "Description": "Emlog is an open source website building system. Emlog Pro versions pro-2.5.7 and pro-2.5.8 contain an SQL injection vulnerability. `search_controller.php` does not use addslashes after urldecode, allowing the preceeding addslashes to be bypassed by URL double encoding. This could result in potential leakage of sensitive information from the user database. Version pro-2.5.9 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30372", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nEmlog\u00bbEmlogVersions  from including (>=) pro-2.5.7andbefore (<) pro-2.5.9cpe:2.3:a:emlog:emlog:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEmlog\u00bbEmlog\u00bb     PROEditionVersions  before (<) 2.5.9cpe:2.3:a:emlog:emlog:*:*:*:*:pro:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-04-29  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-04-15  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 \n 5  2025-04-03  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/emlog/emlog/security/advisories/GHSA-w6xc-r6x5-m77c", "ref_desc": "Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
