An attacker may be able to get read-only access to environment variables. This bug has been patched in v2.1.2. For those who are already using v2 of Shescape, no further changes are required. Those who are are using v1 of Shescape should follow the migration guide to upgrade to v2. There is no plan to release a patch compatible with v1 of Shescape. As a workaround, users can remove all instances of `%` from user input before using Shescape.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30222", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-26  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-31  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/commit/0a81f1eb077bab8caae283a2490cd7be9af179c6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v2.1.2", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-66pp-5p9w-q87j", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/1916", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
