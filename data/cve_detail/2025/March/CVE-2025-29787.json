{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29787", "Description": "`zip` is a zip library for rust which supports reading and writing of simple ZIP files. In the archive extraction routine of affected versions of the `zip` crate starting with version 1.3.0 and prior to version 2.3.0, symbolic links earlier in the archive are allowed to be used for later files in the archive without validation of the final canonicalized path, allowing maliciously crafted archives to overwrite arbitrary files in the file system when extracted. Users who extract untrusted archive files using the following high-level API method may be affected and critical files on the system may be overwritten with arbitrary file permissions, which can potentially lead to code execution. Version 2.3.0 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29787", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-24  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-04-18  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 5  2025-03-23  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/61/UNIX-Symbolic-Link-Symlink-Following.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-180 Incorrect Behavior Order: Validate Before Canonicalize", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/180/Incorrect-Behavior-Order-Validate-Before-Canonicalize.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/releases/tag/v2.3.0", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/commit/a2e062f37066c3b12860a32eb1cb44856cfb7afe", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 zip-rs/zip2@a2e062f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/security/advisories/GHSA-94vh-gphv-8pm8", "ref_desc": "Incorrect path canonicalization during Archive Extraction Leading to Arbitrary File Write \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zip-rs/zip2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/eternal-flame-AD/bf71ef4f6828e741eb12ce7fd47b7b85", "ref_desc": "zip_crate_slip.rs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
