{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25185", "Description": "GPT Academic provides interactive interfaces for large language models. In 3.91 and earlier, GPT Academic does not properly account for soft links. An attacker can create a malicious file as a soft link pointing to a target file, then package this soft link file into a tar.gz file and upload it. Subsequently, when accessing the decompressed file from the server, the soft link will point to the target file on the victim server. The vulnerability allows attackers to read all files on the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25185", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-10  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-04  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 6  2025-03-08  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic/security/advisories/GHSA-gqp5-wm97-qxcv", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic/commit/5dffe8627f681d7006cebcba27def038bb691949", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
