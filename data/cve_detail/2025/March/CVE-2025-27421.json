{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27421", "Description": "Abacus is a highly scalable and stateless counting API. A critical goroutine leak vulnerability has been identified in the Abacus server's Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation. The issue occurs when clients disconnect from the /stream endpoint, as the server fails to properly clean up resources and terminate associated goroutines. This leads to resource exhaustion where the server continues running but eventually stops accepting new SSE connections while maintaining high memory usage. The vulnerability specifically involves improper channel cleanup in the event handling mechanism, causing goroutines to remain blocked indefinitely. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27421", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-10  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-04  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/772/Missing-Release-of-Resource-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/security/advisories/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8", "ref_desc": "Goroutine Leak in Abacus SSE Implementation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 JasonLovesDoggo/abacus \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/commit/898ff1204e11317cc161240b660e63eed5a72b33", "ref_desc": "Fix: Resolve SSE connection leaks and enhance stability (security) \u00b7 JasonLovesDoggo/abacus@898ff12 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
