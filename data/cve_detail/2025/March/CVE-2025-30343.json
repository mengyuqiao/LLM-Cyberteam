{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30343", "Description": "A directory traversal issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. Files can be uploaded to OpenSlides meetings and organized in folders. The interface allows users to download a ZIP archive that contains all files in a folder and its subfolders. If an attacker specifies the title of a file or folder as a relative or absolute path (e.g., ../../../etc/passwd), the ZIP archive generated for download converts that title into a path. Depending on the extraction tool used by the user, this might overwrite files locally outside of the chosen directory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30343", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nOpenslides\u00bbOpenslidesVersions  before (<) 4.2.5cpe:2.3:a:openslides:openslides:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-28  0.22%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 2  2025-05-02  0.21%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-04-22  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.18%  0.15%  -0.03 \n 6  2025-03-28  0.10%  0.18%  +0.09 \n 7  2025-03-27  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 8  2025-03-23  0.16%  0.11%  -0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-24 Path Traversal: '../filedir'", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/24/Path-Traversal-..-filedir-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2025-001-OpenSlides", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/A_EVbXeAyjKdxmKdd9pVWms3PwU.html"}]}
