{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27553", "Description": "Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0.\n\nThe FileObject API in Commons VFS has a 'resolveFile' method that\ntakes a 'scope' parameter. Specifying 'NameScope.DESCENDENT' promises that \"an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of\nthe base file\". However, when the path contains encoded \"..\"\ncharacters (for example, \"%2E%2E/bar.txt\"), it might return file objects that are not\na descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.\nThis issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27553", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCommons VfsVersions  before (<) 2.10.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:commons_vfs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-30  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-17  0.19%  0.12%  -0.07 \n 3  2025-04-24  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-04-15  0.15%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2025-04-03  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-30  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 7  2025-03-29  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 8  2025-03-27  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 \n 9  2025-03-25  0.02%  0.05%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/23/1", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/04/msg00006.html", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/cnzqowyw9r2pl263cylmxhnvh41hyjcb", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
