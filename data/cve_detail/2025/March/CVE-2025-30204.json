{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30204", "Description": "golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Starting in version 3.2.0 and prior to versions 5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer  followed by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This issue is fixed in 5.2.2 and 4.5.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30204", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-22  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-15  0.07%  0.02%  -0.05 \n 3  2025-04-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-04-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 7  2025-03-27  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2025-03-24  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-405 Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/405/Asymmetric-Resource-Consumption-Amplification-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/commit/0951d184286dece21f73c85673fd308786ffe9c3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/commit/bf316c48137a1212f8d0af9288cc9ce8e59f1afb", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-mh63-6h87-95cp", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250404-0002/", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
