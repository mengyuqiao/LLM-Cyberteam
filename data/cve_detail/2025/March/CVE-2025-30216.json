{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30216", "Description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a Heap Overflow vulnerability occurs in the `Crypto_TM_ProcessSecurity` function (`crypto_tm.c:1735:8`). When processing the Secondary Header Length of a TM protocol packet, if the Secondary Header Length exceeds the packet's total length, a heap overflow is triggered during the memcpy operation that copies packet data into the dynamically allocated buffer `p_new_dec_frame`. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability. A patch is available at commit 810fd66d592c883125272fef123c3240db2f170f.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30216", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.3cpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibVersions  before (<) 1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.87% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-01  1.79%  1.87%  +0.08 \n 2  2025-05-15  1.24%  1.79%  +0.55 \n 3  2025-05-07  0.29%  1.24%  +0.96 \n 4  2025-04-26  0.26%  0.29%  +0.02 \n 5  2025-04-19  0.20%  0.26%  +0.07 \n 6  2025-04-12  0.14%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 7  2025-03-31  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 8  2025-03-27  0.07%  0.12%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-v3jc-5j74-hcjv", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49cea04-ce84-4d60-bb3a-987e843f09c4", "ref_desc": "Broken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/810fd66d592c883125272fef123c3240db2f170f", "ref_desc": "Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
