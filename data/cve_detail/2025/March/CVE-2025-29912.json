{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29912", "Description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, an unsigned integer underflow in the `Crypto_TC_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib leads to a heap buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when the `fl` (frame length) field in a Telecommand (TC) packet is set to 0. This underflow causes the frame length to be interpreted as 65535, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access. This critical vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially achieve remote code execution. Users of CryptoLib are advised to apply the recommended patch or avoid processing untrusted TC packets until a fix is available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29912", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibVersions  before (<) 1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.3cpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-24  0.39%  0.41%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-05-08  0.22%  0.39%  +0.17 \n 3  2025-04-18  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.17%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.20%  0.17%  -0.04 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.15%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 7  2025-03-20  0.27%  0.15%  -0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/ca39cb96f21e76102aefb956d2c8c0ba0bd143ca", "ref_desc": "TC_process underflow resolved \u00b7 nasa/CryptoLib@ca39cb9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-3f5x-r59x-p8cf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
