{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29909", "Description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in CryptoLib's `Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity()` allows an attacker to craft a malicious TC frame that causes out-of-bounds memory writes. This can result in denial of service (DoS) or, under certain conditions, remote code execution (RCE). Any application or system that relies on CryptoLib for Telecommand (TC) processing and does not strictly validate incoming TC frames is at risk. This includes satellite ground stations or mission control software where attackers can inject malformed frames. A patch is available at commit c7e8a8745ff4b5e9bd7e500e91358e86d5abedcc.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29909", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibVersions  before (<) 1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNasa\u00bbCryptolibVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.3cpe:2.3:a:nasa:cryptolib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-24  0.39%  0.41%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-05-01  0.22%  0.39%  +0.17 \n 3  2025-04-18  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.17%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.20%  0.17%  -0.04 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.15%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 7  2025-03-20  0.27%  0.15%  -0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/c7e8a8745ff4b5e9bd7e500e91358e86d5abedcc", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'advisory-fix-1' of https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib-gh\u2026 \u00b7 nasa/CryptoLib@c7e8a87 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-q2pc-c3jx-3852", "ref_desc": "Heap Buffer Overflow in CryptoLib\u2019s Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nasa/CryptoLib \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
