{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27780", "Description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization in model_information.py. `model_name` in model_information.py takes user-supplied input (e.g. a path to a model) and pass that value to the `run_model_information_script` and later to `model_information` function, which loads that model with `torch.load` in rvc/train/process/model_information.py (on line 16 in 3.2.8-bugfix), which is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The issue can lead to remote code execution. A patch is available in the `main` branch of the repository.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27780", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.31%  0.33%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-20  0.29%  0.31%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.29%  0.26%  -0.03 \n 5  2025-03-25  0.22%  0.29%  +0.07 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.35%  0.22%  -0.13 \n 7  2025-03-22  0.22%  0.35%  +0.13 \n 8  2025-03-21  0.35%  0.22%  -0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-341_GHSL-2024-353_Applio/", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6rp-Q3Ddo93y09pp9RUjT2trkmM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/rvc/train/process/model_information.py#L16", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/extra/model_information.py#L11-L16", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/commit/11d139508d615a6db4d48b76634a443c66170dda", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vam4ADOz-UM3oq5l754h8W7V7y0.html"}]}
