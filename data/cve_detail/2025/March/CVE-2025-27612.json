{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27612", "Description": "libcontainer is a library for container control. Prior to libcontainer 0.5.3, while creating a tenant container, the tenant builder accepts a list of capabilities to be added in the spec of tenant container. The logic here adds the given capabilities to all capabilities of main container if present in spec, otherwise simply set provided capabilities as capabilities of the tenant container. However, setting inherited caps in any case for tenant container can lead to elevation of capabilities, similar to CVE-2022-29162. This does not affect youki binary itself. This is only applicable if you are using libcontainer directly and using the tenant builder.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27612", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-27  0.01%  0.02%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-23  0.01%  0.01%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/youki-dev/youki/blob/9e63fa4da1672a78ca45100f3059a732784a5174/crates/libcontainer/src/container/tenant_builder.rs#L408", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/youki-dev/youki/commit/747e342d2026fbf3a395db3e2a491ebef00082f1", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/youki-dev/youki/security/advisories/GHSA-5w4j-f78p-4wh9", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66", "ref_desc": "Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencontainers/runc \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zWoxDw5o-TjacGwdKm1BDURhxRU.html"}]}
