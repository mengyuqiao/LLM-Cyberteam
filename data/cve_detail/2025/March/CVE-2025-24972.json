{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24972", "Description": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to versions `3.3.4` on the `stable` branch and `3.4.0.beta5` on the `beta` branch, in specific circumstances, users could be added to group direct messages despite disabling direct messaging in their preferences. Versions `3.3.4` and `3.4.0.beta5` contain a patch for the issue. A workaround is available. If a user disables chat in their preferences then they cannot be added to new group chats.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24972", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-02  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-04-27  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-04-01  0.02%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.02%  0.02%  0.00 \n 6  2025-03-28  0.03%  0.02%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-4p63-qw6g-4mv2", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
