{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27423", "Description": "Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Vim is distributed with the tar.vim plugin, that allows easy editing and viewing of (compressed or uncompressed) tar files. Starting with 9.1.0858, the tar.vim plugin uses the \":read\" ex command line to append below the cursor position, however the is not sanitized and is taken literally from the tar archive. This allows to execute shell commands via special crafted tar archives. Whether this really happens, depends on the shell being used ('shell' option, which is set using $SHELL). The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1164", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27423", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-15  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-05-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-05-03  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-04-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 7  2025-03-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 8  2025-03-27  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 9  2025-03-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 10  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/129a8446d23cd9cb4445fcfea259cba5e0487d29", "ref_desc": "runtime(tar): Update tar.vim to support permissions \u00b7 vim/vim@129a844 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-wfmf-8626-q3r3", "ref_desc": "potential code execution with tar.vim and special crafted tar files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vim/vim \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/334a13bff78aa0ad206bc436885f63e3a0bab399", "ref_desc": "patch 9.1.1164: [security]: code execution with tar.vim and special c\u2026 \u00b7 vim/vim@334a13b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250502-0002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2025-27423 Vim Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
