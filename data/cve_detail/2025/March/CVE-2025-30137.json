The GNET mobile application contains hardcoded credentials that provide unauthorized access to the dashcam's API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092. Once the GNET SSID is connected to, the attacker sends a crafted authentication command with TibetList and 000000 to list settings of the dashcam at port 9091. There's a separate set of credentials for port 9092 (stream) that is also exposed in cleartext: admin + tibet. For settings, the required credentials are adim + 000000.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30137", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-25  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-19  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-04-12  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.08%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 6  2025-03-26  0.03%  0.08%  +0.05 \n 7  2025-03-24  0.03%  0.03%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/geo-chen/GNET", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-97FqjNeZ3CEVunqZIjxUCGGp18.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gnetsystem.com/eng/product/list?viewMode=view&idx=246&ca_id=0201", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VYs5kn4CoZKeWX2MKoVeDptPgBw.html"}]}
