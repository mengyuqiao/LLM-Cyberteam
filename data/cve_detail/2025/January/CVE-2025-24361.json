{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24361", "Description": "Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Source code may be stolen during dev when using version 3.0.0 through 3.15.12 of the webpack builder or version 3.12.2 through 3.152 of the rspack builder and a victim opens a malicious web site. Because the request for classic script by a script tag is not subject to same origin policy, an attacker can inject a malicious script in their site and run the script. By using `Function::toString` against the values in `window.webpackChunknuxt_app`, the attacker can get the source code. Version 3.15.13 of Nuxt patches this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24361", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-749 Exposed Dangerous Method or Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/749/Exposed-Dangerous-Method-or-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/security/advisories/GHSA-4gf7-ff8x-hq99", "ref_desc": "Opening a malicious website while running a Nuxt dev server could allow read-only access to code \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nuxt/nuxt \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/commit/7eeb910bf4accb1e0193b9178c746f06ad3dd88f", "ref_desc": "fix(vite,webpack): restrict access via cors to local origins + allow \u2026 \u00b7 nuxt/nuxt@7eeb910 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KVmw4NJkEfXz_fkgZ5WqLDiDT8k.html"}]}
