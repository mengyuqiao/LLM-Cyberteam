{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24020", "Description": "WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. An Open Redirect vulnerability was identified in the `control.php` endpoint of versions up to and including 3.2.10 of the WeGIA application. The vulnerability allows the `nextPage` parameter to be manipulated, redirecting authenticated users to arbitrary external URLs without validation. The issue stems from the lack of validation for the `nextPage` parameter, which accepts external URLs as redirection destinations. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform phishing attacks or redirect users to malicious websites. Version 3.2.11 contains a fix for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24020", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nWegia\u00bbWegiaVersions  before (<) 3.2.11cpe:2.3:a:wegia:wegia:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-02-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/commit/89d98bf074cebf6c4ed95fca6f64e325c0b1d2f0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #900 from LabRedesCefetRJ/equipeLaje-250120 \u00b7 LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA@89d98bf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/releases/tag/v3.2.11", "ref_desc": "Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/security/advisories/GHSA-27g8-5q48-xmw6", "ref_desc": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in WeGIA \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
