{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23084", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, specifically affecting the handling of drive names in the Windows environment. Certain Node.js functions do not treat drive names as special on Windows. As a result, although Node.js assumes a relative path, it actually refers to the root directory.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, a path that does not start with the file separator is treated as relative to the current directory. \r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects Windows users of `path.join` API.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23084", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.02%  0.02%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.03 \n 3  2025-01-29  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/january-2025-security-releases", "ref_desc": "Node.js \u2014 Tuesday, January 21, 2025 Security ReleasesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mudg_fdrI9blFMgx7ct3_1nf-YU.html"}]}
