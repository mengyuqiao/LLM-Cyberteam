{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24013", "Description": "CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. Prior to 4.5.8, CodeIgniter lacked proper header validation for its name and value. The potential attacker can construct deliberately malformed headers with Header class. This could disrupt application functionality, potentially causing errors or generating invalid HTTP requests. In some cases, these malformed requests might lead to a DoS scenario if a remote service\u2019s web application firewall interprets them as malicious and blocks further communication with the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24013", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wxmh-65f7-jcvw", "ref_desc": "Improper header name validation in guzzlehttp/psr7 \u00b7 CVE-2023-29197 \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IsBlF3vNiqyosADdhC7eFljyaew.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/security/advisories/GHSA-x5mq-jjr3-vmx6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/commit/5f8aa24280fb09947897d6b322bf1f0e038b13b6", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4@5f8aa24 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2", "ref_desc": "RFC 7230 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
