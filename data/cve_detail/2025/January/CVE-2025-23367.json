{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23367", "Description": "A flaw was found in the Wildfly Server Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provider. When authorization to control management operations is secured using the Role Based Access Control provider, a user without the required privileges can suspend or resume the server. A user with a Monitor or Auditor role is supposed to have only read access permissions and should not be able to suspend the server. \nThe vulnerability is caused by the Suspend and Resume handlers not performing authorization checks to validate whether the current user has the required permissions to proceed with the action.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23367", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2337620", "ref_desc": "2337620 \u2013 (CVE-2025-23367) CVE-2025-23367 org.wildfly.core:wildfly-server: Wildfly improper RBAC permission", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-23367", "ref_desc": "CVE-2025-23367 - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qr6x-62gq-4ccp", "ref_desc": "WildFly improper RBAC permission \u00b7 CVE-2025-23367 \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
