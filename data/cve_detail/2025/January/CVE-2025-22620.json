{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-22620", "Description": "gitoxide is an implementation of git written in Rust. Prior to 0.17.0, gix-worktree-state specifies 0777 permissions when checking out executable files, intending that the umask will restrict them appropriately. But one of the strategies it uses to set permissions is not subject to the umask. This causes files in a repository to be world-writable in some situations. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.17.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22620", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-23  0.01%  0.19%  +0.18 \n 2  2025-03-20  0.15%  0.01%  -0.14 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.15%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-687 Function Call With Incorrectly Specified Argument Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/687/Function-Call-With-Incorrectly-Specified-Argument-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-fqmf-w4xh-33rh", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
