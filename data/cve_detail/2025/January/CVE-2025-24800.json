{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24800", "Description": "Hyperbridge is a hyper-scalable coprocessor for verifiable, cross-chain interoperability. A critical vulnerability was discovered in the ismp-grandpa crate, that allowed a malicious prover easily convince the verifier of the finality of arbitrary headers. This could be used to steal funds or compromise other kinds of cross-chain applications. This vulnerability is fixed in 15.0.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24800", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/security/advisories/GHSA-wwx5-gpgr-vxr7", "ref_desc": "Critical vulnerability in ismp-grandpa <v15.0.1 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 polytope-labs/hyperbridge \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/pull/372/commits/f0e85db718f5165b06585a49b14a66f8ad643aea", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/polytope-labs/ismp-substrate/pull/64/commits/5ca3351a19151f1a439c30d5cbdbfdc72a11f1a8#diff-3835cc24fb2011b3e8246036059acd8c2c2a9a869eedf7a210d18edb6543318dL262", "ref_desc": "Grandpa Client Implementation by dharjeezy \u00b7 Pull Request #64 \u00b7 polytope-labs/ismp-substrate \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
