{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23208", "Description": "zot is a production-ready vendor-neutral OCI image registry. The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so group revocations/removals are ignored in the API. SetUserGroups is alled on login, but instead of replacing the group memberships, they are appended. This may be due to some conflict with the group definitions in the config file, but that wasn't obvious to me if it were the case. Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23208", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/project-zot/zot/security/advisories/GHSA-c9p4-xwr9-rfhx", "ref_desc": "IdP group membership revocation ignored \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 project-zot/zot \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/5e30fec65c49e3139907e2819ccb39b2e3bd784e/pkg/meta/boltdb/boltdb.go#L1665", "ref_desc": "zot/pkg/meta/boltdb/boltdb.go at 5e30fec65c49e3139907e2819ccb39b2e3bd784e \u00b7 project-zot/zot \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/project-zot/zot/commit/002ac62d8a15bf0cba010b3ba7bde86f9837b613", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 project-zot/zot@002ac62 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
