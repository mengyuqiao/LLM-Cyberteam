{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23113", "Description": "An issue was discovered in REDCap 14.9.6. It has an action=myprojects&logout=1 CSRF issue in the alert-title while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert configuration. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing an HTML injection payload in the alert-title. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to view the uploaded data. If the victim click on the alert-title value, it can trigger a logout request and terminates their session, or redirect to a phishing website. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23113", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nVanderbilt\u00bbRedcap\u00bbVersion:14.9.6cpe:2.3:a:vanderbilt:redcap:14.9.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.02%  -0.04 \n 3  2025-02-26  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ping-oui-no/Vulnerability-Research-CVESS/blob/main/RedCap/CVE_XXX/README.md", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability-Research-CVESS/RedCap/CVE_XXX/README.md at main \u00b7 ping-oui-no/Vulnerability-Research-CVESS \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
