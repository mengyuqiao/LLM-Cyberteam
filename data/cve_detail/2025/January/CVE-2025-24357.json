{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24357", "Description": "vLLM is a library for LLM inference and serving. vllm/model_executor/weight_utils.py implements hf_model_weights_iterator to load the model checkpoint, which is downloaded from huggingface. It uses the torch.load function and the weights_only parameter defaults to False. When torch.load loads malicious pickle data, it will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. This vulnerability is fixed in v0.7.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24357", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/12366", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/d3d6bb13fb62da3234addf6574922a4ec0513d04", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-rh4j-5rhw-hr54", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
