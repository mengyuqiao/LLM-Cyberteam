{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23086", "Description": "On most desktop platforms, Brave Browser versions 1.70.x-1.73.x included a feature to show a site's origin on the OS-provided file selector dialog when a site prompts the user to upload or download a file. However the origin was not correctly inferred in some cases. When combined with an open redirector vulnerability on a trusted site, this could allow a malicious site to initiate a download whose origin in the file select dialog appears as the trusted site which initiated the redirect.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23086", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-24  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 \n 2  2025-03-23  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 \n 4  2025-02-19  0.06%  0.04%  -0.02 \n 5  2025-01-22  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/2888770", "ref_desc": "Brave Software | Report #2888770 - Incorrect security UI of files' download source on brave MacOS | HackerOne", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
