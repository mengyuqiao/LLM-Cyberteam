{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23222", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Deepin dde-api-proxy through 1.0.19 in which unprivileged users can access D-Bus services as root. Specifically, dde-api-proxy runs as root and forwards messages from arbitrary local users to legacy D-Bus methods in the actual D-Bus services, and the actual D-Bus services don't know about the proxy situation (they believe that root is asking them to do things). Consequently several proxied methods, that shouldn't be accessible to non-root users, are accessible to non-root users. In situations where Polkit is involved, the caller would be treated as admin, resulting in a similar escalation of privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23222", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.02%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-940 Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/940/Improper-Verification-of-Source-of-a-Communication-Channel.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.opensuse.org/2025/01/24/dde-api-proxy-privilege-escalation.html", "ref_desc": "dde-api-proxy: Authentication Bypass in Deepin D-Bus Proxy Service (CVE-2025-23222) | SUSE Security Team Blog", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1229918", "ref_desc": "1229918 \u2013 (CVE-2025-23222) AUDIT-TRACKER: CVE-2025-23222: deepin-api-proxy: new dbus services of deepin-api-proxy", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/24/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - dde-api-proxy: Authentication Bypass in Deepin D-Bus Proxy Service (CVE-2025-23222)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
