{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-22150", "Description": "Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client. Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior to versions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3, undici uses `Math.random()` to choose the boundary for a multipart/form-data request. It is known that the output of `Math.random()` can be predicted if several of its generated values are known. If there is a mechanism in an app that sends multipart requests to an attacker-controlled website, they can use this to leak the necessary values. Therefore, an attacker can tamper with the requests going to the backend APIs if certain conditions are met. This is fixed in versions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3. As a workaround, do not issue multipart requests to attacker controlled servers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22150", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-24  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-23  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312", "ref_desc": "Just a moment...", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/8b06b8250907d92fead664b3368f1d2aa27c1f35/lib/web/fetch/body.js#L113", "ref_desc": "undici/lib/web/fetch/body.js at 8b06b8250907d92fead664b3368f1d2aa27c1f35 \u00b7 nodejs/undici \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.securityevaluators.com/hacking-the-javascript-lottery-80cc437e3b7f", "ref_desc": "Hacking the JavaScript Lottery.
