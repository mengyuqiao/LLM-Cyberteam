{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24858", "Description": "Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.3.1 allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to obtain the hashed password of the system user. The hash algorithm used by Develocity was chosen according to best practices for password storage and provides some protection against brute-force attempts. The applicable severity of this vulnerability depends on whether a Develocity server is accessible by external or unauthorized users, and the complexity of the System User password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24858", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-23  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-22  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2025-03-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/201/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-Into-Sent-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gradle.com/advisory/2025-01", "ref_desc": "Develocity - Security Advisories | Gradle Inc.", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
