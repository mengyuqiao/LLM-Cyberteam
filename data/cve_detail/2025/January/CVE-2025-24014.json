{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24014", "Description": "Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A segmentation fault was found in Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn't show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated (since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24014", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.03%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-j3g9-wg22-v955", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/20/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Subject: [vim-security] segmentation fault in win_line() in Vim < 9.1.1043", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250314-0005/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2025-24014 Vim Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/9d1bed5eccdbb46a26b8a484f5e9163c40e63919", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/21/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: Subject: [vim-security] segmentation fault in win_line() in Vim < 9.1.1043", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
