{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21643", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfs: Fix kernel async DIO\n\nNetfslib needs to be able to handle kernel-initiated asynchronous DIO that\nis supplied with a bio_vec[] array.  Currently, because of the async flag,\nthis gets passed to netfs_extract_user_iter() which throws a warning and\nfails because it only handles IOVEC and UBUF iterators.  This can be\ntriggered through a combination of cifs and a loopback blockdev with\nsomething like:\n\n        mount //my/cifs/share /foo\n        dd if=/dev/zero of=/foo/m0 bs=4K count=1K\n        losetup --sector-size 4096 --direct-io=on /dev/loop2046 /foo/m0\n        echo hello >/dev/loop2046\n\nThis causes the following to appear in syslog:\n\n        WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 109 at fs/netfs/iterator.c:50 netfs_extract_user_iter+0x170/0x250 [netfs]\n\nand the write to fail.\n\nFix this by removing the check in netfs_unbuffered_write_iter_locked() that\ncauses async kernel DIO writes to be handled as userspace writes.  Note\nthat this change relies on the kernel caller maintaining the existence of\nthe bio_vec array (or kvec[] or folio_queue) until the op is complete.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21643", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3f6bc9e3ab9b127171d39f9ac6eca1abb693b731", "ref_desc": "netfs: Fix kernel async DIO - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f3a265836844eda30bf34c2584b8011fd4f0f49", "ref_desc": "netfs: Fix kernel async DIO - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
