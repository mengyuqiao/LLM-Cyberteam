{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-22149", "Description": "JWK Set (JSON Web Key Set) is a JWK and JWK Set Go implementation. Prior to 0.6.0, the project's provided HTTP client's local JWK Set cache should do a full replacement when the goroutine refreshes the remote JWK Set. The current behavior is to overwrite or append. This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation. The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version v0.5.0 and fixed in v0.6.0. The only workaround would be to remove the provided auto-caching HTTP client and replace it with a custom implementation. This involves setting the HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval to zero (or not specifying the value).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22149", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-672 Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/672/Operation-on-a-Resource-after-Expiration-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/issues/40", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/security/advisories/GHSA-675f-rq2r-jw82", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/commit/01db49a90f7f20c7fb39a699a2f19a7a5f379ed3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
