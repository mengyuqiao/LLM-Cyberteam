{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23215", "Description": "PMD is an extensible multilanguage static code analyzer. The passphrase for the PMD and PMD Designer release signing keys are included in jar published to Maven Central. The private key itself is not known to have been compromised itself, but given its passphrase is, it must also be considered potentially compromised. As a mitigation, both compromised keys have been revoked so that no future use of the keys are possible. Note, that the published artifacts in Maven Central under the group id net.sourceforge.pmd are not compromised and the signatures are valid.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23215", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-540 Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/540/Inclusion-of-Sensitive-Information-in-Source-Code.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pmd/pmd/security/advisories/GHSA-88m4-h43f-wx84", "ref_desc": "Release key passphrase (GPG) available on Maven Central in cleartext \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pmd/pmd \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/commit/1548f5f27ba2981b890827fecbd0612fa70a0362", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/commit/e87a45312753ec46b3e5576c6f6ac1f7de2f5891", "ref_desc": "Explicitly add designer.properties \u00b7 pmd/pmd-designer@e87a453 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
