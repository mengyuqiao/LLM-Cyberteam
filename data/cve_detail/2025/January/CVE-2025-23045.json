{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23045", "Description": "Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. An attacker with an account on an affected CVAT instance is able to run arbitrary code in the context of the Nuclio function container. This vulnerability affects CVAT deployments that run any of the serverless functions of type tracker from the CVAT Git repository, namely TransT and SiamMask. Deployments with custom functions of type tracker may also be affected, depending on how they handle state serialization. If a function uses an unsafe serialization library such as pickle or jsonpickle, it's likely to be vulnerable. Upgrade to CVAT 2.26.0 or later. If you are unable to upgrade, shut down any instances of the TransT or SiamMask functions you're running.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23045", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/563e1dfde64b15fa042b23f9d09cd854b35f0366", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 cvat-ai/cvat@563e1df \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/security/advisories/GHSA-wq36-mxf8-hv62", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution via tracker Nuclio functions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cvat-ai/cvat \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
