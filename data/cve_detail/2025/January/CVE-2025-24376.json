{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24376", "Description": "kubewarden-controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you to dynamically register Kubewarden admission policies. By design, AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup can evaluate only namespaced resources. The resources to be evaluated are determined by the rules provided by the user when defining the policy. There might be Kubernetes namespaced resources that should not be validated by AdmissionPolicy and by the AdmissionPolicyGroup policies because of their sensitive nature. For example, PolicyReport are namespaced resources that contain the list of non compliant objects found inside of a namespace. An attacker can use either an AdmissionPolicy or an AdmissionPolicyGroup to prevent the creation and update of PolicyReport objects to hide non-compliant resources. Moreover, the same attacker might use a mutating AdmissionPolicy to alter the contents of the PolicyReport created inside of the namespace. Starting from the 1.21.0 release, the validation rules applied to AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup have been tightened to prevent them from validating sensitive types of namespaced resources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24376", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-155 Improper Neutralization of Wildcards or Matching Symbols", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/155/Improper-Neutralization-of-Wildcards-or-Matching-Symbols.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/security/advisories/GHSA-fc89-jghx-8pvg", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/commit/8124039b5f0c955d0ee8c8ca12d4415282f02d2c", "ref_desc": "fix: stricter checks on AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup rules \u00b7 kubewarden/kubewarden-controller@8124039 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
