{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24027", "Description": "ps_contactinfo, a PrestaShop module for displaying store contact information, has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in versions up to and including 3.3.2. This can not be exploited in a fresh install of PrestaShop, only shops made vulnerable by third party modules are concerned. For example, if the shop has a third party module vulnerable to SQL injections, then ps_contactinfo might execute a stored cross-site scripting in formatting objects. Commit d60f9a5634b4fc2d3a8831fb08fe2e1f23cbfa39 keeps formatted addresses from displaying a XSS stored in the database, and the fix is expected to be available in version 3.3.3. No workarounds are available aside from applying the fix and keeping all modules maintained and update.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24027", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_contactinfo/commit/d60f9a5634b4fc2d3a8831fb08fe2e1f23cbfa39", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 PrestaShop/ps_contactinfo@d60f9a5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_contactinfo/security/advisories/GHSA-35pq-7pv2-2rfw", "ref_desc": "Potential XSS due to usage of the nofilter tag in template \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrestaShop/ps_contactinfo \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
