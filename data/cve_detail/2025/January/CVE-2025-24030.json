{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24030", "Description": "Envoy Gateway is an open source project for managing Envoy Proxy as a standalone or Kubernetes-based application gateway. A user with access to the Kubernetes cluster can use a path traversal attack to execute Envoy Admin interface commands on proxies managed by any version of Envoy Gateway prior to 1.2.6. The admin interface can be used to terminate the Envoy process and extract the Envoy configuration (possibly containing confidential data). Version 1.2.6 fixes the issue. As a workaround, the `EnvoyProxy` API can be used to apply a bootstrap config patch that restricts access strictly to the prometheus stats endpoint. Find below an example of such a bootstrap patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24030", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.49%  +0.45 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-419 Unprotected Primary Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/419/Unprotected-Primary-Channel.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/best_practices/edge", "ref_desc": "Configuring Envoy as an edge proxy \u2014 envoy 1.29.0-dev-2efbe2 documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/commit/3eb3301ab3dbf12b201b47bdb6074d1233be07bd", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 envoyproxy/gateway@3eb3301 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/security/advisories/GHSA-j777-63hf-hx76", "ref_desc": "Envoy Admin Interface Exposed through prometheus metrics endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/gateway \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/admin", "ref_desc": "Administration interface \u2014 envoy 1.34.0-dev-41d8cc documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
