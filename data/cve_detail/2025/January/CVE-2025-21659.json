The netlink API must ensure that\nat the very least NAPI instance belongs to the same netns as the owner\nof the genl sock.\n\nnapi_by_id() can become static now, but it needs to move because of\ndev_get_by_napi_id().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21659", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b683ba0df11ff563cc237eb1b74d6adfa77226bf", "ref_desc": "netdev: prevent accessing NAPI instances from another namespace - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d1cacd74776895f6435941f86a1130e58f6dd226", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
