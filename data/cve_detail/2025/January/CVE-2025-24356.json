{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24356", "Description": "fastd is a VPN daemon which tunnels IP packets and Ethernet frames over UDP. When receiving a data packet from an unknown IP address/port combination, fastd will assume that one of its connected peers has moved to a new address and initiate a reconnect by sending a handshake packet. This \"fast reconnect\" avoids having to wait for a session timeout (up to ~90s) until a new connection is established. Even a 1-byte UDP packet just containing the fastd packet type header can trigger a much larger handshake packet (~150 bytes of UDP payload). Including IPv4 and UDP headers, the resulting amplification factor is roughly 12-13. By sending data packets with a spoofed source address to fastd instances reachable on the internet, this amplification of UDP traffic might be used to facilitate a Distributed Denial of Service attack. This vulnerability is fixed in v23.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24356", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.18%  +0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-405 Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/405/Asymmetric-Resource-Consumption-Amplification-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/9df7e516378441d2d17b89f9db5c27c8312d8f12", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/c1a07b3f2b9066c3713c68547da700b85d60f4f7", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/ce1b79b12dbfa796743b5f3a50789ade965b7023", "ref_desc": "handshake: pass initial handshake flags to fastd_protocol::handshake_\u2026 \u00b7 neocturne/fastd@ce1b79b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/5f63fcfc18ae9cad023fa463b152d5e14192b5a8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/d03a0a17347efb5293e42fde7d982781e90f14ef", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/3940150e801d0c91460491bec32cbcc5bbc89d5f", "ref_desc": "receive: unblock unknown handshakes after successful handshake from s\u2026 \u00b7 neocturne/fastd@3940150 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/1f233bee76b722c0b3f9024f2c39c72e9f7e5843", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/security/advisories/GHSA-pggg-vpfv-4rcv", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
