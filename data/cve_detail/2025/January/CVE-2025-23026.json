{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23026", "Description": "jte (Java Template Engine) is a secure and lightweight template engine for Java and Kotlin. In affected versions Jte HTML templates with `script` tags or script attributes that include a Javascript template string (backticks) are subject to XSS. The `javaScriptBlock` and `javaScriptAttribute` methods in the `Escape` class do not escape backticks, which are used for Javascript template strings. Dollar signs in template strings should also be escaped as well to prevent undesired interpolation. HTML templates rendered by Jte's `OwaspHtmlTemplateOutput` in versions less than or equal to `3.1.15` with `script` tags or script attributes that contain Javascript template strings (backticks) are vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to version 3.1.16 or later to resolve this issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23026", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-150 Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/150/Improper-Neutralization-of-Escape-Meta-or-Control-Sequence.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/casid/jte/blob/main/jte-runtime/src/main/java/gg/jte/html/escape/Escape.java#L43-L83", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#description", "ref_desc": "Template literals (Template strings) - JavaScript | MDN", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/casid/jte/security/advisories/GHSA-vh22-6c6h-rm8q", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
