{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24886", "Description": "pwn.college is an education platform to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. Incorrect symlink checks on user specified dojos allows for users (admin not required) to perform an LFI from the CTFd container. When a user clones or updates repositories, a check is performed to see if the repository had contained any symlinks. A malicious user could craft a repository with symlinks pointed to sensitive files and then retrieve them using the CTFd website.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24886", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/61/UNIX-Symbolic-Link-Symlink-Following.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwncollege/dojo/security/advisories/GHSA-fcq8-jqq5-9xmh", "ref_desc": "Symlink LFI in Dojo repos \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pwncollege/dojo \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
