{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24783", "Description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) vulnerability in Apache Cocoon.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Cocoon: all versions.\n\nWhen a continuation is created, it gets a random identifier. Because the random number generator used to generate these identifiers was seeded with the startup time, it may not have been sufficiently unpredictable, and an attacker could use this to guess continuation ids and look up continuations they should not have had access to.\n\nAs a mitigation, you may enable the \"session-bound-continuations\" option to make sure continuations are not shared across sessions.\n\n\nAs this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24783", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-335 Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/335/Incorrect-Usage-of-Seeds-in-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/pk86jp5cvn41432op8wv1k8p14mp27nz", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/27/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2025-24783: Apache Cocoon: continuations may not be private", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
