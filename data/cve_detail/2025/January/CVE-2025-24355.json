{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24355", "Description": "Updatecli is a tool used to apply file update strategies. Prior to version 0.93.0, private maven repository credentials may be leaked in application logs in case of unsuccessful retrieval operation. During the execution of an updatecli pipeline which contains a `maven` source configured with basic auth credentials, the credentials are being leaked in the application execution logs in case of failure. Credentials are properly sanitized when the operation is successful but not when for whatever reason there is a failure in the maven repository, e.g. wrong coordinates provided, not existing artifact or version. Version 0.93.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24355", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-359 Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/359/Exposure-of-Private-Personal-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/security/advisories/GHSA-v34r-vj4r-38j6", "ref_desc": "Maven credentials exposed in console output \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 updatecli/updatecli \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/commit/344b28091ffeca5ed32e8d0f9eda542842fcd3fa", "ref_desc": "fix: hide username/password from URL in log message (#3659) \u00b7 updatecli/updatecli@344b280 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
