{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-22151", "Description": "Strawberry GraphQL is a library for creating GraphQL APIs. Starting in 0.182.0 and prior to version 0.257.0, a type confusion vulnerability exists in Strawberry GraphQL's relay integration that affects multiple ORM integrations (Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic). The vulnerability occurs when multiple GraphQL types are mapped to the same underlying model while using the relay node interface. When querying for a specific type using the global node field (e.g., FruitType:some-id), the resolver may incorrectly return an instance of a different type mapped to the same model (e.g., SpecialFruitType). This can lead to information disclosure if the alternate type exposes sensitive fields and potential privilege escalation if the alternate type contains data intended for restricted access. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.257.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22151", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-18  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/843/Access-of-Resource-Using-Incompatible-Type-Type-Confusion-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/commit/526eb82b70451c0e59d5a71ae9b7396f59974bd8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/security/advisories/GHSA-5xh2-23cc-5jc6", "ref_desc": "Type resolution vulnerability in node interface allows potential data leakage through incorrect type resolution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 strawberry-graphql/strawberry \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
