{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24359", "Description": "ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24359", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.02%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-134 Use of Externally-Controlled Format String", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/134/Use-of-Externally-Controlled-Format-String.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-749 Exposed Dangerous Method or Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/749/Exposed-Dangerous-Method-or-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/lmfit/asteval/blob/cfb57f0beebe0dc0520a1fbabc35e66060c7ea71/asteval/asteval.py#L507", "ref_desc": "asteval/asteval/asteval.py at cfb57f0beebe0dc0520a1fbabc35e66060c7ea71 \u00b7 lmfit/asteval \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format", "ref_desc": "Be Careful with Python's New-Style String Format | Armin Ronacher's Thoughts and Writings", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lmfit/asteval/security/advisories/GHSA-3wwr-3g9f-9gc7", "ref_desc": "Maliciously Crafted Format Strings Lead to Sandbox Escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 lmfit/asteval \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
