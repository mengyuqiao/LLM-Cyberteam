{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24017", "Description": "YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Versions up to and including 4.4.5 are vulnerable to any end-user crafting a DOM based XSS on all of YesWiki's pages which is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link. The vulnerability makes use of the search by tag feature. When a tag doesn't exist, the tag is reflected on the page and isn't properly sanitized on the server side which allows a malicious user to generate a link that will trigger an XSS on the client's side when clicked. This vulnerability allows any user to generate a malicious link that will trigger an account takeover when clicked, therefore allowing a user to steal other accounts, modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24017", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated DOM Based XSS in YesWiki <= 4.4.5 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 YesWiki/yeswiki \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b", "ref_desc": "fix(attach/tags): better sanitization \u00b7 YesWiki/yeswiki@c1e28b5 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DJB6vc7r0gvsGIHRsADhuenmKmg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/blob/doryphore-dev/tools/tags/handlers/page/listpages.php#L84", "ref_desc": "yeswiki/tools/tags/handlers/page/listpages.php at doryphore-dev \u00b7 YesWiki/yeswiki \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
