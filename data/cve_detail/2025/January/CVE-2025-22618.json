{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-22618", "Description": "WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `adicionar_cargo.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `cargo` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `adicionar_cargo.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.2.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22618", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nWegia\u00bbWegiaVersions  before (<) 3.2.6cpe:2.3:a:wegia:wegia:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-22  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 3  2025-02-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/commit/f3b1cd90e33b790b6b2049c69d22c6d50fe965a1", "ref_desc": "Resolu\u00e7\u00e3o XSS [Issue #849] \u00b7 LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA@f3b1cd9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/security/advisories/GHSA-2775-42rh-535q", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Stored endpoint 'adicionar_cargo.php' parameter 'cargo' \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
