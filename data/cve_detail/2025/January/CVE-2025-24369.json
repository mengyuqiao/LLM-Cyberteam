{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24369", "Description": "Anubis is a tool that allows administrators to protect bots against AI scrapers through bot-checking heuristics and a proof-of-work challenge to discourage scraping from multiple IP addresses. Anubis allows attackers to bypass the bot protection by requesting a challenge, formulates any nonce (such as 42069), and then passes the challenge with difficulty zero. Commit e09d0226a628f04b1d80fd83bee777894a45cd02 fixes this behavior by not using a client-specified difficulty value.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24369", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-807 Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/807/Reliance-on-Untrusted-Inputs-in-a-Security-Decision.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Xe/x/commit/7bd7b209f4f1b897de85ec8973458dc8be606a8b", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Xe/x/security/advisories/GHSA-56w8-8ppj-2p4f", "ref_desc": "Bot protection bypass when a sophisticated attacker asks to pass a challenge of difficulty 0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Xe/x \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Xe/x/commit/e09d0226a628f04b1d80fd83bee777894a45cd02", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://xeiaso.net/notes/2025/GHSA-56w8-8ppj-2p4f", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
