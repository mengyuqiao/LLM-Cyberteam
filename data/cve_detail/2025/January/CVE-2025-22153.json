{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-22153", "Description": "RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python language which allows to provide a program input into a trusted environment. Via a type confusion bug in versions of the CPython interpreter starting in 3.11 and prior to 3.13.2 when using `try/except*`, RestrictedPython starting in version 6.0 and prior to version 8.0 could be bypassed. The issue is patched in version 8.0 of RestrictedPython by removing support for `try/except*` clauses. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22153", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-23  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-21  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 4  2025-03-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/843/Access-of-Resource-Using-Incompatible-Type-Type-Confusion-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/commit/48a92c5bb617a647cffd0dadd4d5cfe626bcdb2f", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/security/advisories/GHSA-gmj9-h825-chq2", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
