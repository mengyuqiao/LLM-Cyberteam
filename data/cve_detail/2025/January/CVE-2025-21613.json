{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21613", "Description": "go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. An argument injection vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary values to git-upload-pack flags. This only happens when the file transport protocol is being used, as that is the only protocol that shells out to git binaries. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.13.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21613", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-25  0.17%  0.07%  -0.09 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.17%  +0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-git/go-git/security/advisories/GHSA-v725-9546-7q7m", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
