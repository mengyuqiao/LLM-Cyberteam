{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-22136", "Description": "Tabby (formerly Terminus) is a highly configurable terminal emulator. Prior to 1.0.217 , Tabby enables several high-risk Electron Fuses, including RunAsNode, EnableNodeCliInspectArguments, and EnableNodeOptionsEnvironmentVariable. These fuses create potential code injection vectors even though the application is signed with hardened runtime and lacks dangerous entitlements such as com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation and com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.217.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22136", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby/commit/93513541f7161fa8a59491603cabb6a101c0c08e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby/security/advisories/GHSA-prcj-7rvc-26h4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
