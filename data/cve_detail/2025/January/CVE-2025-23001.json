{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23001", "Description": "A Host header injection vulnerability exists in CTFd 3.7.5, due to the application failing to properly validate or sanitize the Host header. An attacker can manipulate the Host header in HTTP requests, which may lead to phishing attacks, reset password, or cache poisoning. NOTE: the Supplier's position is that the end user is supposed to edit the NGINX configuration template to set server_name (with this setting, Host header injection cannot occur).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23001", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-02-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-644 Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/644/Improper-Neutralization-of-HTTP-Headers-for-Scripting-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd", "ref_desc": "GitHub - CTFd/CTFd: CTFs as you need them", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.ctfd.io/ctfd-3-7-6/", "ref_desc": "CTFd 3.7.6", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://codetoanbug.com/poc-cve-2025-23001-ctfd-english/", "ref_desc": "POC CVE-2025-23001 CTFd 3.7.5(EN) \u2013 Code to\u00e0n bug", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
