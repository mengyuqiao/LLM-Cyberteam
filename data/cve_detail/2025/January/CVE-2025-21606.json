{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21606", "Description": "stats is a macOS system monitor in for the menu bar. The Stats application is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to the insecure implementation of its XPC service. The application registers a Mach service under the name `eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper`. The associated binary, eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper, is a privileged helper tool designed to execute actions requiring elevated privileges on behalf of the client, such as setting fan modes, adjusting fan speeds, and executing the `powermetrics` command. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `shouldAcceptNewConnection` method, which unconditionally returns YES (or true), allowing any XPC client to connect to the service without any form of verification. As a result, unauthorized clients can establish a connection to the Mach service and invoke methods exposed by the HelperTool interface. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the hardware settings of the user\u2019s device and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.21 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21606", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-26  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/exelban/stats/security/advisories/GHSA-qwhf-px96-7f6v", "ref_desc": "Local Privilege Escalation via Exposed XPC Method Due to Client Verification Failure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 exelban/stats \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/exelban/stats/commit/c10759f7a186efdd82ddd818dae2ac1f853691fc", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
