{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21611", "Description": "tgstation-server is a production scale tool for BYOND server management. Prior to 6.12.3, roles used to authorize API methods were incorrectly OR'd instead of AND'ed with the role used to determine if a user was enabled. This allows enabled users access to most, but not all, authorized actions regardless of their permissions. Notably, the WriteUsers right is unaffected so users may not use this bug to permanently elevate their account permissions. The fix is release in tgstation-server-v6.12.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21611", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-22  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2025-03-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/issues/2064", "ref_desc": "Can still read `/Repository` even when `RepositoryRights.Read` is unset \u00b7 Issue #2064 \u00b7 tgstation/tgstation-server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/commit/e7b1189620baaf03c2d23f6e164d07c7c7d87d57", "ref_desc": "Fix UserEnabled role being OR'd with action authorization roles FUUUU\u2026 \u00b7 tgstation/tgstation-server@e7b1189 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/security/advisories/GHSA-rf5r-q276-vrc4", "ref_desc": "Role authorization incorrectly OR'd with user's enabled status \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tgstation/tgstation-server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
