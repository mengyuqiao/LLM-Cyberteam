{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21593", "Description": "An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nOn devices with SRv6 (Segment Routing over IPv6) enabled, an attacker can send a malformed BGP UPDATE packet which will cause the rpd to crash and restart. Continued receipt of these UPDATE packets will cause a sustained DoS condition.\u00a0\n\nThis issue affects iBGP and eBGP, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.This issue affects Junos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S2,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2;\n\n\n\nand Junos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S10-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S5-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S2-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21593", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-664 Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/664/Improper-Control-of-a-Resource-Through-its-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA92861", "ref_desc": "2025-01 Security Bulletin: Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved: On SRv6 enabled devices, an attacker sending a malformed BGP update can cause the rpd to crash (CVE-2025-21593)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
