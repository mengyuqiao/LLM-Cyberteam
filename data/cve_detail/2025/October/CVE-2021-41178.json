{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41178", "Description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, a file traversal vulnerability makes an attacker able to download arbitrary SVG images from the host system, including user provided files. This could also be leveraged into a XSS/phishing attack, an attacker could upload a malicious SVG file that mimics the Nextcloud login form and send a specially crafted link to victims. The XSS risk here is mitigated due to the fact that Nextcloud employs a strict Content-Security-Policy disallowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5 or 22.2.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41178", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbServerVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.3andbefore (<) 20.0.13cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.1andbefore (<) 21.0.5cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbServerVersions  from including (>=) 22.1.1andbefore (<) 22.2.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-28  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-20  0.20%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-04-03  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.52%  0.18%  -0.34 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.18%  0.52%  +0.34 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.18%  +0.08 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.10%  -0.07 \n 8  2023-07-15  0.16%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-06-16  0.14%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-05-18  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.11%  -2.09 \n 12  2023-02-22  27.31%  2.20%  -25.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28726", "ref_desc": "Check if SVG path is valid by LukasReschke \u00b7 Pull Request #28726 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-jp9c-vpr3-m5rf", "ref_desc": "File Traversal affecting SVG files on Nextcloud Server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1302155", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-17) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jZHo9JiHBzcYnpiDroWdMBiDUSQ.html"}]}
