{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-35235", "Description": "The ASP.NET debug feature is enabled by default in Kiwi Syslog Server 9.7.2 and previous versions. ASP.NET allows remote debugging of web applications, if configured to do so. Debug mode causes ASP.NET to compile applications with extra information. The information enables a debugger to closely monitor and control the execution of an application. If an attacker could successfully start a remote debugging session, this is likely to disclose sensitive information about the web application and supporting infrastructure that may be valuable in targeting SWI with malicious intent.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35235", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolarwinds\u00bbKiwi Syslog ServerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.7.2cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:kiwi_syslog_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  4.32%  2.39%  -1.93 \n 2  2025-03-29  2.39%  4.32%  +1.93 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.19%  2.39%  +2.21 \n 4  2024-10-02  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-07-04  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-05-25  0.10%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-05-19  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-04-08  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.10%  -1.34 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-11 ASP.NET Misconfiguration: Creating Debug Binary", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/11/ASP.NET-Misconfiguration-Creating-Debug-Binary.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/CVE-2021-35235", "ref_desc": "SolarWinds Trust Center Security Advisories | CVE-2021-35235Release Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/kss/content/release_notes/kss_9-8_release_notes.htm", "ref_desc": "KSS 9.8 Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jEJHETHY_VTimJf9md6BEUt52c4.html"}]}
