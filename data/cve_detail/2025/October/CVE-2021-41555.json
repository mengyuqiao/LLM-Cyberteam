{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41555", "Description": "In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), XSS occurs in /archibus/dwr/call/plaincall/workflow.runWorkflowRule.dwr because the data received as input from clients is re-included within the HTTP response returned by the application without adequate validation. In this way, if HTML code or client-side executable code (e.g., Javascript) is entered as input, the expected execution flow could be altered. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41555", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nArchibus\u00bbWeb Central\u00bbVersion:21.3.3.815cpe:2.3:a:archibus:web_central:21.3.3.815:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-31  0.38%  0.40%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.33%  0.38%  +0.05 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.38%  0.33%  -0.05 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.38%  +0.31 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-09-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-06-20  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-05-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-04-28  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-03-18  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.gruppotim.it/redteam", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability Research & Advisor | Gruppo TIMThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IWMyWn1l2xYd9Klaca__AGX5aF4.html"}]}
