{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41611", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 5.0.6 through 5.1.x before 5.2. When validating an origin server or peer certificate, Squid may incorrectly classify certain certificates as trusted. This problem allows a remote server to obtain security trust well improperly. This indication of trust may be passed along to clients, allowing access to unsafe or hijacked services.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41611", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSquid-cache\u00bbSquidVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.6andbefore (<) 5.2cpe:2.3:a:squid-cache:squid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-10  2.94%  2.16%  -0.77 \n 2  2025-04-07  2.25%  2.94%  +0.68 \n 3  2025-03-30  7.95%  2.25%  -5.70 \n 4  2025-03-29  2.25%  7.95%  +5.70 \n 5  2025-03-27  2.00%  2.25%  +0.26 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.10%  2.00%  +1.90 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 8  2024-07-03  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 9  2024-05-24  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 10  2024-04-28  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-11-08  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 12  2023-05-11  0.09%  0.08%  0.00 \n 13  2023-03-31  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 14  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/changesets/squid-6-43d6b5c81b88ec2256b430c69a872a1e4f324e4a.patch", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/23/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-44273: e2guardian did not validate TLS hostnamesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/n6iuC8wPLzmNntvawrOJb7aBIXg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-47m4-g3mv-9q5r", "ref_desc": "SQUID-2021:6 Improper Certificate Validation of TLS server certificates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 squid-cache/squid \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CWQ2WKDWTSO47S3F6XJJ6HGG2ULWEAE4/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: squid-5.2-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
