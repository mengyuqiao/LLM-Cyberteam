{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41139", "Description": "Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. When a logged on user selects a date in Time Tracker, it is being passed on via the date parameter in URI. Because of not checking this parameter for sanity in versions prior to 1.19.30.5600, it was possible to craft the URI with malicious JavaScript, use social engineering to convince logged on user to click on such link, and have the attacker-supplied JavaScript to be executed in user's browser. This issue is patched in version 1.19.30.5600. As a workaround, one may introduce `ttValidDbDateFormatDate` function as in the latest version and add a call to it within the access checks block in time.php.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41139", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nAnuko\u00bbTime TrackerVersions  before (<) 1.19.30.5600cpe:2.3:a:anuko:time_tracker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-08  0.49%  0.52%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.75%  0.49%  -0.26 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.49%  0.75%  +0.26 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.49%  +0.38 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-06-28  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 7  2024-05-19  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-04-23  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-05-06  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-03-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-h2v8-87c9-86cw", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS vulnerability in time.php \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anuko/timetracker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/d3f60bd3e3ea8ff8ec31a596baec6750af601b7c", "ref_desc": "A better fix to validate a passed-in date. \u00b7 anuko/timetracker@d3f60bd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/559906731f153c9b3a632c2839ed11669b76d593", "ref_desc": "Added a check for passed in date to time.php. \u00b7 anuko/timetracker@5599067 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
