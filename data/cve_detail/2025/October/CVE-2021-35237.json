{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-35237", "Description": "A missing HTTP header (X-Frame-Options) in Kiwi Syslog Server has left customers vulnerable to click jacking. Clickjacking is an attack that occurs when an attacker uses a transparent iframe in a window to trick a user into clicking on an actionable item, such as a button or link, to another server in which they have an identical webpage. The attacker essentially hijacks the user activity intended for the original server and sends them to the other server. This is an attack on both the user and the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35237", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolarwinds\u00bbKiwi Syslog ServerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.7.2cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:kiwi_syslog_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-06-01  0.21%  0.18%  -0.03 \n 3  2025-05-15  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 4  2025-05-04  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-05-01  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-04-24  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 7  2025-03-30  0.24%  0.16%  -0.09 \n 8  2025-03-29  0.16%  0.24%  +0.09 \n 9  2025-03-20  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 10  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 11  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 12  2024-07-04  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 13  2024-05-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 14  2023-05-22  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 15  2023-04-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 16  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1021 Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1021/Improper-Restriction-of-Rendered-UI-Layers-or-Frames.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35237", "ref_desc": "SolarWinds Trust Center Security Advisories | CVE-2021-35237Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/kss/content/release_notes/kss_9-8_release_notes.htm", "ref_desc": "KSS 9.8 Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jEJHETHY_VTimJf9md6BEUt52c4.html"}]}
