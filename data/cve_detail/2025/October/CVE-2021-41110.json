Versions prior to 1.3.1 contain a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability. Commit number f6066f09edb70033a2ce80200e9fa9e70a5c29de (dated 2021-09-30) contains a patch. There are no available workarounds aside from installing the patch. The SnakeYaml constructor, by default, allows any data to be parsed. To fix the issue the object needs to be created with a `SafeConstructor` object, as seen in the patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41110", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCommonwl\u00bbCwlviewerVersions  before (<) 1.3.1cpe:2.3:a:commonwl:cwlviewer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.27%  0.61%  -0.66 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.61%  1.27%  +0.66 \n 3  2025-03-27  0.58%  0.61%  +0.03 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.74%  0.58%  -0.17 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.65%  0.74%  +0.10 \n 6  2024-08-23  0.47%  0.65%  +0.18 \n 7  2024-06-16  0.58%  0.47%  -0.11 \n 8  2024-05-07  0.48%  0.58%  +0.10 \n 9  2023-12-24  0.37%  0.48%  +0.11 \n 10  2023-12-09  0.37%  0.37%  0.00 \n 11  2023-11-11  0.38%  0.37%  0.00 \n 12  2023-10-28  0.37%  0.38%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-05-23  0.32%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 14  2023-05-09  0.24%  0.32%  +0.07 \n 15  2023-04-24  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 16  2023-03-14  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 17  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.20%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/security/advisories/GHSA-7g7j-f5g3-fqp7", "ref_desc": "CWL Viewer: deserialization of untrusted data can lead to complete takeover by an attacker \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 common-workflow-language/cwlviewer \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/commit/f6066f09edb70033a2ce80200e9fa9e70a5c29de", "ref_desc": "Use Yaml SafeConstructor (#355) \u00b7 common-workflow-language/cwlviewer@f6066f0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.fatalerrors.org/a/analysis-of-the-snakeyaml-deserialization-in-java-security.html", "ref_desc": "Analysis of the SnakeYaml deserialization in Java SecurityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
