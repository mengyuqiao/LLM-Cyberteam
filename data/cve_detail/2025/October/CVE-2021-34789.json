{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34789", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Tetration could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid administrative credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34789", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTetrationVersions  before (<) 3.5.1.31cpe:2.3:a:cisco:tetration:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.20%  0.17%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.17%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.14%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.14%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-05-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sec-work-xss-t6SYtu8Q", "ref_desc": "Cisco Tetration Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
