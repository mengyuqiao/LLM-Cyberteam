{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-42343", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42343", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAnaconda\u00bbDask\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 2021.10.0cpe:2.3:a:anaconda:dask:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-04  3.17%  3.57%  +0.40 \n 2  2025-03-30  9.61%  3.17%  -6.44 \n 3  2025-03-29  3.17%  9.61%  +6.44 \n 4  2025-03-28  3.81%  3.17%  -0.64 \n 5  2025-03-27  3.23%  3.81%  +0.58 \n 6  2025-03-17  2.23%  3.23%  +1.00 \n 7  2024-12-27  1.59%  2.23%  +0.65 \n 8  2024-12-17  2.47%  1.59%  -0.88 \n 9  2024-10-01  2.34%  2.47%  +0.13 \n 10  2024-07-11  2.19%  2.34%  +0.15 \n 11  2024-06-01  2.02%  2.19%  +0.17 \n 12  2024-05-06  1.72%  2.02%  +0.30 \n 13  2024-04-09  1.66%  1.72%  +0.06 \n 14  2023-06-17  1.21%  1.66%  +0.45 \n 15  2023-06-03  1.04%  1.21%  +0.17 \n 16  2023-05-19  0.98%  1.04%  +0.06 \n 17  2023-04-08  0.99%  0.98%  -0.02 \n 18  2023-03-07  5.63%  0.99%  -4.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dask/distributed/security/advisories/GHSA-hwqr-f3v9-hwxr", "ref_desc": "Workers for local Dask clusters mistakenly listened on public interfaces \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dask/distributed \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/changelog.html", "ref_desc": "Changelog \u2014 Dask documentationRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dask/dask/tags", "ref_desc": "Tags \u00b7 dask/dask \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
