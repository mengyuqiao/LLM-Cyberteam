{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41135", "Description": "The Cosmos-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang. Affected versions of the SDK were vulnerable to a consensus halt due to non-deterministic behaviour in a ValidateBasic method in the x/authz module. The MsgGrant of the x/authz module contains a Grant field which includes a user-defined expiration time for when the authorization grant expires. In Grant.ValidateBasic(), that time is compared to the node\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local clock time. Any chain running an affected version of the SDK with the authz module enabled could be halted by anyone with the ability to send transactions on that chain. Recovery would require applying the patch and rolling back the latest block. Users are advised to update to version 0.44.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41135", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nInterchain\u00bbCosmos SdkVersions  from including (>=) 0.43.0andbefore (<) 0.44.2cpe:2.3:a:interchain:cosmos_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.64%  0.54%  -0.10 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.54%  0.64%  +0.10 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.16%  0.54%  +0.38 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-01-12  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-06-11  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-05-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-sdk-vulnerability-retrospective-security-advisory-jackfruit-october-12-2021/5349", "ref_desc": "Cosmos-SDK Vulnerability Retrospective: Security Advisory Jackfruit, October 12, 2021 - Security - Cosmos ForumExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-2p6r-37p9-89p2", "ref_desc": "Authz Module Non-Determinism \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cosmos/cosmos-sdk \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/commit/68ab790a761e80d3674f821794cf18ccbfed45ee", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2p6r-37p9-89p2 \u00b7 cosmos/cosmos-sdk@68ab790 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
