{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41163", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions maliciously crafted requests could lead to remote code execution. This resulted from a lack of validation in subscribe_url values. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. To workaround the issue without updating, requests with a path starting /webhooks/aws path could be blocked at an upstream proxy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41163", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  before (<) 2.7.9cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta4cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta5cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta6cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta6:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "5.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  4.73%  5.17%  +0.45 \n 2  2025-06-01  5.17%  4.73%  -0.45 \n 3  2025-05-06  4.61%  5.17%  +0.56 \n 4  2025-05-04  4.73%  4.61%  -0.11 \n 5  2025-05-01  4.61%  4.73%  +0.11 \n 6  2025-04-15  5.58%  4.61%  -0.97 \n 7  2025-04-07  3.78%  5.58%  +1.80 \n 8  2025-03-30  9.04%  3.78%  -5.26 \n 9  2025-03-29  3.78%  9.04%  +5.26 \n 10  2025-03-17  2.06%  3.78%  +1.72 \n 11  2024-12-21  1.46%  2.06%  +0.60 \n 12  2024-09-25  1.38%  1.46%  +0.08 \n 13  2024-07-05  1.30%  1.38%  +0.09 \n 14  2024-05-26  1.25%  1.30%  +0.04 \n 15  2024-04-03  1.21%  1.25%  +0.04 \n 16  2023-10-05  1.17%  1.21%  +0.04 \n 17  2023-05-13  1.10%  1.17%  +0.07 \n 18  2023-05-08  0.79%  1.10%  +0.31 \n 19  2023-04-02  0.81%  0.79%  -0.01 \n 20  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.81%  -1.17 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/fa3c46cf079d28b086fe1025349bb00223a5d5e9", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Improve validation of SNS subscription confirm (#14672) \u00b7 discourse/discourse@fa3c46c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-jcjx-pvpc-qgwq", "ref_desc": "RCE via malicious SNS subscription payload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
