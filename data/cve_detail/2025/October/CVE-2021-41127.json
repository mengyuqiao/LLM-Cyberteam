{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41127", "Description": "Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in the functionality that loads a trained model `tar.gz` file which allows a malicious actor to craft a `model.tar.gz` file which can overwrite or replace bot files in the bot directory. The vulnerability is fixed in Rasa 2.8.10. For users unable to update ensure that users do not upload untrusted model files, and restrict CLI or API endpoint access where a malicious actor could target a deployed Rasa instance.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41127", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nRasa\u00bbRasaVersions  before (<) 2.8.10cpe:2.3:a:rasa:rasa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-16  0.38%  0.40%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.26%  0.38%  +0.12 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.38%  0.26%  -0.12 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.38%  +0.32 \n 5  2024-07-06  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-05-14  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 7  2023-04-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/security/advisories/GHSA-4365-fhm5-qcrx", "ref_desc": "Maliciously Crafted Model Archive Can Lead To Arbitrary File Write \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RasaHQ/rasa \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/commit/1b6b502f52d73b4f8cd1959ce724b8ad0eb33989", "ref_desc": "Swap calls to extractall for TarSafe equivalent \u00b7 RasaHQ/rasa@1b6b502 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
