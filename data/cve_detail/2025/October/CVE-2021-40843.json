{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40843", "Description": "Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server contains an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in the Web Console. An attacker with write access to the local database could cause arbitrary code to execute with SYSTEM privileges on the underlying server when a Web Console user triggers retrieval of that data. When chained with a SQL injection vulnerability, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely if Web Console users click a series of maliciously crafted URLs. All versions prior to 7.11.2 are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40843", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nProofpoint\u00bbInsider Threat Management ServerVersions  before (<) 7.11.2cpe:2.3:a:proofpoint:insider_threat_management_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.08%  0.03%  -0.05 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.08%  +0.05 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-05-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.proofpoint.com/us/security/security-advisories", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories | Proofpoint USVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qQ4NPtJgz1u8iDkQyOE7RPEwacY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.proofpoint.com/us/security/security-advisories/pfpt-sa-2021-0009", "ref_desc": "PFPT-SA-2021-0009 | Proofpoint USVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
