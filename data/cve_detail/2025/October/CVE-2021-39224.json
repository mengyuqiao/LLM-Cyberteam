{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39224", "Description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud OfficeOnline application prior to version 1.1.1 returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. (e.g. an attacker could see that the file `shared.txt` is located within `/files/$username/Myfolder/Mysubfolder/shared.txt`). It is recommended that the OfficeOnline application is upgraded to 1.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the OfficeOnline application in the app settings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39224", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbOfficeonlineVersions  before (<) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:officeonline:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-20  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.24%  0.20%  -0.04 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.20%  +0.13 \n 5  2024-07-10  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-05-31  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-05-18  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-04-07  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-56wm-r6jm-3v9h", "ref_desc": "File path disclosure of shared files in OfficeOnline application \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/officeonline/pull/204", "ref_desc": "Unify error messages accross controllers by juliushaertl \u00b7 Pull Request #204 \u00b7 nextcloud/officeonline \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
