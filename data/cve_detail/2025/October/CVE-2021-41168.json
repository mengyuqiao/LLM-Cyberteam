{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41168", "Description": "Snudown is a reddit-specific fork of the Sundown Markdown parser used by GitHub, with Python integration added. In affected versions snudown was found to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks to its reference table implementation. References written in markdown ` [reference_name]: https://www.example.com` are inserted into a hash table which was found to have a weak hash function, meaning that an attacker can reliably generate a large number of collisions for it. This makes the hash table vulnerable to a hash-collision DoS attack, a type of algorithmic complexity attack. Further the hash table allowed for duplicate entries resulting in long retrieval times. Proofs of concept and further discussion of the hash collision issue are discussed on the snudown GHSA(https://github.com/reddit/snudown/security/advisories/GHSA-6gvv-9q92-w5f6). Users are advised to update to version 1.7.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41168", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nReddit\u00bbSnudownVersions  before (<) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:reddit:snudown:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-12  0.19%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-16  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.18%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.18%  +0.13 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.05%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-05-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-407 Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/407/Inefficient-Algorithmic-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/reddit/snudown/security/advisories/GHSA-6gvv-9q92-w5f6", "ref_desc": "Hash-Collision Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in Reference Table \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 reddit/snudown \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/reddit/snudown/commit/1ac2c130b210539ee1e5d67a7bac93f9d8007c0e", "ref_desc": "Hash-collision denial-of-service vulnerabilities (#87) \u00b7 reddit/snudown@1ac2c13 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
