{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41149", "Description": "Tough provides a set of Rust libraries and tools for using and generating the update framework (TUF) repositories. The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does not properly sanitize target names when caching a repository, or when saving specific targets to an output directory. When targets are cached or saved, files could be overwritten with arbitrary content anywhere on the system. A fix is available in version 0.12.0. No workarounds to this issue are known.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41149", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbTough\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.12.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:tough:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-14  0.60%  0.63%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-03-30  1.39%  0.60%  -0.79 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.60%  1.39%  +0.79 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.08%  0.60%  +0.52 \n 5  2023-05-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/awslabs/tough/commit/1809b9bd1106d78a51fbea3071aa97a3530bac9a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-x3r5-q6mj-m485 \u00b7 awslabs/tough@1809b9b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lVGqAbKYKYndni5tBUA8hyINx0g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/awslabs/tough/security/advisories/GHSA-x3r5-q6mj-m485", "ref_desc": "Improper sanitization of target names \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 awslabs/tough \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
