{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39221", "Description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud Contacts application prior to version 4.0.3 was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Contacts application is upgraded to 4.0.3. As a workaround, one may use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39221", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbContactsVersions  before (<) 4.0.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:contacts:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-20  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.38%  0.27%  -0.12 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.27%  0.38%  +0.12 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.27%  +0.22 \n 5  2023-05-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-j6cx-mxqf-f9vc", "ref_desc": "XSS in Contacts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/pull/2407", "ref_desc": "Run SVGs through some sanitization by ChristophWurst \u00b7 Pull Request #2407 \u00b7 nextcloud/contacts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
