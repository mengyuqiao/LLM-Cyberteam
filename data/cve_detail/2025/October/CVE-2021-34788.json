{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34788", "Description": "A vulnerability in the shared library loading mechanism of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Linux and Mac OS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a shared library hijacking attack on an affected device if the VPN Posture (HostScan) Module is installed on the AnyConnect client. This vulnerability is due to a race condition in the signature verification process for shared library files that are loaded on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted interprocess communication (IPC) messages to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have a valid account on the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34788", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAnyconnect Secure Mobility ClientVersions  before (<) 4.10.03104cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.04%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-lib-hija-cAFB7x4q", "ref_desc": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Linux and Mac OS with VPN Posture (HostScan) Module Shared Library Hijacking VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
