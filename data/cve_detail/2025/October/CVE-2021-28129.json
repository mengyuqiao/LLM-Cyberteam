{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28129", "Description": "While working on Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 a developer discovered that the DEB package did not install using root, but instead used a userid and groupid of 500. This both caused issues with desktop integration and could allow a crafted attack on files owned by that user or group if they exist. Users who installed the Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 DEB packaging should upgrade to the latest version of Apache OpenOffice.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28129", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbOpenoffice\u00bbVersion:4.1.8cpe:2.3:a:apache:openoffice:4.1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-27  0.22%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.44%  0.22%  -0.21 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.22%  0.44%  +0.21 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.22%  +0.18 \n 5  2023-08-24  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 6  2023-05-29  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-05-15  0.09%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-04-30  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.09%  -1.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r9e72234dd662280fa1a3cca6164d3470a1dbc0d8e53e48ba27f787ce@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-28129: DEB packaging for Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 installed with a non-root userid and groupid - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc9090ab48b4699494b63b35cd6d7414c52d665ecae12add3cdc56c9b%40%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-28129: DEB packaging for Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 installed with a non-root userid and groupid - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/07/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-28129: DEB packaging for Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 installed with a non-root userid and groupidMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc9090ab48b4699494b63b35cd6d7414c52d665ecae12add3cdc56c9b@%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-28129: DEB packaging for Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 installed with a non-root userid and groupid - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
