{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41132", "Description": "OMERO.web provides a web based client and plugin infrastructure. In versions prior to 5.11.0, a variety of templates do not perform proper sanitization through HTML escaping. Due to the lack of sanitization and use of ``jQuery.html()``, there are a whole host of cross-site scripting possibilities with specially crafted input to a variety of fields. This issue is patched in version 5.11.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41132", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOpenmicroscopy\u00bbOmero-figureVersions  before (<) 4.4.1cpe:2.3:a:openmicroscopy:omero-figure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenmicroscopy\u00bbOmero-webVersions  before (<) 5.11.0cpe:2.3:a:openmicroscopy:omero-web:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.78%  0.93%  -0.86 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.93%  1.78%  +0.86 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.08%  0.93%  +0.85 \n 4  2024-06-29  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-05-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-04-24  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-05-07  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ome/omero-web/commit/0168067accde5e635341b3c714b1d53ae92ba424", "ref_desc": "Fix issues with inconsistency in input sanitisation leading to XSS ve\u2026 \u00b7 ome/omero-web@0168067 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openmicroscopy.org/security/advisories/2021-SV3/", "ref_desc": "2021-SV3 XSS vectors | Open Microscopy Environment (OME)Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ome/omero-web/security/advisories/GHSA-g67g-hvc3-xmvf", "ref_desc": "Inconsistent input sanitization leads to XSS vectors \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ome/omero-web \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
