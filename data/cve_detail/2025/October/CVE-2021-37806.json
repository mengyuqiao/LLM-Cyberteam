{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37806", "Description": "An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in https://phpgurukul.com Vehicle Parking Management System affected version 1.0. The system is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection on multiple endpoints. Based on the SLEEP(N) function payload that will sleep for a number of seconds used on the (1) editid , (2) viewid, and (3) catename parameters, the server response is about (N) seconds delay respectively which mean it is vulnerable to MySQL Blind (Time Based). An attacker can use sqlmap to further the exploitation for extracting sensitive information from the database.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37806", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nPhpgurukul\u00bbVehicle Parking Management System\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:phpgurukul:vehicle_parking_management_system:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-22  0.38%  0.40%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.79%  0.38%  -0.41 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.38%  0.79%  +0.41 \n 4  2025-03-17  1.14%  0.38%  -0.77 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.94%  1.14%  +0.20 \n 6  2024-09-18  0.96%  0.94%  -0.02 \n 7  2024-07-12  0.95%  0.96%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-06-02  0.77%  0.95%  +0.18 \n 9  2023-11-23  0.55%  0.77%  +0.23 \n 10  2023-10-12  0.38%  0.55%  +0.16 \n 11  2023-05-20  0.36%  0.38%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-04-09  0.36%  0.36%  +0.00 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.36%  -0.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://streamable.com/rfcchi", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-37806Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-mitre/tree/main/CVE-2021-37806", "ref_desc": "CVE-mitre/CVE-2021-37806 at main \u00b7 nu11secur1ty/CVE-mitre \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163626/Vehicle-Parking-Management-System-1.0-SQL-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Vehicle Parking Management System 1.0 SQL Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
