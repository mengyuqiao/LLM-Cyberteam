{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25633", "Description": "LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document to combine multiple certificate data, which when opened caused LibreOffice to display a validly signed indicator but whose content was unrelated to the signature shown. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25633", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLibreoffice\u00bbLibreofficeVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.6cpe:2.3:a:libreoffice:libreoffice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLibreoffice\u00bbLibreofficeVersions  from including (>=) 7.1.0andbefore (<) 7.1.2cpe:2.3:a:libreoffice:libreoffice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-17  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-05-14  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.57%  0.24%  -0.33 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.24%  0.57%  +0.33 \n 5  2025-03-20  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.15%  0.00 \n 8  2024-08-19  0.11%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 9  2024-06-26  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-04  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-03-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4988", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4988-1 libreofficeThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3DmA5OYoYq6Re-OWEDc_GjrSRpw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/CVE-2021-25633", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-25633 | LibreOffice - Free Office Suite - Based on OpenOffice - Compatible with MicrosoftVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
