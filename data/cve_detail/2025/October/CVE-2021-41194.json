{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41194", "Description": "FirstUseAuthenticator is a JupyterHub authenticator that helps new users set their password on their first login to JupyterHub. When JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.0 allows unauthorized access to any user's account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed. One may upgrade to version 1.0.0 or apply a patch manually to mitigate the vulnerability. For those who cannot upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator 1.0.0. If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until a patch or upgrade occurs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41194", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nJupyterhub\u00bbFirst Use AuthenticatorVersions  before (<) 1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:jupyterhub:first_use_authenticator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-23  0.33%  0.35%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.65%  0.33%  -0.32 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.33%  0.65%  +0.32 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.30%  +0.08 \n 6  2024-07-13  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-06-03  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-05-08  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-06-19  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-06-05  0.18%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-05-21  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 12  2023-04-10  0.15%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-5xvc-vgmp-jgc3", "ref_desc": "Improper Access Control in jupyterhub-firstuseauthenticator \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38.patch", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38", "ref_desc": "normalize username to lock password by georgejhunt \u00b7 Pull Request #38 \u00b7 jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
