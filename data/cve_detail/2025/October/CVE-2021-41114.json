{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41114", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to host spoofing due to improper validation of the HTTP Host header. TYPO3 uses the HTTP Host header, for example, to generate absolute URLs during the frontend rendering process. Since the host header itself is provided by the client, it can be forged to any value, even in a name-based virtual hosts environment. This vulnerability is the same as described in TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-001 (CVE-2014-3941). A regression, introduced during TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation. The already existing setting $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['trustedHostsPattern'] (used as an effective mitigation strategy in previous TYPO3 versions) was not evaluated anymore, and reintroduced the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41114", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.5.0cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.44%  0.29%  -0.16 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.29%  0.44%  +0.16 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.29%  +0.20 \n 4  2024-06-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-04-15  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-04-28  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-18  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-644 Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/644/Improper-Neutralization-of-HTTP-Headers-for-Scripting-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-015", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-015: HTTP Host Header Injection in Request HandlingVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/5cbff85506cebe343e5ae59228977547cf8e3cf4", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Verify HTTP_HOST via FE/BE middleware \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3@5cbff85 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-m2jh-fxw4-gphm", "ref_desc": "HTTP Host Header Injection in Request Handling \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
