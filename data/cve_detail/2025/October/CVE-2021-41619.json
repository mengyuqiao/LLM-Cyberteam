{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41619", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Gradle Enterprise before 2021.1.2. There is potential remote code execution via the application startup configuration. The installation configuration user interface (available to administrators) allows specifying arbitrary Java Virtual Machine startup options. Some of these options, such as -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError, allow specifying a command to be run on the host. This can be abused to run arbitrary commands on the host, should an attacker gain administrative access to the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41619", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGradle\u00bbEnterpriseVersions  from including (>=) 2020.4andbefore (<) 2021.1.2cpe:2.3:a:gradle:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  6.04%  2.28%  -3.76 \n 2  2025-03-29  2.28%  6.04%  +3.76 \n 3  2025-03-20  1.31%  2.28%  +0.97 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.47%  1.31%  +0.84 \n 5  2024-12-28  0.33%  0.47%  +0.14 \n 6  2024-01-19  0.27%  0.33%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-10-12  0.26%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-06-04  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-05-20  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.22%  -1.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gradle.com/advisory/2021-08", "ref_desc": "Gradle Enterprise - Security Advisories | Gradle Inc.Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gradle.com", "ref_desc": "Gradle Enterprise - Security Advisories | Gradle Inc.Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Nx3JUPFsABnDrVfU9wxisWcE-vk.html"}]}
