{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39223", "Description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud Richdocuments application prior to versions 3.8.6 and 4.2.3 returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. (e.g. an attacker could see that the file `shared.txt` is located within `/files/$username/Myfolder/Mysubfolder/shared.txt`). It is recommended that the Richdocuments application is upgraded to 3.8.6 or 4.2.3. As a workaround, disable the Richdocuments application in the app settings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39223", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbRichdocumentsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:richdocuments:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbRichdocumentsVersions  before (<) 3.8.6cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:richdocuments:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-20  0.33%  0.35%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.65%  0.33%  -0.31 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.33%  0.65%  +0.31 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.33%  +0.21 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-07-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-05-31  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-05-05  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-05-18  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-04-07  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1253460", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/richdocuments/pull/1760", "ref_desc": "Unify error messages accross controllers by juliushaertl \u00b7 Pull Request #1760 \u00b7 nextcloud/richdocuments \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-rjcc-4cgj-6v93", "ref_desc": "File path disclosure of shared files in Richdocuments application \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
