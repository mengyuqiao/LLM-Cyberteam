{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-42740", "Description": "The shell-quote package before 1.7.3 for Node.js allows command injection. An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to support Windows drive letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real shell as a quoted argument to a command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell metacharacters exist in the space between capital letter Z and lower case letter a, such as the backtick character.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42740", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShell-quote Project\u00bbShell-quote\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.7.3cpe:2.3:a:shell-quote_project:shell-quote:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  3.98%  7.57%  +3.59 \n 2  2025-06-02  6.80%  3.98%  -2.82 \n 3  2025-06-01  12.51%  6.80%  -5.71 \n 4  2025-05-07  16.09%  12.51%  -3.58 \n 5  2025-05-05  4.58%  16.09%  +11.51 \n 6  2025-05-01  7.54%  4.58%  -2.96 \n 7  2025-04-17  4.58%  7.54%  +2.96 \n 8  2025-04-16  7.54%  4.58%  -2.96 \n 9  2025-04-12  4.58%  7.54%  +2.96 \n 10  2025-04-11  7.54%  4.58%  -2.96 \n 11  2025-04-08  4.58%  7.54%  +2.96 \n 12  2025-04-07  7.54%  4.58%  -2.96 \n 13  2025-03-31  4.58%  7.54%  +2.96 \n 14  2025-03-30  11.28%  4.58%  -6.70 \n 15  2025-03-29  7.54%  11.28%  +3.74 \n 16  2025-03-27  4.58%  7.54%  +2.96 \n 17  2025-03-26  7.54%  4.58%  -2.96 \n 18  2025-03-17  0.66%  7.54%  +6.88 \n 19  2024-12-17  0.56%  0.66%  +0.10 \n 20  2024-10-24  0.39%  0.56%  +0.16 \n 21  2024-09-12  0.28%  0.39%  +0.12 \n 22  2024-07-06  0.17%  0.28%  +0.11 \n 23  2024-05-27  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 24  2024-05-01  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 25  2023-06-12  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 26  2023-05-29  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 27  2023-05-14  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 28  2023-04-03  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 29  2023-03-07  2.21%  0.12%  -2.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/substack/node-shell-quote/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#173", "ref_desc": "node-shell-quote/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 substack/node-shell-quote \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/shell-quote", "ref_desc": "shell-quote - npmVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/substack/node-shell-quote/commit/5799416ed454aa4ec9afafc895b4e31760ea1abe", "ref_desc": "fix for security issue with windows drive letter regex \u00b7 substack/node-shell-quote@5799416 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
