{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41089", "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy files using `docker cp` into a specially-crafted container can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host\u2019s filesystem, widening access to others. This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers do not need to be restarted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41089", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMobyproject\u00bbMobyVersions  before (<) 20.10.9cpe:2.3:a:mobyproject:moby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.03%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.05%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-222547.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7GlGCtCzjVoInXg7nQDvLXlS-q4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/bce32e5c93be4caf1a592582155b9cb837fc129a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #4 from moby/20.10-ghsa-v994-f8vw-g7j4-chroot-mkdir \u00b7 moby/moby@bce32e5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/B5Q6G6I4W5COQE25QMC7FJY3I3PAYFBB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: moby-engine-20.10.9-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JIiexwMqlVpv1TtzlUT-V46lWNc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-v994-f8vw-g7j4", "ref_desc": "`docker cp` allows unexpected chmod of host files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 moby/moby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZNFADTCHHYWVM6W4NJ6CB4FNFM2VMBIB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: moby-engine-20.10.9-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XTh_y5K6IBBjck_7IDSDAo5zYyQ.html"}]}
