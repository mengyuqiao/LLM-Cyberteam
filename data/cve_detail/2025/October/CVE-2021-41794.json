{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41794", "Description": "ogs_fqdn_parse in Open5GS 1.0.0 through 2.3.3 inappropriately trusts a client-supplied length value, leading to a buffer overflow. The attacker can send a PFCP Session Establishment Request with \"internet\" as the PDI Network Instance. The first character is interpreted as a length value to be used in a memcpy call. The destination buffer is only 100 bytes long on the stack. Then, 'i' gets interpreted as 105 bytes to copy from the source buffer to the destination buffer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41794", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nOpen5gs\u00bbOpen5gsVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.3.3cpe:2.3:a:open5gs:open5gs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-03  0.39%  0.40%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-02  0.37%  0.39%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.47%  0.37%  -0.10 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.37%  0.47%  +0.10 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.08%  0.37%  +0.29 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 7  2024-06-22  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-05-13  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-04-30  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 10  2023-03-20  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/10/06/technical-advisory-open5gs-stack-buffer-overflow-during-pfcp-session-establishment-on-upf-cve-2021-41794", "ref_desc": "Technical Advisory \u2013 Open5GS Stack Buffer Overflow During PFCP Session Establishment on UPF (CVE-2021-41794) \u2013 NCC Group ResearchExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
