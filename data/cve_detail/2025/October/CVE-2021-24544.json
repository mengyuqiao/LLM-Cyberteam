{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24544", "Description": "The Responsive WordPress Slider WordPress plugin through 2.2.0 does not sanitise and escape some of the Slider options, allowing Cross-Site Scripting payloads to be set in them. Furthermore, as by default any authenticated user is allowed to create Sliders (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/slider-can-be-changed-from-any-user-even-subscriber/, such settings can be changed in the plugin's settings), this would allow user with a role as low as subscriber to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in admins viewing the slider list and could lead to privilege escalation by creating a rogue admin account for example.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24544", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMotopress\u00bbMotopress-slider-lite\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.0cpe:2.3:a:motopress:motopress-slider-lite:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-20  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  4.07%  0.22%  -3.85 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.22%  4.07%  +3.85 \n 4  2025-03-24  1.46%  0.22%  -1.24 \n 5  2025-03-23  0.22%  1.46%  +1.24 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.22%  +0.17 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 8  2023-05-18  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/4a2dddfc-6ce2-4edd-aaaa-4c130a9356d0", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
