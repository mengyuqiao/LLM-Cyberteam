{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41177", "Description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, Nextcloud Server did not implement a database backend for rate-limiting purposes. Any component of Nextcloud using rate-limits (as as `AnonRateThrottle` or `UserRateThrottle`) was thus not rate limited on instances not having a memory cache backend configured. In the case of a default installation, this would notably include the rate-limits on the two factor codes. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5, or 22.2.0. As a workaround, enable a memory cache backend in `config.php`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41177", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.0andbefore (<) 21.0.5cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 22.0.0andbefore (<) 22.2.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 20.0.13cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-20  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-04-03  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.48%  0.15%  -0.34 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.15%  0.48%  +0.34 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.15%  -0.27 \n 7  2024-06-27  0.21%  0.42%  +0.21 \n 8  2023-06-16  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-06-02  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-18  0.13%  0.19%  +0.06 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-799 Improper Control of Interaction Frequency", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/799/Improper-Control-of-Interaction-Frequency.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1265709", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-17) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jZHo9JiHBzcYnpiDroWdMBiDUSQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28728", "ref_desc": "Add database ratelimiting backend by LukasReschke \u00b7 Pull Request #28728 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-fj39-4qx4-m3f2", "ref_desc": "Rate-limits not working on instances without configured memory cache backend \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
