{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40498", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SAP SuccessFactors Mobile Application for Android - versions older than 2108, which allows an attacker to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service, either by crashing or flooding the service, which can lead to denial of service. The vulnerability is related to Android implementation methods that are widely used across Android mobile applications, and such methods are embedded into the SAP SuccessFactors mobile application. These Android methods begin executing once the user accesses their profile on the mobile application. While executing, it can also pick up the activities from other Android applications that are running in the background of the users device and are using the same types of methods in the application. Such vulnerability can also lead to phishing attacks that can be used for staging other types of attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40498", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbSuccessfactors Mobile\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 2108cpe:2.3:a:sap:successfactors_mobile:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-05  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=587169983", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Patch Day \u2013 October 2021 - Product Security Response at SAP - Community WikiVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_eHPczkuXXwsue5ASdLgeXzfvEs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3077635", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
