{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41156", "Description": "anuko/timetracker is an, open source time tracking system. In affected versions Time Tracker uses browser_today hidden control on a few pages to collect the today's date from user browsers. Because of not checking this parameter for sanity in versions prior to 1.19.30.5601, it was possible to craft an html form with malicious JavaScript, use social engineering to convince logged on users to execute a POST from such form, and have the attacker-supplied JavaScript to be executed in user's browser. This has been patched in version 1.19.30.5600. Upgrade is recommended. If it is not practical, introduce ttValidDbDateFormatDate function as in the latest version and add a call to it within the access checks block.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41156", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTimetracker Project\u00bbTimetrackerVersions  before (<) 1.19.30.5601cpe:2.3:a:timetracker_project:timetracker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-13  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.38%  0.27%  -0.12 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.27%  0.38%  +0.12 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.27%  +0.22 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 6  2023-05-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-g9cc-m4p4-6xpc", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anuko/timetracker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
