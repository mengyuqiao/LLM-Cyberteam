{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41138", "Description": "Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. In the newly introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for `pallet-ethereum`, a large part of transaction validation logic was only called in transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious validators can take advantage of this to put invalid transactions into a block. The attack is limited in that the signature is always validated, and the majority of the validation is done again in the subsequent `pallet-evm` execution logic. However, do note that a chain ID replay attack was possible. In addition, spamming attacks are of main concerns, while they are limited by Substrate block size limits and other factors. The issue is patched in commit `146bb48849e5393004be5c88beefe76fdf009aba`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41138", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nParity\u00bbFrontierVersions  from including (>=) 2021-09-30andbefore (<) 2021-10-13cpe:2.3:a:parity:frontier:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-08  0.55%  0.58%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.70%  0.55%  -0.15 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.55%  0.70%  +0.15 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.14%  0.55%  +0.40 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-09-18  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-06-28  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-05-19  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 9  2024-04-10  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-06-04  0.08%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-03-26  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.07%  -2.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/commit/146bb48849e5393004be5c88beefe76fdf009aba", "ref_desc": "Fix security issue: transaction validity controls must be executed in\u2026 \u00b7 paritytech/frontier@146bb48 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/497", "ref_desc": "Ensure no error is possible in `apply_validated_transaction` and fix `correct_and_deposit_fee` by sorpaas \u00b7 Pull Request #497 \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/security/advisories/GHSA-vj62-g63v-f8mf", "ref_desc": "Validity check for signed Frontier-specific extrinsic not called in block execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
