{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34706", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34706", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection;Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services EngineVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:3.1(0.518)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:3.1\\(0.518\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:3.2(0.149)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:3.2\\(0.149\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.28%  0.21%  -0.08 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.21%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.20%  +0.13 \n 5  2023-04-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xxe-inj-V4VSjEsX", "ref_desc": "Cisco Identity Services Engine XML External Entity Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
