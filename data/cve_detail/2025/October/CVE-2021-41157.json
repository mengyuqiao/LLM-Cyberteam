{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41157", "Description": "FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41157", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFreeswitch\u00bbFreeswitchVersions  before (<) 1.10.6cpe:2.3:a:freeswitch:freeswitch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-21  0.28%  0.26%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.33%  0.28%  -0.05 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.28%  0.33%  +0.05 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.15%  0.28%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-07-11  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-18  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-04-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/commit/b21dd4e7f3a6f1d5f7be3ea500a319a5bc11db9e", "ref_desc": "[Default-Configuration] Force sip subscription requests to require au\u2026 \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch@b21dd4e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xg-7c54-rmpj", "ref_desc": "FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP SUBSCRIBE requests by default \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/41", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [ES2021-08] FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP SUBSCRIBE requests by defaultMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/releases/tag/v1.10.6", "ref_desc": "Release FreeSWITCH v1.10.6 Release \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QyNpaOIg0Vs9XfChvV7S9TtjXlc.html"}]}
