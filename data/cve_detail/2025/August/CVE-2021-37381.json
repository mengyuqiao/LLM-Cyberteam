{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37381", "Description": "Southsoft GMIS 5.0 is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Attackers can access other users' private information such as photos through CSRF. For example: any student's photo information can be accessed through /gmis/(S([1]))/student/grgl/PotoImageShow/?bh=[2]. Among them, the code in [1] is a random string generated according to the user's login related information. It can protect the user's identity, but it can not effectively prevent unauthorized access. The code in [2] is the student number of any student. The attacker can carry out CSRF attack on the system by modifying [2] without modifying [1].", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37381", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nSouthsoft\u00bbGraduate Management Information System\u00bbVersion:5.0cpe:2.3:a:southsoft:graduate_management_information_system:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-29  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.17%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 4  2025-03-20  0.17%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.19%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-12-09  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 8  2024-04-21  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 9  2024-03-12  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/caiteli/poc_information/blob/main/southsoft_GMIS.txt", "ref_desc": "poc_information/southsoft_GMIS.txt at main \u00b7 caiteli/poc_information \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/caiteli/poc_information/issues/1", "ref_desc": "letter of thanks \u00b7 Issue #1 \u00b7 caiteli/poc_information \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
