{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37712", "Description": "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37712", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOracle\u00bbGraalvm\u00bbVersion:20.3.3    EnterpriseEditioncpe:2.3:a:oracle:graalvm:20.3.3:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nOracle\u00bbGraalvm\u00bbVersion:21.2.0    EnterpriseEditioncpe:2.3:a:oracle:graalvm:21.2.0:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nSiemens\u00bbSinec Infrastructure Network ServicesVersions  before (<) 1.0.1.1cpe:2.3:a:siemens:sinec_infrastructure_network_services:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNpmjs\u00bbTAR\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 6.1.8cpe:2.3:a:npmjs:tar:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nNpmjs\u00bbTAR\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.4.17cpe:2.3:a:npmjs:tar:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nNpmjs\u00bbTAR\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.0.9cpe:2.3:a:npmjs:tar:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-07  0.03%  0.02%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.15%  0.03%  -0.12 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.15%  +0.12 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.16%  0.03%  -0.13 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-05-16  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-04-06  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-24  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.72%  0.11%  -1.61 \n 10  2023-02-23  3.64%  1.72%  -1.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar", "ref_desc": "tar - npmProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/C0J2CxjZJf8ph9ZCcfZgnA2tFsg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite via insufficient symlink protection due to directory cache poisoning using symbolic links \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 npm/node-tar \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00023.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3237-1] node-tar security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JMeJuVsg0lk7L_NIAgBJRJ6trT0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RWUpGy9G_gyGrISbxe-OvGRBVAM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5008", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5008-1 node-tarThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Wq44ntdI4sxfFSb8wscsaCSO6Dg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WZWxfkA5Nfx_T-RjFs6OqiqIM9U.html"}]}
