{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37698", "Description": "Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for reporting. In versions 2.5.0 through 2.13.0, ElasticsearchWriter, GelfWriter, InfluxdbWriter and Influxdb2Writer do not verify the server's certificate despite a certificate authority being specified. Icinga 2 instances which connect to any of the mentioned time series databases (TSDBs) using TLS over a spoofable infrastructure should immediately upgrade to version 2.13.1, 2.12.6, or 2.11.11 to patch the issue. Such instances should also change the credentials (if any) used by the TSDB writer feature to authenticate against the TSDB. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37698", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 2.13.0andbefore (<) 2.13.1cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 2.12.0andbefore (<) 2.12.6cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.11.10cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-06  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-04-14  0.14%  0.11%  -0.03 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.45%  0.14%  -0.31 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.14%  0.45%  +0.31 \n 5  2025-03-20  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.27%  0.13%  -0.14 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.27%  -0.06 \n 8  2024-09-05  0.23%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 9  2024-05-04  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 10  2024-03-25  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 11  2024-02-28  0.20%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-12  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 13  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.17%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/releases/tag/v2.12.6", "ref_desc": "Release Icinga v2.12.6 \u00b7 Icinga/icinga2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/releases/tag/v2.11.11", "ref_desc": "Release Icinga v2.11.11 \u00b7 Icinga/icinga2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/releases/tag/v2.13.1", "ref_desc": "Release Icinga v2.13.1 \u00b7 Icinga/icinga2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/11/msg00010.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2816-1] icinga2 security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lKImfY1caokQKVljww_4rbTB-Hk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/security/advisories/GHSA-cxfm-8j5v-5qr2", "ref_desc": "Missing TLS server certificate validation in ElasticsearchWriter, GelfWriter, InfluxdbWriter and Influxdb2Writer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Icinga/icinga2 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
