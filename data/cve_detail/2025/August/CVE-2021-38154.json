{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-38154", "Description": "Certain Canon devices manufactured in 2012 through 2020 (such as imageRUNNER ADVANCE iR-ADV C5250), when Catwalk Server is enabled for HTTP access, allow remote attackers to modify an e-mail address setting, and thus cause the device to send sensitive information through e-mail to the attacker. For example, an incoming FAX may be sent through e-mail to the attacker. This occurs when a PIN is not required for General User Mode, as exploited in the wild in August 2021.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38154", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCanon\u00bb-cpe:2.3:h:canon:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.70% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.13%  0.70%  -0.43 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.70%  1.13%  +0.43 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.49%  0.70%  +0.21 \n 4  2025-01-01  0.40%  0.49%  +0.08 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.72%  0.40%  -0.32 \n 6  2024-09-01  0.70%  0.72%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-06-09  0.63%  0.70%  +0.07 \n 8  2024-05-14  0.57%  0.63%  +0.06 \n 9  2024-04-04  0.46%  0.57%  +0.11 \n 10  2023-11-21  0.34%  0.46%  +0.12 \n 11  2023-08-14  0.33%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-04-06  0.23%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 13  2023-03-22  0.21%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 14  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.21%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/product-advisories", "ref_desc": "Canon U.S.A., Inc. | Product AdvisoriesProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://protocolpolice.nl/CVE-2021-38154_Protocol_Police_Catwalk_Alert", "ref_desc": "403 ForbiddenExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
