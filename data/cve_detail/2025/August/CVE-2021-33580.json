{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33580", "Description": "User controlled `request.getHeader(\"Referer\")`, `request.getRequestURL()` and `request.getQueryString()` are used to build and run a regex expression. The attacker doesn't have to use a browser and may send a specially crafted Referer header programmatically. Since the attacker controls the string and the regex pattern he may cause a ReDoS by regex catastrophic backtracking on the server side. This problem has been fixed in Roller 6.0.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33580", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbRollerVersions  before (<) 6.0.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:roller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  5.05%  4.14%  -0.91 \n 2  2025-03-29  4.14%  5.05%  +0.91 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  4.14%  +4.05 \n 4  2025-01-05  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-07-10  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 7  2024-05-03  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-03-24  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 9  2024-01-18  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 10  2023-08-15  0.15%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 11  2023-08-03  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-07-05  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 13  2023-03-11  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 14  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/18/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-33580: Apache Roller: regex injection leading to DoSMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r9d967d80af941717573e531db2c7353a90bfd0886e9b5d5d79f75506%40%3Cuser.roller.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-33580: Apache Roller: regex injection leading to DoS - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
