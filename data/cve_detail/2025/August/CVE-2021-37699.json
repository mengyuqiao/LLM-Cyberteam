{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37699", "Description": "Next.js is an open source website development framework to be used with the React library. In affected versions specially encoded paths could be used when pages/_error.js was statically generated allowing an open redirect to occur to an external site. In general, this redirect does not directly harm users although can allow for phishing attacks by redirecting to an attacker's domain from a trusted domain. We recommend everyone to upgrade regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not.
