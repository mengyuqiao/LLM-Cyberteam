{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32812", "Description": "Monkshu is an enterprise application server for mobile apps (iOS and Android), responsive HTML 5 apps, and JSON API services. In version 2.90 and earlier, there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in frontend HTTP server. The attacker can send in a carefully crafted URL along with a known bug in the server which will cause a 500 error, and the response will then embed the URL provided by the hacker. The impact is moderate as the hacker must also be able to craft an HTTP request which should cause a 500 server error. None such requests are known as this point. The issue is patched in version 2.95. As a workaround, one may use a disk caching plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32812", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTekmonks\u00bbMonkshu\u00bbVersion:2.90cpe:2.3:a:tekmonks:monkshu:2.90:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.24%  0.28%  +0.04 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.28%  0.24%  -0.04 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.28%  +0.17 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-04-17  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-03-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 7  2024-02-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TekMonksGitHub/monkshu/security/advisories/GHSA-hcpx-66hq-7g4x", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') and Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output in frontend/server/server.js \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TekMonksGitHub/monkshu \u00b7 GitHThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TekMonksGitHub/monkshu/releases/tag/v2.95", "ref_desc": "Release Release 2.95 \u00b7 TekMonksGitHub/monkshu \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TekMonksGitHub/monkshu/commit/4601a9bfdc934d7ac32619ce621652fad0cf452b", "ref_desc": "Fix for GHSA-hcpx-66hq-7g4x.
