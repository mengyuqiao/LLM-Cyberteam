{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37705", "Description": "OneFuzz is an open source self-hosted Fuzzing-As-A-Service platform. Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance. To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release 2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration, which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37705", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbOnefuzzVersions  from including (>=) 2.12.0andbefore (<) 2.31.0cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:onefuzz:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.73% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.48%  0.73%  +0.26 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.73%  0.48%  -0.26 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.71%  0.73%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.71%  0.71%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-08-01  0.68%  0.71%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-04-28  0.57%  0.68%  +0.11 \n 7  2024-04-15  0.59%  0.57%  -0.02 \n 8  2024-03-19  0.81%  0.59%  -0.22 \n 9  2024-02-22  0.69%  0.81%  +0.12 \n 10  2023-06-02  0.48%  0.69%  +0.20 \n 11  2023-05-03  0.44%  0.48%  +0.05 \n 12  2023-04-04  0.30%  0.44%  +0.14 \n 13  2023-03-21  0.26%  0.30%  +0.04 \n 14  2023-03-07  12.70%  0.26%  -12.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/onefuzz/", "ref_desc": "onefuzz \u00b7 PyPIProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/security/advisories/GHSA-q5vh-6whw-x745", "ref_desc": "Incomplete authorization in multi-tenant deployments \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 microsoft/onefuzz \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/commit/2fcb4998887959b4fa11894a068d689189742cb1", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-q5vh-6whw-x745 \u00b7 microsoft/onefuzz@2fcb499 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/1153", "ref_desc": "Fixed an issue with incomplete authorization in multi-tenant deployments by bmc-msft \u00b7 Pull Request #1153 \u00b7 microsoft/onefuzz \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/releases/tag/2.31.0", "ref_desc": "Release 2.31.0 \u00b7 microsoft/onefuzz \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
