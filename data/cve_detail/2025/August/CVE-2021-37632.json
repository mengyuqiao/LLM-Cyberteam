{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37632", "Description": "SuperMartijn642's Config Lib is a library used by a number of mods for the game Minecraft. The versions of SuperMartijn642's Config Lib between 1.0.4 and 1.0.8 are affected by a vulnerability and can be exploited on both servers and clients. Using SuperMartijn642's Config Lib, servers will send a packet to clients with the server's config values. In order to read `enum` values from the packet data, `ObjectInputStream#readObject` is used. `ObjectInputStream#readObject` will instantiate a class based on the input data. Since, the packet data is not validated before `ObjectInputStream#readObject` is called, an attacker can instantiate any class by sending a malicious packet. If a suitable class is found, the vulnerability can lead to a number of exploits, including remote code execution. Although the vulnerable packet is typically only send from server to client, it can theoretically also be send from client to server. This means both clients and servers running SuperMartijn642's Config Lib between 1.0.4 and 1.0.8 are vulnerable. The vulnerability has been patched in SuperMartijn642's Config lib 1.0.9. Both, players and server owners, should update to 1.0.9 or higher.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37632", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nConfig Lib Project\u00bbConfig LibVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.4andbefore (<) 1.0.9cpe:2.3:a:config_lib_project:config_lib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.86% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  5.81%  1.86%  -3.95 \n 2  2025-03-29  1.86%  5.81%  +3.95 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.61%  1.86%  +1.25 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.64%  0.61%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-07-11  0.61%  0.64%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-04-20  0.57%  0.61%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-03-11  0.55%  0.57%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-01-18  0.53%  0.55%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-10-28  0.51%  0.53%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-07-21  0.49%  0.51%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.49%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/SuperMartijn642/SuperMartijn642sConfigLib/security/advisories/GHSA-f4r5-w453-2jx6", "ref_desc": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data in com.supermartijn642.configlib.ConfigSyncPacket \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 SuperMartijn642/SuperMartijn642sConfigLib \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
