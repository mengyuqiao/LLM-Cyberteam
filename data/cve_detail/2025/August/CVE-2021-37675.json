{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37675", "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions most implementations of convolution operators in TensorFlow are affected by a division by 0 vulnerability where an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a crash. The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/framework/common_shape_fns.cc#L577) is missing several validations before doing divisions and modulo operations. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 8a793b5d7f59e37ac7f3cd0954a750a2fe76bad4. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37675", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.5.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.6.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.6.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.6.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.03%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.03%  0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-369 Divide By Zero", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/369/Divide-By-Zero.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8a793b5d7f59e37ac7f3cd0954a750a2fe76bad4", "ref_desc": "Prevent division by 0 in common shape functions. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@8a793b5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9c8h-2mv3-49ww", "ref_desc": "Division by 0 in most convolution operators \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
