{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-38155", "Description": "OpenStack Keystone 10.x through 16.x before 16.0.2, 17.x before 17.0.1, 18.x before 18.0.1, and 19.x before 19.0.1 allows information disclosure during account locking (related to PCI DSS features). By guessing the name of an account and failing to authenticate multiple times, any unauthenticated actor could both confirm the account exists and obtain that account's corresponding UUID, which might be leveraged for other unrelated attacks. All deployments enabling security_compliance.lockout_failure_attempts are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38155", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nOpenstack\u00bbKeystoneVersions  from including (>=) 18.0.0andbefore (<) 18.0.1cpe:2.3:a:openstack:keystone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbKeystoneVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 16.0.2cpe:2.3:a:openstack:keystone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbKeystoneVersions  from including (>=) 17.0.0andbefore (<) 17.0.1cpe:2.3:a:openstack:keystone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbKeystoneVersions  from including (>=) 19.0.0andbefore (<) 19.0.1cpe:2.3:a:openstack:keystone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-19  0.86%  0.79%  -0.07 \n 2  2025-05-15  0.79%  0.86%  +0.07 \n 3  2025-03-30  26.80%  0.79%  -26.01 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.79%  26.80%  +26.01 \n 5  2025-03-24  10.03%  0.79%  -9.24 \n 6  2025-03-23  0.79%  10.03%  +9.24 \n 7  2025-03-17  0.20%  0.79%  +0.59 \n 8  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 9  2024-12-09  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 10  2024-04-21  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 11  2024-03-12  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 12  2024-01-24  0.14%  0.11%  -0.03 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2021-003.html", "ref_desc": "OSSA-2021-003: Account name and UUID oracles in account locking \u2014 OpenStack Security Advisories 0.0.1.dev239 documentationPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/10/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [OSSA-2021-003] Keystone: Account name and UUID oracles in account locking (CVE-2021-38155)Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00007.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3714-1] keystone security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fZUoxdqQUCLQ0eCOjPMZJhVNQt8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1688137", "ref_desc": "Bug #1688137 \u201cAccount name and UUID oracles in account locking (...\u201d : Bugs : OpenStack Identity (keystone)Exploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
