{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32797", "Description": "JupyterLab is a user interface for Project Jupyter which will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook. In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on load. In particular JupyterLab doesn\u2019t sanitize the action attribute of html `<form>`. Using this it is possible to trigger the form validation outside of the form itself. This is a remote code execution, but requires user action to open a notebook.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32797", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbJupyterlabVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.2cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyterlab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJupyter\u00bbJupyterlabVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.10cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyterlab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJupyter\u00bbJupyterlabVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.0andbefore (<) 3.1.4cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyterlab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJupyter\u00bbJupyterlabVersions  before (<) 1.2.21cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyterlab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJupyter\u00bbJupyterlabVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.17cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyterlab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  2.17%  0.48%  -1.69 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.48%  2.17%  +1.69 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.51%  0.48%  -0.03 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.52%  0.51%  0.00 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.45%  0.52%  +0.06 \n 6  2024-12-12  0.37%  0.45%  +0.08 \n 7  2024-07-15  0.35%  0.37%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-04-24  0.39%  0.35%  -0.03 \n 9  2024-03-15  0.39%  0.39%  0.00 \n 10  2024-01-22  0.37%  0.39%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-07-25  0.36%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.69%  0.36%  -1.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/security/advisories/GHSA-4952-p58q-6crx", "ref_desc": "JupyterLab: XSS due to lack of sanitization of the action attribute of an HTML form \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterlab/jupyterlab \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/commit/504825938c0abfa2fb8ff8d529308830a5ae42ed", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-4952-p58q-6crx \u00b7 jupyterlab/jupyterlab@5048259 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
