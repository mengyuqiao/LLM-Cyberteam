{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32778", "Description": "Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions envoy\u2019s procedure for resetting a HTTP/2 stream has O(N^2) complexity, leading to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. Deployments are susceptible to Denial of Service when Envoy is configured with high limit on H/2 concurrent streams. An attacker wishing to exploit this vulnerability would require a client opening and closing a large number of H/2 streams. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to reduce time complexity of resetting HTTP/2 streams. As a workaround users may limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 dreams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 100.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32778", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.17.0andbefore (<) 1.17.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.16.0andbefore (<) 1.16.5cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.18.0andbefore (<) 1.18.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoy\u00bbVersion:1.19.0cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:1.19.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.24%  0.07%  -0.17 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.24%  +0.17 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-05-09  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-03-30  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-17  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-834 Excessive Iteration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/834/Excessive-Iteration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.19.0/version_history/version_history", "ref_desc": "Version history \u2014 envoy tag-v1.19.0 documentationRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6ElgLISX3BA0RkKLLl01YJu8KPE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-3xh3-33v5-chcc", "ref_desc": "Excessive CPU utilization when closing HTTP/2 streams \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AdQpkB1zN4AUgaiYIQ-yMQk-nOY.html"}]}
