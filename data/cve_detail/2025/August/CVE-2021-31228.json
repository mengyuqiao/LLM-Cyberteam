{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-31228", "Description": "An issue was discovered in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. This vulnerability allows the attacker to predict a DNS query's source port in order to send forged DNS response packets that will be accepted as valid answers to the DNS client's requests (without sniffing the specific request). Data is predictable because it is based on the time of day, and has too few bits.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31228", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHcc-embedded\u00bbNichestackVersions  before (<) 4.3cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:nichestack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.20%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.28%  0.20%  -0.08 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.28%  +0.22 \n 4  2024-05-04  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-operational-technology-vulnerabilities-found-on-nichestack/", "ref_desc": "New Critical Operational Technology Vulnerabilities Found on NicheStack \u2013 Mitigation Advised - ForescoutMitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/l5uwnaCYRQud8WLr0TbcpZCwhfg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/608209", "ref_desc": "VU#608209 - NicheStack embedded TCP/IP has vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o7Oo5HR02rJwxvQI3KfwFDiR7PU.html"}]}
