{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34715", "Description": "A vulnerability in the image verification function of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute code with internal user privileges on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the content of upgrade packages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious archive to the Upgrade page of the administrative web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code with user-level privileges (the _nobody account) on the underlying operating system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34715", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Video Communication ServerVersions  up to, including, (<=) x8.8cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_video_communication_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbExpresswayVersions  up to, including, (<=) x8.8.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:expressway:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.67% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.37%  0.67%  -0.70 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.67%  1.37%  +0.70 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.33%  0.67%  +0.34 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.23%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 5  2023-11-10  0.16%  0.23%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-08-03  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-26  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-11  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.13%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewver-c6WZPXRx", "ref_desc": "Cisco Expressway Series and TelePresence Video Communication Server Image Verification VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
