{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-38305", "Description": "23andMe Yamale before 3.0.8 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted schema file. The schema parser uses eval as part of its processing, and tries to protect from malicious expressions by limiting the builtins that are passed to the eval. When processing the schema, each line is run through Python's eval function to make the validator available. A well-constructed string within the schema rules can execute system commands; thus, by exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can run arbitrary code on the image that invokes Yamale.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38305", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\n23andme\u00bbYamaleVersions  before (<) 3.0.8cpe:2.3:a:23andme:yamale:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.59%  0.64%  +0.05 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.64%  0.59%  -0.05 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.52%  0.64%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.52%  +0.34 \n 5  2024-04-24  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-03-15  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-22  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-07-25  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.61%  0.16%  -1.45 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale/pull/165", "ref_desc": "Limit the strings which can be eval'd by mildebrandt \u00b7 Pull Request #165 \u00b7 23andMe/Yamale \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale/releases/tag/3.0.8", "ref_desc": "Release 3.0.8 \u00b7 23andMe/Yamale \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
