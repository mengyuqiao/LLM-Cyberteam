{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39173", "Description": "Cachet is an open source status page system. Prior to version 2.5.1 authenticated users, regardless of their privileges (User or Admin), can trick Cachet and install the instance again, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This issue was addressed in version 2.5.1 by improving the middleware `ReadyForUse`, which now performs a stricter validation of the instance name. As a workaround, only allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39173", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCatchethq\u00bbCatchetVersions  before (<) 2.5.1cpe:2.3:a:catchethq:catchet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.74% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  2.88%  0.74%  -2.14 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.74%  2.88%  +2.14 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.59%  0.74%  +0.16 \n 4  2025-03-17  1.27%  0.59%  -0.68 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.91%  1.27%  +0.36 \n 6  2024-09-29  0.64%  0.91%  +0.27 \n 7  2024-08-30  0.45%  0.64%  +0.19 \n 8  2024-08-15  0.50%  0.45%  -0.04 \n 9  2023-11-19  0.39%  0.50%  +0.11 \n 10  2023-06-16  0.27%  0.39%  +0.11 \n 11  2023-05-08  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 12  2023-04-18  0.21%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 13  2023-04-04  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 14  2023-03-20  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 15  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.18%  -2.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-704 Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/704/Incorrect-Type-Conversion-or-Cast.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/releases/tag/v2.5.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.5.1 \u00b7 fiveai/Cachet \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pvfSW2RADa1NrSkRo2nAAS7oOD8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/security/advisories/GHSA-r67m-m8c7-jp83", "ref_desc": "Forced reinstall \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fiveai/Cachet \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/", "ref_desc": "Cachet 2.4: Code Execution via Laravel Configuration InjectionExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vZ5Uc9LsoWwAYlhmSl7EBBgSn8Q.html"}]}
