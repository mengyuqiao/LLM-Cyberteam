The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of iFrame data in HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets with malicious iFrame data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a clickjacking attack where the user is tricked into clicking a malicious link.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37788", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGurock\u00bbTestrail\u00bbVersion:5.3.0.3603cpe:2.3:a:gurock:testrail:5.3.0.3603:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  7.27%  0.24%  -7.03 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.24%  7.27%  +7.03 \n 3  2025-03-24  2.90%  0.24%  -2.66 \n 4  2025-03-23  0.24%  2.90%  +2.66 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.53%  0.24%  -0.29 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.53%  +0.34 \n 7  2024-08-12  0.18%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-04-24  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1021 Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1021/Improper-Restriction-of-Rendered-UI-Layers-or-Frames.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/rvismit/67bc11dd9ccb7423827564cb81d25740", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-37788 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
