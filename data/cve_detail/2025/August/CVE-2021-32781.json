{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32781", "Description": "Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions after Envoy sends a locally generated response it must stop further processing of request or response data. However when local response is generated due the internal buffer overflow while request or response is processed by the filter chain the operation may not be stopped completely and result in accessing a freed memory block. A specifically constructed request delivered by an untrusted downstream or upstream peer in the presence of extensions that modify and increase the size of request or response bodies resulting in a Denial of Service when using extensions that modify and increase the size of request or response bodies, such as decompressor filter. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to address incomplete termination of request processing after locally generated response. As a workaround disable Envoy's decompressor, json-transcoder or grpc-web extensions or proprietary extensions that modify and increase the size of request or response bodies, if feasible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32781", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.17.0andbefore (<) 1.17.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.16.0andbefore (<) 1.16.5cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.18.0andbefore (<) 1.18.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoy\u00bbVersion:1.19.0cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:1.19.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.16%  0.08%  -0.09 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.08%  0.16%  +0.09 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.08%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-05-09  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-30  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-17  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-5vhv-gp9v-42qv", "ref_desc": "Continued processing of requests after locally generated response \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.19.0/version_history/version_history", "ref_desc": "Version history \u2014 envoy tag-v1.19.0 documentationVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6ElgLISX3BA0RkKLLl01YJu8KPE.html"}]}
