{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39174", "Description": "Cachet is an open source status page system. Prior to version 2.5.1, authenticated users, regardless of their privileges (User or Admin), can leak the value of any configuration entry of the dotenv file, e.g. the application secret (`APP_KEY`) and various passwords (email, database, etc). This issue was addressed in version 2.5.1 by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and preventing the use of nested variables in the resulting dotenv configuration file. As a workaround, only allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39174", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCatchethq\u00bbCatchetVersions  before (<) 2.5.1cpe:2.3:a:catchethq:catchet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "43.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  59.25%  43.97%  -15.29 \n 2  2025-03-29  43.97%  59.25%  +15.29 \n 3  2025-03-28  59.25%  43.97%  -15.29 \n 4  2025-03-27  54.97%  59.25%  +4.28 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.61%  54.97%  +54.36 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.50%  0.61%  +0.11 \n 7  2024-09-29  0.35%  0.50%  +0.15 \n 8  2024-08-30  0.25%  0.35%  +0.10 \n 9  2024-08-15  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 10  2024-07-19  0.24%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-11-19  0.19%  0.24%  +0.06 \n 12  2023-05-08  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 13  2023-04-18  0.15%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 14  2023-04-04  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 15  2023-03-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 16  2023-03-07  11.75%  0.11%  -11.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-75 Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/75/Failure-to-Sanitize-Special-Elements-into-a-Different-Plane-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/security/advisories/GHSA-88f9-7xxh-c688", "ref_desc": "Configuration leak \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fiveai/Cachet \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/releases/tag/v2.5.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.5.1 \u00b7 fiveai/Cachet \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pvfSW2RADa1NrSkRo2nAAS7oOD8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/", "ref_desc": "Cachet 2.4: Code Execution via Laravel Configuration InjectionExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vZ5Uc9LsoWwAYlhmSl7EBBgSn8Q.html"}]}
