{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39171", "Description": "Passport-SAML is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport, the Node.js authentication library. Prior to version 3.1.0, a malicious SAML payload can require transforms that consume significant system resources to process, thereby resulting in reduced or denied service. This would be an effective way to perform a denial-of-service attack. This has been resolved in version 3.1.0. The resolution is to limit the number of allowable transforms to 2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39171", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPassport-saml Project\u00bbPassport-saml\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:passport-saml_project:passport-saml:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.43%  0.36%  -0.07 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.36%  0.43%  +0.07 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.36%  +0.26 \n 4  2024-05-12  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-02  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-20  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-saml/passport-saml/pull/595", "ref_desc": "Limit transforms for signed nodes by pp-ps \u00b7 Pull Request #595 \u00b7 node-saml/passport-saml \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-saml/passport-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-5379-r78w-42h2", "ref_desc": "Unlimited transforms allowed for signed nodes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 node-saml/passport-saml \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
