{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39138", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39138", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.5.1cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.22%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.22%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-05-03  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-24  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 7  2024-02-27  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-23r4-5mxp-c7g5", "ref_desc": "New anonymous user session acts as if it's created with password \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/4.5.1", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/147bd9a3dc43391e92c36e05d5db860b04ca27db", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-23r4-5mxp-c7g5 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@147bd9a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
