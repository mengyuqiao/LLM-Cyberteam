{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32813", "Description": "Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.4.13, there exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the Connection header. Active exploitation of this issue is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to a privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this issue to prevent any potential abuse. If one has a chain of Traefik middlewares, and one of them sets a request header, then sending a request with a certain Connection header will cause it to be removed before the request is sent. In this case, the backend does not see the request header. A patch is available in version 2.4.13. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32813", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nTraefik\u00bbTraefikVersions  before (<) 2.4.13cpe:2.3:a:traefik:traefik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-15  0.42%  0.38%  -0.04 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.60%  0.42%  -0.18 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.42%  0.60%  +0.18 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.34%  0.42%  +0.08 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.34%  +0.09 \n 6  2024-04-18  0.22%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-03-09  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-02-12  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-25  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-11  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.18%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-913 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/913/Improper-Control-of-Dynamically-Managed-Code-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.4.13", "ref_desc": "Release v2.4.13 \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/security/advisories/GHSA-m697-4v8f-55qg", "ref_desc": "Drop Headers via Malicious Connection Header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/8319/commits/cbaf86a93014a969b8accf39301932c17d0d73f9", "ref_desc": "Remove hop-by-hop headers defined in connection header before some middleware by ldez \u00b7 Pull Request #8319 \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
