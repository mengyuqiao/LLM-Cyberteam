{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39159", "Description": "BinderHub is a kubernetes-based cloud service that allows users to share reproducible interactive computing environments from code repositories. In affected versions a remote code execution vulnerability has been identified in BinderHub, where providing BinderHub with maliciously crafted input could execute code in the BinderHub context, with the potential to egress credentials of the BinderHub deployment, including JupyterHub API tokens, kubernetes service accounts, and docker registry credentials. This may provide the ability to manipulate images and other user created pods in the deployment, with the potential to escalate to the host depending on the underlying kubernetes configuration. Users are advised to update to version 0.2.0-n653. If users are unable to update they may disable the git repo provider by specifying the `BinderHub.repo_providers` as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39159", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbBinderhubVersions  before (<) 0.2.0-n653cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:binderhub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  3.98%  1.32%  -2.66 \n 2  2025-03-29  1.32%  3.98%  +2.66 \n 3  2025-03-20  1.41%  1.32%  -0.09 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.72%  1.41%  +0.69 \n 5  2024-10-26  0.51%  0.72%  +0.21 \n 6  2024-07-31  0.48%  0.51%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-05-10  0.40%  0.48%  +0.08 \n 8  2024-03-31  0.37%  0.40%  +0.03 \n 9  2024-03-05  0.37%  0.37%  0.00 \n 10  2024-02-07  0.36%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-08-10  0.35%  0.36%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-18  0.33%  0.35%  +0.02 \n 13  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.33%  -1.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/security/advisories/GHSA-9jjr-qqfp-ppwx", "ref_desc": "remote code execution via git repo provider \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterhub/binderhub \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/commit/195caac172690456dcdc8cc7a6ca50e05abf8182.patch", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
