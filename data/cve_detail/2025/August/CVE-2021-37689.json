{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37689", "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions an attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a null pointer dereference, which would result in a crash and denial of service. This is caused by the MLIR optimization of `L2NormalizeReduceAxis` operator. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/lite/transforms/optimize.cc#L67-L70) unconditionally dereferences a pointer to an iterator to a vector without checking that the vector has elements. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit d6b57f461b39fd1aa8c1b870f1b974aac3554955. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37689", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.5.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.6.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.6.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.6.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.04%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-wf5p-c75w-w3wh", "ref_desc": "Null pointer dereference in TFLite MLIR optimizations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d6b57f461b39fd1aa8c1b870f1b974aac3554955", "ref_desc": "Prevent nullptr dereference in MLIR TFLite dialect/optimizer. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@d6b57f4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
