{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39155", "Description": "Istio is an open source platform for providing a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies and aggregate telemetry data. According to [RFC 4343](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4343), Istio authorization policy should compare the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case insensitive way, but currently the comparison is case sensitive. The proxy will route the request hostname in a case-insensitive way which means the authorization policy could be bypassed. As an example, the user may have an authorization policy that rejects request with hostname \"httpbin.foo\" for some source IPs, but the attacker can bypass this by sending the request with hostname \"Httpbin.Foo\". Patches are available in Istio 1.11.1, Istio 1.10.4 and Istio 1.9.8. As a work around a Lua filter may be written to normalize Host header before the authorization check. This is similar to the Path normalization presented in the [Security Best Practices](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-practices/security/#case-normalization) guide.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39155", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  before (<) 1.9.8cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.4cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.1cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-31  0.21%  0.13%  -0.08 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.44%  0.21%  -0.23 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.21%  0.44%  +0.23 \n 4  2025-03-20  0.13%  0.21%  +0.08 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-05-09  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-03-30  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-17  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-178 Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/178/Improper-Handling-of-Case-Sensitivity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4343", "ref_desc": "rfc4343Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/istio/security/advisories/GHSA-7774-7vr3-cc8j", "ref_desc": "Authorization Policy Bypass Due to Case Insensitive Host Comparison \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 istio/istio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
