{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39164", "Description": "Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39164", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.41.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.30%  0.50%  -0.80 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.50%  1.30%  +0.80 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.08%  0.50%  +0.43 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.41.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.41.1 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/f0xQU5z06sM2W9x_hJqyUK_0ylk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXT7ID7DNBRN2TVTETU3SYQHJKEG6PXN/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: matrix-synapse-1.41.1-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/M4fdST8idyhyBk3KACF3u--eF3U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2VHDEPCZ22GJFMZCWA2XZAGPOEV72POF/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: matrix-synapse-1.41.1-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pd55dqBhYYdNVA8OPWJr-c3Qybw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/cb35df940a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jj53-8fmw-f2w2 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse@cb35df9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SOGyTjVVJw_AgVzP5mjiF6YqeGc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3x4c-pq33-4w3q", "ref_desc": "Improper authorisation of /members discloses room membership to non-members \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
