{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39178", "Description": "Next.js is a React framework. Versions of Next.js between 10.0.0 and 11.0.0 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability. In order for an instance to be affected by the vulnerability, the `next.config.js` file must have `images.domains` array assigned and the image host assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided SVG. If the `next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other than default or the instance is deployed on Vercel, the instance is not affected by the vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in Next.js version 11.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39178", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nVercel\u00bbNext.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 11.1.1cpe:2.3:a:vercel:next.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.70% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.60%  0.70%  +0.10 \n 2  2025-06-01  0.70%  0.60%  -0.10 \n 3  2025-05-31  0.61%  0.70%  +0.09 \n 4  2025-05-06  0.29%  0.61%  +0.32 \n 5  2025-05-04  0.37%  0.29%  -0.08 \n 6  2025-05-01  0.29%  0.37%  +0.08 \n 7  2025-04-03  0.31%  0.29%  -0.02 \n 8  2025-03-30  2.68%  0.31%  -2.37 \n 9  2025-03-29  0.31%  2.68%  +2.37 \n 10  2025-03-24  2.68%  0.31%  -2.37 \n 11  2025-03-23  0.31%  2.68%  +2.37 \n 12  2025-03-20  0.28%  0.31%  +0.03 \n 13  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.28%  +0.22 \n 14  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  0.00 \n 15  2024-05-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 16  2024-04-05  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 17  2023-03-23  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 18  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9gr3-7897-pp7m", "ref_desc": "XSS in Image Optimization API for Next.js versions between 10.0.0 and 11.1.0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v11.1.1", "ref_desc": "Release v11.1.1 \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
