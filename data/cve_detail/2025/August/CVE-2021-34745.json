{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34745", "Description": "A vulnerability in the AppDynamics .NET Agent for Windows could allow an attacker to leverage an authenticated, local user account to gain SYSTEM privileges. This vulnerability is due to the .NET Agent Coordinator Service executing code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker with local access to a device that is running the vulnerable agent could create a custom process that would be launched with those SYSTEM privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is fixed in AppDynamics .NET Agent Release 21.7.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34745", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAppdynamics .net Agent\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 21.7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:appdynamics_.net_agent:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PAA/Security+Advisory%3A+AppDynamics+.NET+Agent+Privilege+Escalation+Vulnerability", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory: AppDynamics .NET Agent Privilege Escalation Vulnerability - Product Announcements and Alerts - AppDynamics DocumentationPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
