{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37693", "Description": "Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion. In Discourse before versions 2.7.8 and 2.8.0.beta4, when adding additional email addresses to an existing account on a Discourse site an email token is generated as part of the email verification process. Deleting the additional email address does not invalidate an unused token which can then be used in other contexts, including reseting a password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37693", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  before (<) 2.7.8cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.62%  0.32%  -0.30 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.32%  0.62%  +0.30 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.32%  +0.25 \n 4  2024-04-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/fb14e50741a4880cda22244eded8858e2f5336ef", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Destroy `EmailToken` when `EmailChangeRequest` is destroyed\u2026 \u00b7 discourse/discourse@fb14e50 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-9377-96f4-cww4", "ref_desc": "Re-use of email tokens \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
