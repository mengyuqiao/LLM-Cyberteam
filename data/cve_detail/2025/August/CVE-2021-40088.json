{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40088", "Description": "An issue was discovered in PrimeKey EJBCA before 7.6.0. CMP RA Mode can be configured to use a known client certificate to authenticate enrolling clients. The same RA client certificate is used for revocation requests as well. While enrollment enforces multi tenancy constraints (by verifying that the client certificate has access to the CA and Profiles being enrolled against), this check was not performed when authenticating revocation operations, allowing a known tenant to revoke a certificate belonging to another tenant.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40088", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPrimekey\u00bbEjbca\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 7.6.0cpe:2.3:a:primekey:ejbca:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-03-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.primekey.com/news/posts/51", "ref_desc": "EJBCA Security Advisory - CMP Revocation Ignores Multi Tenancy Constraints - News / PrimeKey Announcements - PrimeKey SupportVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
