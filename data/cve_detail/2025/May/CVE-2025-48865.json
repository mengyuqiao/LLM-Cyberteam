{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48865", "Description": "Fabio is an HTTP(S) and TCP router for deploying applications managed by consul. Prior to version 1.6.6, Fabio allows clients to remove X-Forwarded headers (except X-Forwarded-For) due to a vulnerability in how it processes hop-by-hop headers. Fabio adds HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Port when routing requests to backend applications. Since the receiving application should trust these headers, allowing HTTP clients to remove or modify them creates potential security vulnerabilities. Some of these custom headers can be removed and, in certain cases, manipulated. The attack relies on the behavior that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.6.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48865", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFabiolb\u00bbFabio\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.6.6cpe:2.3:a:fabiolb:fabio:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-348 Use of Less Trusted Source", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/348/Use-of-Less-Trusted-Source.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/commit/fdaf1e966162e9dd3b347ffdd0647b39dc71a1a3", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 fabiolb/fabio@fdaf1e9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/security/advisories/GHSA-q7p4-7xjv-j3wf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/tag/v1.6.6", "ref_desc": "Release v1.6.6 \u00b7 fabiolb/fabio \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
