A vulnerability present starting in version 3.0.5 up to and including version 4.6.3 allows an attacker to impersonate any user during SAML authentication by crafting a SAMLResponse. This can be done by using a valid SAML object that was signed by the configured IdP. Users are affected specifically when the service provider is using passport-wsfed-saml2 and a valid SAML document signed by the Identity Provider can be obtained. Version 4.6.4 contains a fix for the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46572", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-07  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-31  0.07%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-05-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-05-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/passport-wsfed-saml2/commit/e5cf3cc2a53748207f7a81bfba9195c8efa94181", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MkXVyw05IakYQaAjkyIQ6t1ggJ8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/passport-wsfed-saml2/security/advisories/GHSA-wjmp-wphq-jvqf", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
