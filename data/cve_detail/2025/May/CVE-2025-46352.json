{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46352", "Description": "The CS5000 Fire Panel is vulnerable due to a hard-coded password that \nruns on a VNC server and is visible as a string in the binary \nresponsible for running VNC. This password cannot be altered, allowing \nanyone with knowledge of it to gain remote access to the panel. Such \naccess could enable an attacker to operate the panel remotely, \npotentially putting the fire panel into a non-functional state and \ncausing serious safety issues.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46352", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-148-03", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/p1MOWK6EcF2uYKm6Uo-fHXBl7kw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.consiliumsafety.com/en/support/", "ref_desc": "Original spare parts, service and support | Consilium SafetyCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SDfamiMgdKpB6E9a1N44QpckUpg.html"}]}
