{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48371", "Description": "OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. OpenFGA versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.12 (corresponding to Helm chart openfga-0.2.16 through openfga-0.2.30 and docker 1.8.0 through 1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed. Users are affected under four specific conditions: First, calling Check API or ListObjects with an authorization model that has a relationship directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; second, there are check or list object queries with contextual tuples for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; third, those contextual tuples\u2019s user field is an userset; and finally, type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship. Users should upgrade to version 1.8.13 to receive a patch. The upgrade is backwards compatible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48371", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-28  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/e5960d4eba92b723de8ff3a5346a07f50c1379ca", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-c72g-53hw-82q7", "ref_desc": "OpenFGA Authorization Bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openfga/openfga \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
