{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46565", "Description": "Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Prior to versions 6.3.4, 6.2.7, 6.1.6, 5.4.19, and 4.5.14, the contents of files in the project root that are denied by a file matching pattern can be returned to the browser. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) are affected. Only files that are under project root and are denied by a file matching pattern can be bypassed. `server.fs.deny` can contain patterns matching against files (by default it includes .env, .env.*, *.{crt,pem} as such patterns). These patterns were able to bypass for files under `root` by using a combination of slash and dot (/.). This issue has been patched in versions 6.3.4, 6.2.7, 6.1.6, 5.4.19, and 4.5.14.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46565", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-15  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-05-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/c22c43de612eebb6c182dd67850c24e4fab8cacb", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-859w-5945-r5v3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
