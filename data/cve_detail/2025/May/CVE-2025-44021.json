{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-44021", "Description": "OpenStack Ironic before 29.0.1 can write unintended files to a target node disk during image handling (if a deployment was performed via the API). A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-44021", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 1 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  0.01%  0.01%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2025-001.html", "ref_desc": "OSSA-2025-001: Ironic fails to restrict paths used for file:// image URLs \u2014 OpenStack Security Advisories 0.0.1.dev291 documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/08/1", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2107847", "ref_desc": "Bug #2107847 \u201c[OSSA-2025-001] (CVE-2025-44021) Can image a node ...\u201d : Bugs : Ironic", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
