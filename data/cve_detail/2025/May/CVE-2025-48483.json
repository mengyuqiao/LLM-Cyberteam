{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48483", "Description": "FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.180, the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to incorrect input validation and sanitization of user-input data during mail signature sanitization. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code, including JavaScript scripts, into the page processed by the user's browser, allowing them to steal sensitive data, hijack user sessions, or conduct other malicious activities. Additionally, if an administrator accesses one of these emails with a modified signature, it could result in a subsequent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48483", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nFreescout\u00bbFreescoutVersions  before (<) 1.8.180cpe:2.3:a:freescout:freescout:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.02%  0.02%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-g2vq-qwx2-pc2m", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
