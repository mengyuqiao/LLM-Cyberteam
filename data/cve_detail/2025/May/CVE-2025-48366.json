{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48366", "Description": "Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool. Prior to versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20, a stored and blind XSS vulnerability exists in the Phone Number field of the user profile within the GroupOffice application. This allows a malicious actor to inject persistent JavaScript payloads, which are triggered in the context of another user when they view the Address Book. Successful exploitation enables actions such as forced redirects, unauthorized fetch requests, or other arbitrary JavaScript execution without user interaction. Versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20 contain a fix for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48366", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nIntermesh\u00bbGroup-officeVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.1andbefore (<) 25.0.20cpe:2.3:a:intermesh:group-office:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIntermesh\u00bbGroup-officeVersions  before (<) 6.8.199cpe:2.3:a:intermesh:group-office:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-30  0.10%  0.04%  -0.07 \n 2  2025-05-28  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-87 Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/87/Improper-Neutralization-of-Alternate-XSS-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-phhq-3h8f-qxpx", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
