{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47952", "Description": "Traefik (pronounced traffic) is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to versions 2.11.25 and 3.4.1, there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a URL encoded string in its path, it\u2019s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.25 and 3.4.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47952", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.02%  0.02%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/security/advisories/GHSA-vrch-868g-9jx5", "ref_desc": "Path traversal still possible using url encoding \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.11.25", "ref_desc": "Release v2.11.25 \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/commit/08d5dfee0164aa54dd44a467870042e18e8d3f00", "ref_desc": "Normalize request path \u00b7 traefik/traefik@08d5dfe \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.4.1", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
