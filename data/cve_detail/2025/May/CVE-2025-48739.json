{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48739", "Description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in StrangeBee TheHive 5.2.0 before 5.2.16, 5.3.0 before 5.3.11, 5.4.0 before 5.4.10, and 5.5.0 before 5.5.1 allows remote authenticated attackers with admin permissions (allowing them to access specific API endpoints) to manipulate URLs to direct requests to unexpected hosts or ports. This allows the attacker to use a TheHive server as a proxy to reach internal or otherwise restricted resources. This could be exploited to access other servers on the internal network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48739", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-29  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/StrangeBeeCorp/Security/blob/main/Security%20advisories/SB-SEC-ADV-2025-002.md", "ref_desc": "Security/Security advisories/SB-SEC-ADV-2025-002.md at main \u00b7 StrangeBeeCorp/Security \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
