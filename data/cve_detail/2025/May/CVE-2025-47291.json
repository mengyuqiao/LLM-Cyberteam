{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47291", "Description": "containerd is an open-source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where containerd, starting in version 2.0.1 and prior to version 2.0.5, doesn't put usernamespaced containers under the Kubernetes' cgroup hierarchy, therefore some Kubernetes limits are not honored. This may cause a denial of service of the Kubernetes node. This bug has been fixed in containerd 2.0.5+ and 2.1.0+. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, disable usernamespaced pods in Kubernetes temporarily.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47291", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-27  0.01%  0.02%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-266 Incorrect Privilege Assignment", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/266/Incorrect-Privilege-Assignment.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-cxfp-7pvr-95ff", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
