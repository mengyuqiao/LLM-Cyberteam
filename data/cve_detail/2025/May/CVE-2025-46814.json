{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46814", "Description": "FastAPI Guard is a security library for FastAPI that provides middleware to control IPs, log requests, and detect penetration attempts. An HTTP header injection vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.0.0. By manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header, an attacker can potentially inject arbitrary IP addresses into the request. This vulnerability can allow attackers to bypass IP-based access controls, mislead logging systems, and impersonate trusted clients. It is especially impactful when the application relies on the X-Forwarded-For header for IP-based authorization or authentication. Users should upgrade to FastAPI Guard version 2.0.0 to receive a fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46814", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-31  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-05-12  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/commit/0b003fda4c678c1b514e95f319aee88113e9bf4b", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/security/advisories/GHSA-77q8-qmj7-x7pp", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
