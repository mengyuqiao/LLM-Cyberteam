{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46722", "Description": "vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). In versions starting from 0.7.0 to before 0.9.0, in the file vllm/multimodal/hasher.py, the MultiModalHasher class has a security and data integrity issue in its image hashing method. Currently, it serializes PIL.Image.Image objects using only obj.tobytes(), which returns only the raw pixel data, without including metadata such as the image\u2019s shape (width, height, mode). As a result, two images of different sizes (e.g., 30x100 and 100x30) with the same pixel byte sequence could generate the same hash value. This may lead to hash collisions, incorrect cache hits, and even data leakage or security risks. This issue has been patched in version 0.9.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46722", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1023 Incomplete Comparison with Missing Factors", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1023/Incomplete-Comparison-with-Missing-Factors.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1288 Improper Validation of Consistency within Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1288/Improper-Validation-of-Consistency-within-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/99404f53c72965b41558aceb1bc2380875f5d848", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/17378", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-c65p-x677-fgj6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
