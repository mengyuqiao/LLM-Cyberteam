{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-37946", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/pci: Fix duplicate pci_dev_put() in disable_slot() when PF has child VFs\n\nWith commit bcb5d6c76903 (\"s390/pci: introduce lock to synchronize state\nof zpci_dev's\") the code to ignore power off of a PF that has child VFs\nwas changed from a direct return to a goto to the unlock and\npci_dev_put() section. The change however left the existing pci_dev_put()\nuntouched resulting in a doubple put. This can subsequently cause a use\nafter free if the struct pci_dev is released in an unexpected state.\nFix this by removing the extra pci_dev_put().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37946", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.02%  0.02%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/05a2538f2b48500cf4e8a0a0ce76623cc5bafcf1", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c488f8b53e156d6dcc0514ef0afa3a33376b8f9e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/957529baef142d95e0d1b1bea786675bd47dbe53", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
