{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46821", "Description": "Envoy is a cloud-native edge/middle/service proxy. Prior to versions 1.34.1, 1.33.3, 1.32.6, and 1.31.8, Envoy's URI template matcher incorrectly excludes the `*` character from a set of valid characters in the URI path. As a result URI path containing the `*` character will not match a URI template expressions. This can result in bypass of RBAC rules when configured using the `uri_template` permissions. This vulnerability is fixed in Envoy versions v1.34.1, v1.33.3, v1.32.6, v1.31.8. As a workaround, configure additional RBAC permissions using `url_path` with `safe_regex` expression.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46821", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-13  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-186 Overly Restrictive Regular Expression", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/186/Overly-Restrictive-Regular-Expression.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-c7cm-838g-6g67", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
