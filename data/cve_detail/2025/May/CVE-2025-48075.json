{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48075", "Description": "Fiber is an Express-inspired web framework written in Go. Starting in version 2.52.6 and prior to version 2.52.7, `fiber.Ctx.BodyParser` can map flat data to nested slices using `key[idx]value` syntax, but when idx is negative, it causes a panic instead of returning an error stating it cannot process the data. Since this data is user-provided, this could lead to denial of service for anyone relying on this `fiber.Ctx.BodyParser`  functionality. Version 2.52.7 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48075", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGofiber\u00bbFiber\u00bbForGOVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.52.7cpe:2.3:a:gofiber:fiber:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-30  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2025-05-28  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/129/Improper-Validation-of-Array-Index.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-hg3g-gphw-5hhm", "ref_desc": "Panic when fiber.Ctx.BodyParser parses invalid range index \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gofiber/fiber \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory;Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/commit/e115c08b8f059a4a031b492aa9eef0712411853d", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 gofiber/fiber@e115c08 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
