{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-40556", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in BACnet ATEC 550-440 (All versions), BACnet ATEC 550-441 (All versions), BACnet ATEC 550-445 (All versions), BACnet ATEC 550-446 (All versions). Affected devices improperly handle specific incoming BACnet MSTP messages. This could allow an attacker residing in the same BACnet network to send a specially crafted MSTP message that results in a denial of service condition of the targeted device. A power cycle is required to restore the device's normal operation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40556", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-03  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-828116.html", "ref_desc": "SSA-828116", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
