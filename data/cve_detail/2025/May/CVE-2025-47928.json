{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47928", "Description": "Spotipy is a Python library for the Spotify Web API. As of commit 4f5759dbfb4506c7b6280572a4db1aabc1ac778d, using `pull_request_target` on `.github/workflows/integration_tests.yml` followed by the checking out the head.sha of a forked PR can be exploited by attackers, since untrusted code can be executed having full access to secrets (from the base repo). By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate `GITHUB_TOKEN` and secrets `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`,  `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`. In particular `GITHUB_TOKEN` which can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges. The `pull_request_target` in GitHub Actions is a major security concern\u2014especially in public repositories\u2014because it executes untrusted code from a PR, but with the context of the base repository, including access to its secrets. Commit 9dfb7177b8d7bb98a5a6014f8e6436812a47576f reverted the change that caused the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47928", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-21  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-488 Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/488/Exposure-of-Data-Element-to-Wrong-Session.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/commit/4f5759dbfb4506c7b6280572a4db1aabc1ac778d", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/commit/9dfb7177b8d7bb98a5a6014f8e6436812a47576f", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/security/advisories/GHSA-h25v-8c87-rvm8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
