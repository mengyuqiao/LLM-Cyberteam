{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48370", "Description": "auth-js is an isomorphic Javascript library for Supabase Auth. Prior to version 2.69.1, the library functions getUserById, deleteUser, updateUserById, listFactors and deleteFactor did not require the user supplied values to be valid UUIDs. This could lead to a URL path traversal, resulting in the wrong API function being called. Implementations that follow security best practice and validate user controlled inputs, such as the userId are not affected by this. This issue has been patched in version 2.69.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48370", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-06-02  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/supabase/auth-js/pull/1063", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/supabase/auth-js/security/advisories/GHSA-8r88-6cj9-9fh5", "ref_desc": "Insecure path routing on malformed user input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 supabase/auth-js \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
