{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47285", "Description": "Vyper is the Pythonic Programming Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In versions up to and including 0.4.2rc1, `concat()` may skip evaluation of side effects when the length of an argument is zero. This is due to a fastpath in the implementation which skips evaluation of argument expressions when their length is zero. In practice, it would be very unusual in user code to construct zero-length bytestrings using an expression with side-effects, since zero-length bytestrings are typically constructed with the empty literal `b\"\"`; the only way to construct an empty bytestring which has side effects would be with the ternary operator introduced in v0.3.8, e.g. `b\"\" if self.do_some_side_effect() else b\"\"`. The fix is available in pull request 4644 and expected to be part of the 0.4.2 release. As a workaround, don't have side effects in expressions which construct zero-length bytestrings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47285", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-691 Insufficient Control Flow Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/691/Insufficient-Control-Flow-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/4644", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/68b68c4b30c5ef2f312b4674676170b8a6eaa316/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L560-L562", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-qhr6-mgqr-mchm", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
