{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46820", "Description": "phpgt/Dom provides access to modern DOM APIs. Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8 expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact. The ci.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the build artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the GitHub API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. Any downstream user of the repository may be affected, but the token should only be valid for the duration of the workflow run, limiting the time during which exploitation could occur. Version 4.1.8 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46820", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-07  0.01%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-12  0.03%  0.01%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-538 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/538/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Externally-Accessibl.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/phpgt/Dom/commit/205cddcc82c002dfa48e874494efbf4c49497394", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/phpgt/Dom/security/advisories/GHSA-cwj7-6v67-2cm4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
