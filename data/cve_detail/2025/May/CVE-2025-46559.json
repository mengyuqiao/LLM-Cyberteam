{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46559", "Description": "Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`. Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46559", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-06  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-11  0.03%  0.03%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/583df3ec63e25a1fd34def0dac13405396b8b663", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-gmq6-738q-vjp2", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
