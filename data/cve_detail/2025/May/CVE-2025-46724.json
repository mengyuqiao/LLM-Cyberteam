{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46724", "Description": "Langroid is a Python framework to build large language model (LLM)-powered applications. Prior to version 0.53.15, `TableChatAgent` uses `pandas eval()`. If fed by untrusted user input, like the case of a public-facing LLM application, it may be vulnerable to code injection. Langroid 0.53.15 sanitizes input to `TableChatAgent` by default to tackle the most common attack vectors, and added several warnings about the risky behavior in the project documentation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46724", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/langroid/langroid/commit/0d9e4a7bb3ae2eef8d38f2e970ff916599a2b2a6", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/knfj-3fZEyIGLwzHTq0ZwjpESdE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/langroid/langroid/security/advisories/GHSA-jqq5-wc57-f8hj", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
