{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48368", "Description": "Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool. Prior to versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20, a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the GroupOffice application, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a crafted payload into a parameter that is later processed unsafely in the DOM. Versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20 contain a fix for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48368", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nIntermesh\u00bbGroup-officeVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.1andbefore (<) 25.0.20cpe:2.3:a:intermesh:group-office:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIntermesh\u00bbGroup-officeVersions  before (<) 6.8.199cpe:2.3:a:intermesh:group-office:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-30  0.06%  0.03%  -0.03 \n 2  2025-05-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-c49j-qvp9-vgg6", "ref_desc": "DOM-Based XSS in all Date Input Fields Allow Arbitrary JavaScript Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Intermesh/groupoffice \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory;Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
