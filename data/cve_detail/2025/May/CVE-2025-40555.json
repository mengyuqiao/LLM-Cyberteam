{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-40555", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in APOGEE PXC+TALON TC Series (BACnet) (All versions). Affected devices start sending unsolicited BACnet broadcast messages after processing a specific BACnet createObject request. This could allow an attacker residing in the same BACnet network to send a specially crafted message that results in a partial denial of service condition of the targeted device, and potentially reduce the availability of BACnet network. A power cycle is required to restore the device's normal operation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40555", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-03  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-19  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-440 Expected Behavior Violation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/440/Expected-Behavior-Violation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-718393.html", "ref_desc": "SSA-718393", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
