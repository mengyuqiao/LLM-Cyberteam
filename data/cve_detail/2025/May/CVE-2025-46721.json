{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46721", "Description": "nosurf is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection middleware for Go. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46721", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-19  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf-cve-2025-46721", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf/commit/ec9bb776d8e5ba9e906b6eb70428f4e7b009feee", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf/security/advisories/GHSA-w9hf-35q4-vcjw", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rq77-p4h8-4crw", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
