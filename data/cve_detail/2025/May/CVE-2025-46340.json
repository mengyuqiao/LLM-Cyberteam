{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46340", "Description": "Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46340", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-06  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/d10fdfe9738b17a9d81037c031b40a2cc4cb8038", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-3p2w-xmv5-jm95", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
