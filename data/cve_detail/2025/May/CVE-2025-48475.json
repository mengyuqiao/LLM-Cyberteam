{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48475", "Description": "FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.180, the System does not provide a check on which \"clients\" of the System an authorized user can view and edit, and which ones they cannot. As a result, an authorized user who does not have access to any of the existing mailboxes, as well as to any of the existing conversations, has the ability to view and edit the System's clients. The limitation of client visibility can be implemented by the limit_user_customer_visibility setting, however, in the specified scenarios, there is no check for the presence of this setting. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48475", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-xvch-f75c-8w8q", "ref_desc": "Insufficient authorization [4] \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 freescout-help-desk/freescout \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/commit/1f154ce039618ed5abd960c97619c23534c0717a", "ref_desc": "Take into account APP_LIMIT_USER_CUSTOMER_VISIBILITY option on custom\u2026 \u00b7 freescout-help-desk/freescout@1f154ce \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
