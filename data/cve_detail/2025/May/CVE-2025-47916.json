{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47916", "Description": "Invision Community 5.0.0 before 5.0.7 allows remote code execution via crafted template strings to themeeditor.php. The issue lies within the themeeditor controller (file: /applications/core/modules/front/system/themeeditor.php), where a protected method named customCss can be invoked by unauthenticated users. This method passes the value of the content parameter to the Theme::makeProcessFunction() method; hence it is evaluated by the template engine. Accordingly, this can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by providing crafted template strings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47916", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "75.59% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-27  78.20%  75.59%  -2.61 \n 2  2025-05-22  2.04%  78.20%  +76.16 \n 3  2025-05-19  0.22%  2.04%  +1.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1336 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1336/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-Used-in-a-Templa.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://karmainsecurity.com/KIS-2025-02", "ref_desc": "Invision Community <= 5.0.6 (customCss) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | Karma(In)Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/May/4", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [KIS-2025-02] Invision Community <= 5.0.6 (customCss) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://invisioncommunity.com/release-notes-v5/507-r41/", "ref_desc": "5.0.7 - Release Notes v5", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
