{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-37886", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npds_core: make wait_context part of q_info\n\nMake the wait_context a full part of the q_info struct rather\nthan a stack variable that goes away after pdsc_adminq_post()\nis done so that the context is still available after the wait\nloop has given up.\n\nThere was a case where a slow development firmware caused\nthe adminq request to time out, but then later the FW finally\nfinished the request and sent the interrupt.  The handler tried\nto complete_all() the completion context that had been created\non the stack in pdsc_adminq_post() but no longer existed.\nThis caused bad pointer usage, kernel crashes, and much wailing\nand gnashing of teeth.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37886", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-15  0.02%  0.02%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3f77c3dfffc7063428b100c4945ca2a7a8680380", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d7c4b2b0bbfb09b55b2dc0e2355d7936bf89381", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/520f012fe75fb8efc9f16a57ef929a7a2115d892", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66d7702b42ffdf0dce4808626088268a4e905ca6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
