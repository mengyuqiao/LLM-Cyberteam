{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46567", "Description": "LLama Factory enables fine-tuning of large language models. Prior to version 1.0.0, a critical vulnerability exists in the `llamafy_baichuan2.py` script of the LLaMA-Factory project. The script performs insecure deserialization using `torch.load()` on user-supplied `.bin` files from an input directory. An attacker can exploit this behavior by crafting a malicious `.bin` file that executes arbitrary commands during deserialization. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46567", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-02  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/commit/2989d39239d2f46e584c1e1180ba46b9768afb2a", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/security/advisories/GHSA-f2f7-gj54-6vpv", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
