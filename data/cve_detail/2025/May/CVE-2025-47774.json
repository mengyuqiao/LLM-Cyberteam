{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47774", "Description": "Vyper is the Pythonic Programming Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In versions up to and including 0.4.2rc1, the `slice()` builtin can elide side effects when the output length is 0, and the source bytestring is a builtin (`msg.data` or `<address>.code`). The reason is that for these source locations, the check that `length >= 1` is skipped. The result is that a 0-length bytestring constructed with slice can be passed to `make_byte_array_copier`, which elides evaluation of its source argument when the max length is 0. The impact is that side effects in the `start` argument may be elided when the `length` argument is 0, e.g. `slice(msg.data, self.do_side_effect(), 0)`. The fix in pull request 4645 disallows any invocation of `slice()` with length 0, including for the ad hoc locations discussed in this advisory. The fix is expected to be part of version 0.4.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47774", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-21  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-691 Insufficient Control Flow Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/691/Insufficient-Control-Flow-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/4645", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/68b68c4b30c5ef2f312b4674676170b8a6eaa316/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L315-L319", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/68b68c4b30c5ef2f312b4674676170b8a6eaa316/vyper/codegen/core.py#L189-L191", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-3vcg-j39x-cwfm", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
