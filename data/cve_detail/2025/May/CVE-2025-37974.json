Add the\nmissing check in __clp_add() where it was missed when adding the\nscan_list in the fixed commit. Simply not adding the device to the scan\nlist results in the previous behavior.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37974", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.02%  0.02%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2769b718e164df983c20c314b263a71a699be6cd", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/42420c50c68f3e95e90de2479464f420602229fc", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/be54b750c333a9db7c3b3686846bb06b07b011fe", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
