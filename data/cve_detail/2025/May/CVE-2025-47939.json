{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47939", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source, PHP based web content management system. By design, the file management module in TYPO3\u2019s backend user interface has historically allowed the upload of any file type, with the exception of those that are directly executable in a web server context. This lack of restriction means it is possible to upload files that may be considered potentially harmful, such as executable binaries (e.g., `.exe` files), or files with inconsistent file extensions and MIME types (for example, a file incorrectly named with a `.png` extension but actually carrying the MIME type `application/zip`) starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, and 13.4.12 LTS. Although such files are not directly executable through the web server, their presence can introduce indirect risks. For example, third-party services such as antivirus scanners or malware detection systems might flag or block access to the website for end users if suspicious files are found. This could negatively affect the availability or reputation of the site. Users should update to TYPO3 version 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47939", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-351 Insufficient Type Distinction", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/351/Insufficient-Type-Distinction.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2025-014", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2025-014: Unrestricted File Upload in File Abstraction Layer", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-9hq9-cr36-4wpj", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
