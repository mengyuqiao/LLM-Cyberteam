{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47279", "Description": "Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js. Prior to versions 5.29.0, 6.21.2, and 7.5.0, applications that use undici to implement a webhook-like system are vulnerable. If the attacker set up a server with an invalid certificate, and they can force the application to call the webhook repeatedly, then they can cause a memory leak. This has been patched in versions 5.29.0, 6.21.2, and 7.5.0. As a workaound, avoid calling a webhook repeatedly if the webhook fails.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47279", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-21  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-cxrh-j4jr-qwg3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/4088", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/3895", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
