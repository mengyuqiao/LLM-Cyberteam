{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47280", "Description": "Umbraco Forms is a form builder that integrates with the Umbraco content management system. Starting in the 7.x branch and prior to versions 13.4.2 and 15.1.2, the 'Send email' workflow does not HTML encode the user-provided field values in the sent email message, making any form with this workflow configured vulnerable, as it allows sending the message from a trusted system and address, potentially bypassing spam and email client security systems. This issue affects all (supported) versions Umbraco Forms and is patched in 13.4.2 and 15.1.2. Unpatched or unsupported versions can workaround this issue by using the `Send email with template (Razor)` workflow instead or writing a custom workflow type. To avoid accidentally using the vulnerable workflow again, the `SendEmail` workflow type can be removed using a composer available in the GitHub Security Advisory for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47280", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco FormsVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 13.4.2cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco FormsVersions  from including (>=) 14.0.0andbefore (<) 15.1.2cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-23  0.06%  0.03%  -0.03 \n 2  2025-05-19  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Issues/security/advisories/GHSA-2qrj-g9hq-chph", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
