{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47777", "Description": "5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Versions prior to 0.11.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in chatbot responses due to insufficient sanitization. This, in turn, can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via unsafe Electron protocol handling and exposed Electron APIs. All users of 5ire client versions prior to patched releases, particularly those interacting with untrusted chatbots or pasting external content, are affected. Version 0.11.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47777", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-20  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://shabarkin.notion.site/1-click-RCE-in-Electron-Applications-501c2e96e7934610979cd3c72e844a22", "ref_desc": "1-click RCE in Electron Applications", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROFYhS9E9eU", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce", "ref_desc": "Allow arbitrary URLs, expect arbitrary code execution | Positive Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/commit/56601e012095194a4be0d4cb6da6b5b3cb53dea8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/security/advisories/GHSA-mr8w-mmvv-6hq8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
