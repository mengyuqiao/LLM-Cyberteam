{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-37927", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/amd: Fix potential buffer overflow in parse_ivrs_acpihid\n\nThere is a string parsing logic error which can lead to an overflow of hid\nor uid buffers. Comparing ACPIID_LEN against a total string length doesn't\ntake into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers so the\ncheck is insufficient in some cases. For example if the length of hid\nstring is 4 and the length of the uid string is 260, the length of str\nwill be equal to ACPIID_LEN + 1 but uid string will overflow uid buffer\nwhich size is 256.\n\nThe same applies to the hid string with length 13 and uid string with\nlength 250.\n\nCheck the length of hid and uid strings separately to prevent\nbuffer overflow.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37927", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a65ebfed65fa62797ec1f5f1dcf7adb157a2de1e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/466d9da267079a8d3b69fa72dfa3a732e1f6dbb5", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c8bdfc0297965bb13fa439d36ca9c4f7c8447f0f", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/13d67528e1ae4486e9ab24b70122fab104c73c29", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8dee308e4c01dea48fc104d37f92d5b58c50b96c", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10d901a95f8e766e5aa0bb9a983fb41271f64718", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c3f37faa71f5d26dd2144b3f2b14525ec8f5e41f", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2b65060c84ee4d8dc64fae6d2728b528e9e832e1", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
