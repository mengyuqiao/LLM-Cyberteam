{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47930", "Description": "Zulip is an open-source team chat application. Starting in version 10.0 and prior to version 10.3, the \"Who can create public channels\" access control mechanism can be circumvented by creating a private or web-public channel, and then changing the channel privacy to public. A similar technique works for creating private channels without permission, though such a process requires either the API or modifying the HTML, as we do mark the \"private\" radio button as disabled in such cases. Version 10.3 contains a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47930", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-21  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-rqg7-xfqg-v7q5", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/changelog.html#zulip-server-10-3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/d2ff4bda4c3efa30fc3ab1f151255cfdbf370f78", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-create-channels", "ref_desc": "Restrict channel creation | Zulip help center", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
