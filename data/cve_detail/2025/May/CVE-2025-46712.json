{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46712", "Description": "Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. In versions prior to OTP-27.3.4 (for OTP-27), OTP-26.2.5.12 (for OTP-26), and OTP-25.3.2.21 (for OTP-25), Erlang/OTP SSH fails to enforce strict KEX handshake hardening measures by allowing optional messages to be exchanged. This allows a Man-in-the-Middle attacker to inject these messages in a connection during the handshake. This issue has been patched in versions OTP-27.3.4 (for OTP-27), OTP-26.2.5.12 (for OTP-26), and OTP-25.3.2.21 (for OTP-25).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46712", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  0.03%  0.03%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-440 Expected Behavior Violation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/440/Expected-Behavior-Violation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-26.2.5.12", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/erlang/otp/security/advisories/GHSA-934x-xq38-hhqf", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-25.3.2.21", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-27.3.4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
