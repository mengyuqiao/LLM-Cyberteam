{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48473", "Description": "FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.179, when creating a conversation from a message in another conversation, there is no check to ensure that the user has the ability to view this message. Thus, the user can view arbitrary messages from other mailboxes or from other conversations to which they do not have access (access restriction to conversations is implemented by the show_only_assigned_conversations setting, which is also not checked). This issue has been patched in version 1.8.179.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48473", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/commit/2552a2b84248824b73c35b2699aa86da644eea1a", "ref_desc": "Check from_thread_id parameter access permissions when creating new c\u2026 \u00b7 freescout-help-desk/freescout@2552a2b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-3x75-7856-r794", "ref_desc": "Insufficient authorization [2] \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 freescout-help-desk/freescout \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
