{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46723", "Description": "OpenVM is a performant and modular zkVM framework built for customization and extensibility. In version 1.0.0, OpenVM is vulnerable to overflow through byte decomposition of pc in AUIPC chip. A typo results in the highest limb of pc being range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This results in the if statement never being triggered because the enumeration gives i=0,1,2, when instead the enumeration should give i=1,2,3, leaving pc_limbs[3] range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This leads to a vulnerability where the pc_limbs decomposition differs from the true pc, which means a malicious prover can make the destination register take a different value than the AUIPC instruction dictates, by making the decomposition overflow the BabyBear field. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46723", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-03  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/131/Incorrect-Calculation-of-Buffer-Size.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/security/advisories/GHSA-jf2r-x3j4-23m7", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/releases/tag/v1.1.0", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cantina.xyz/code/c486d600-bed0-4fc6-aed1-de759fd29fa2/findings/21", "ref_desc": "Log in | Cantina", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/blob/0f94c8a3dfa7536c1231465d1bdee5fc607a5993/extensions/rv32im/circuit/src/auipc/core.rs#L135", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/commit/68da4b50c033da5603517064aa0a08e1bbf70a01", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
