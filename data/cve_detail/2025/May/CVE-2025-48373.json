{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48373", "Description": "Schule is open-source school management system software. The application relies on client-side JavaScript (index.js) to redirect users to different panels based on their role. Prior to version 1.0.1, this implementation poses a serious security risk because it assumes that the value of data.role is trustworthy on the client side. Attackers can manipulate JavaScript in the browser (e.g., via browser dev tools or intercepting API responses) and set data.role to any arbitrary value (e.g., \"admin\"), gaining unauthorized access to restricted areas of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48373", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/schule111/Schule/commit/cbf7f509c37acd69b4ab8ee19d842de867b46b7e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/schule111/Schule/security/advisories/GHSA-37h9-qq7c-6mc9", "ref_desc": "Client-Side Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Bypass Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 schule111/Schule \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
