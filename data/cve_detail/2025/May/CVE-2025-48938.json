{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48938", "Description": "go-gh is a collection of Go modules to make authoring GitHub CLI extensions easier. A security vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.12.1 where an attacker-controlled GitHub Enterprise Server could result in executing arbitrary commands on a user's machine by replacing HTTP URLs provided by GitHub with local file paths for browsing. In `2.12.1`, `Browser.Browse()` has been enhanced to allow and disallow a variety of scenarios to avoid opening or executing files on the filesystem without unduly impacting HTTP URLs. No known workarounds are available other than upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48938", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-501 Trust Boundary Violation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/501/Trust-Boundary-Violation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cli/go-gh/security/advisories/GHSA-g9f5-x53j-h563", "ref_desc": "Prevent GitHub CLI and extensions from executing arbitrary commands from compromised GitHub Enterprise Server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cli/go-gh \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cli/go-gh/commit/a08820a13f257d6c5b4cb86d37db559ec6d14577", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cli/go-gh/blob/61bf393cf4aeea6d00a6251390f5f67f5b67e727/pkg/browser/browser.go", "ref_desc": "go-gh/pkg/browser/browser.go at 61bf393cf4aeea6d00a6251390f5f67f5b67e727 \u00b7 cli/go-gh \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
