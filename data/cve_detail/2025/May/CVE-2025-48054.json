{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48054", "Description": "Radashi is a TypeScript utility toolkit. Prior to version 12.5.1, the set function within the Radashi library is vulnerable to prototype pollution. If an attacker can control parts of the path argument to the set function, they could potentially modify the prototype of all objects in the JavaScript runtime, leading to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or even remote code execution in some specific scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 12.5.1. A workaround for this issue involves sanitizing the path argument provided to the set function to ensure that no part of the path string is __proto__, prototype, or constructor.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48054", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-02  0.42%  0.56%  +0.13 \n 2  2025-05-28  0.57%  0.42%  -0.15 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/radashi-org/radashi/security/advisories/GHSA-2xv9-ghh9-xc69", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/radashi-org/radashi/commit/8147abc8cfc3cfe9b9a17cd389076a5d97235a66", "ref_desc": "fix(set): prevent prototype pollution \u00b7 radashi-org/radashi@8147abc \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
