{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46813", "Description": "Discourse is an open-source community platform. A data leak vulnerability affects sites deployed between commits 10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510 and 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b. On login-required sites, the leak meant that some content on the site's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users. Only login-required sites that got deployed during this timeframe are affected, roughly between April 30 2025 noon EDT and May 2 2025, noon EDT. Sites on the stable branch are unaffected. Private content on an instance's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users on login-required sites. Versions of 3.5.0.beta4 after commit 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b are not vulnerable to the issue. No workarounds are available. Sites must upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of Discourse.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46813", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-v3h7-c287-pfg9", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
