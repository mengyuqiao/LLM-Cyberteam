{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46833", "Description": "Programs/P73_SimplePythonEncryption.py illustrates a simple Python encryption example using the RSA Algorithm. In versions prior to commit 6ce60b1, an attacker may be able to decrypt the data using brute force attacks and because of this the whole application can be impacted. This issue has been patched in commit 6ce60b1. A workaround involves increasing the key size, for RSA or DSA this is at least 2048 bits, for ECC this is at least 256 bits.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46833", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 1 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  0.02%  0.01%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ShashikantSingh09/python-progrrames/commit/6ce60b1b2116a579a2e89de96d738a98f6ad4f27", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ShashikantSingh09/python-progrrames/security/advisories/GHSA-5h26-2c6g-4ch4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
