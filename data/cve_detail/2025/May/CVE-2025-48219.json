{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48219", "Description": "O2 UK before 2025-05-19 allows subscribers to determine the Cell ID of other subscribers by initiating an IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) call and then reading the utran-cell-id-3gpp field of a Cellular-Network-Info SIP header, aka an ECI (E-UTRAN Cell Identity) leak. The Cell ID might be usable to identify a cell location via crowdsourced data, and might correspond to a small physical area (e.g., if the called party is in a city centre). Removal of the Cellular-Network-Info header is mentioned in section 4.4.19 of ETSI TS 124 229.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48219", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-24  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-20  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/201/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-Into-Sent-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/124200_124299/124229/15.10.00_60/ts_124229v151000p.pdf", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mastdatabase.co.uk/blog/2025/05/o2-expose-customer-location-call-4g/", "ref_desc": "O2 VoLTE: locating any customer with a phone call | mastdatabase.co.uk", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44014046", "ref_desc": "O2 VoLTE: locating any customer with a phone call | Hacker News", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2025/05/o2-uk-fixes-volte-flaw-that-exposed-user-mobile-location-data.html", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
