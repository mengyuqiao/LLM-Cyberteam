{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48382", "Description": "Fess is a deployable Enterprise Search Server. Prior to version 14.19.2, the createTempFile() method in org.codelibs.fess.helper.SystemHelper creates temporary files without explicitly setting restrictive permissions. This could lead to potential information disclosure, allowing unauthorized local users to access sensitive data contained in these files. This issue primarily affects environments where Fess is deployed in a shared or multi-user context. Typical single-user or isolated deployments have minimal or negligible practical impact. This issue has been patched in version 14.19.2. A workaround for this issue involves ensuring local access to the environment running Fess is restricted to trusted users only.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48382", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-02  0.01%  0.02%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/codelibs/fess/commit/25b2009fea2a0f6ccd5aa8154aa54b536c08f6c4", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 codelibs/fess@25b2009 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codelibs/fess/security/advisories/GHSA-g88v-2j67-9rmx", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
