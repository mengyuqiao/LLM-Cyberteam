{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47277", "Description": "vLLM, an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs), has an issue in versions 0.6.5 through 0.8.4 that ONLY impacts environments using the `PyNcclPipe` KV cache transfer integration with the V0 engine. No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports the use of the\u00a0`PyNcclPipe`\u00a0class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the\u00a0`PyNcclCommunicator`\u00a0class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the\u00a0`send_obj`\u00a0and\u00a0`recv_obj`\u00a0methods on the CPU side.\u200b The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network. The default and intentional behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface listens on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface. As of version 0.8.5, vLLM limits the `TCPStore` socket to the private interface as configured.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47277", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/0d6e187e88874c39cda7409cf673f9e6546893e7", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-hjq4-87xh-g4fv", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/15988", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/deployment/security.html", "ref_desc": "Security Guide \u2014 vLLM", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
