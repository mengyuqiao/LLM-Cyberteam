{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48887", "Description": "vLLM, an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs), has a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the file `vllm/entrypoints/openai/tool_parsers/pythonic_tool_parser.py` of versions 0.6.4 up to but excluding 0.9.0. The root cause is the use of a highly complex and nested regular expression for tool call detection, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause severe performance degradation or make the service unavailable. The pattern contains multiple nested quantifiers, optional groups, and inner repetitions which make it vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. Version 0.9.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48887", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/18454", "ref_desc": "[Bugfix] Migrate to REGEX Library to prevent catastrophic backtracking by Crucifixion-Fxl \u00b7 Pull Request #18454 \u00b7 vllm-project/vllm \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-w6q7-j642-7c25", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/4fc1bf813ad80172c1db31264beaef7d93fe0601", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
