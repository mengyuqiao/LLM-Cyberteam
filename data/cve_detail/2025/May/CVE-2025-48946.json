{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48946", "Description": "liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms. liboqs prior to version 0.13.0 supports the HQC algorithm, an algorithm with a theoretical design flaw which leads to large numbers of malformed ciphertexts sharing the same implicit rejection value. Currently, no concrete attack on the algorithm is known. However, prospective users of HQC must take extra care when using the algorithm in protocols involving key derivation. In particular, HQC does not provide the same security guarantees as Kyber or ML-KEM. There is currently no patch for the HQC flaw available in liboqs, so HQC is disabled by default in liboqs starting from version 0.13.0. OQS will update its implementation after the HQC team releases an updated algorithm specification.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48946", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.02%  0.02%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://durumcrustulum.com/2024/02/24/how-to-hold-kems/#hqc", "ref_desc": "How to Hold KEMs", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-3rxw-4v8q-9gq5", "ref_desc": "Theoretical design flaw in HQC \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-quantum-safe/liboqs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/Wiu4ZQo3fP80", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/a7d698ca9c9d98990647459253183cbe29c550af", "ref_desc": "Temporarily disable HQC (#2122) \u00b7 open-quantum-safe/liboqs@a7d698c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
