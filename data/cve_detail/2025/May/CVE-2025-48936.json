{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48936", "Description": "Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2, a potential vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. This specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48936", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.2.2cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.70.12cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  from including (>=) 2.71.0andbefore (<) 2.71.11cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/c097887bc5f680e12c998580fb56d98a15758f53", "ref_desc": "fix: validate proto header and provide https enforcement (#9975) \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel@c097887 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-93m4-mfpg-c3xf", "ref_desc": "Account Takeover via Malicious X-Forwarded-Proto Header Injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
