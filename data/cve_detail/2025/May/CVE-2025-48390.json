{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48390", "Description": "FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.178, FreeScout is vulnerable to code injection due to insufficient validation of user input in the php_path parameter. The backticks characters are not removed, as well as tabulation is not removed. When checking user input, the file_exists function is also called to check for the presence of such a file (folder) in the file system. A user with the administrator role can create a translation for the language, which will create a folder in the file system. Further in tools.php, the user can specify the path to this folder as php_path, which will lead to the execution of code in backticks. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.178.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48390", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/commit/fb33d672a2d67f5a2b3cf69c80945267f17908b2", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-5324-cw55-gwj5", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 freescout-help-desk/freescout \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
