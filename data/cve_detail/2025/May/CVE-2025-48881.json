{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48881", "Description": "Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions starting from 11.0.0.RELEASE to 11.3.3.RELEASE and 12.0.0.RELEASE to 12.12.0.RELEASE, all objects for which an object-management configuration exists can be listed, viewed, edited, created or deleted by unauthorised users. If object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations. This issue has been patched in version 12.13.0.RELEASE.  A workaround for this issue involves overriding the endpoint security as defined in ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer and ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer. Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48881", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p", "ref_desc": "Objects in the object-api can be accesses and modified by unauthorised users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/commit/6ab04b30d3dab816bfea32d40ba50e5dd4517272", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
