{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47287", "Description": "Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. When Tornado's ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors, it logs a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs, constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the logging subsystem is synchronous. All versions of Tornado prior to 6.5.0 are affected. The vulnerable parser is enabled by default. Upgrade to Tornado version 6.50 to receive a patch. As a workaround, risk can be mitigated by blocking `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` in a proxy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47287", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-29  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-05-21  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/commit/b39b892bf78fe8fea01dd45199aa88307e7162f3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/security/advisories/GHSA-7cx3-6m66-7c5m", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00038.html", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
