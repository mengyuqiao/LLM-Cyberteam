{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48369", "Description": "Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool. Prior to versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20, a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Groupoffice's tasks comment functionality, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript by uploading an file with a crafted filename. When administrators or other users view the task containing this malicious file, the payload executes in their browser context. The application fails to sanitize image filenames before rendering them in the comment. By uploading an image with a crafted filename containing XSS payloads, attackers can steal sensitive information. Versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20 contain a fix for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48369", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nIntermesh\u00bbGroup-officeVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.1andbefore (<) 25.0.20cpe:2.3:a:intermesh:group-office:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIntermesh\u00bbGroup-officeVersions  before (<) 6.8.199cpe:2.3:a:intermesh:group-office:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-30  0.06%  0.03%  -0.03 \n 2  2025-05-28  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-45jj-r48j-75pp", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in Tasks Comment Section \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Intermesh/groupoffice \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
