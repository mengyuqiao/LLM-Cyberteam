{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48372", "Description": "Schule is open-source school management system software. The generateOTP() function generates a 4-digit numeric One-Time Password (OTP). Prior to version 1.0.1, even if a secure random number generator is used, the short length and limited range (1000\u20139999) results in only 9000 possible combinations. This small keyspace makes the OTP highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, especially in the absence of strong rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms. Version 1.0.1 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48372", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/schule111/Schule/security/advisories/GHSA-6c48-67xx-vqgc", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/schule111/Schule/commit/cd53abbea93943f2c60a5281d45bebadc57636b7", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
