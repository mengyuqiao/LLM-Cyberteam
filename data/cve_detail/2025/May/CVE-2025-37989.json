{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-37989", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: leds: fix memory leak\n\nA network restart test on a router led to an out-of-memory condition,\nwhich was traced to a memory leak in the PHY LED trigger code.\n\nThe root cause is misuse of the devm API. The registration function\n(phy_led_triggers_register) is called from phy_attach_direct, not\nphy_probe, and the unregister function (phy_led_triggers_unregister)\nis called from phy_detach, not phy_remove. This means the register and\nunregister functions can be called multiple times for the same PHY\ndevice, but devm-allocated memory is not freed until the driver is\nunbound.\n\nThis also prevents kmemleak from detecting the leak, as the devm API\ninternally stores the allocated pointer.\n\nFix this by replacing devm_kzalloc/devm_kcalloc with standard\nkzalloc/kcalloc, and add the corresponding kfree calls in the unregister\npath.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37989", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/95bed65cc0eb2a610550abf849a8b94374da80a7", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b7f0ee992adf601aa00c252418266177eb7ac2bc", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7f3d5880800f962c347777c4f8358f29f5fc403c", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/966d6494e2ed9be9052fcd9815afba830896aaf8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/41143e71052a00d654c15dc924fda50c1e7357d0", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/663c3da86e807c6c07ed48f911c7526fad6fe1ff", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f41f097f68a33d392579885426d0734a81219501", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/618541a6cc1511064dfa58c89b3445e21844092f", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
