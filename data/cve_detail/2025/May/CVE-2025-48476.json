{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48476", "Description": "FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.180, when adding and editing user records using the fill() method, there is no check for the absence of the password field in the data coming from the user, which leads to a mass-assignment vulnerability. As a result, a user with the right to edit other users of the system can change their password, and then log in to the system using the set password. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48476", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFreescout\u00bbFreescoutVersions  before (<) 1.8.180cpe:2.3:a:freescout:freescout:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-841 Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/841/Improper-Enforcement-of-Behavioral-Workflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-7h5m-q39p-h849", "ref_desc": "Business Logic Errors [1] \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 freescout-help-desk/freescout \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
