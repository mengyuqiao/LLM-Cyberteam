{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46191", "Description": "Arbitrary File Upload in user_payment_update.php in SourceCodester Client Database Management System 1.0 allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files via the uploaded_file_cancelled field. Due to the absence of proper file extension checks, MIME type validation, and authentication, attackers can upload executable PHP files to a web-accessible directory (/files/). This allows them to execute arbitrary commands remotely by accessing the uploaded script, resulting in full Remote Code Execution (RCE) without authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46191", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nLerouxyxchire\u00bbClient Database Management System\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:lerouxyxchire:client_database_management_system:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-03  0.12%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2025-05-23  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-05-15  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/x6vrn/mitre/blob/main/CVE-2025-46191.md", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload", "ref_desc": "File uploads | Web Security AcademyTechnical DescriptionCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rPhPtBdYmg1lJiNQL3H-fWWEvI4.html"}]}
