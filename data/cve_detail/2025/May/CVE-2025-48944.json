{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48944", "Description": "vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). In version 0.8.0 up to but excluding 0.9.0, the vLLM backend used with the /v1/chat/completions OpenAPI endpoint fails to validate unexpected or malformed input in the \"pattern\" and \"type\" fields when the tools functionality is invoked. These inputs are not validated before being compiled or parsed, causing a crash of the inference worker with a single request. The worker will remain down until it is restarted. Version 0.9.0 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48944", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/17623", "ref_desc": "[Bugfix] validate grammar and throw 400 error instead of crashing the engine when xgrammar validation fails by Jason-CKY \u00b7 Pull Request #17623 \u00b7 vllm-project/vllm \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AjJjklh6Cpcn5nObpc1n8jT9LE4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-vrq3-r879-7m65", "ref_desc": "DoS via Malformed pattern and type Fields in vLLM Tool Schema \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vllm-project/vllm \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
