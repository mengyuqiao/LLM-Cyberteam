{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47275", "Description": "Auth0-PHP provides the PHP SDK for Auth0 Authentication and Management APIs. Starting in version 8.0.0-BETA1 and prior to version 8.14.0, session cookies of applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced, which may result in unauthorized access. Certain pre-conditions are required to be vulnerable to this issue: Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK, or the Auth0/symfony, Auth0/laravel-auth0, and Auth0/wordpress SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK; and session storage configured with CookieStore. Upgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to v8.14.0 to receive a patch. As an additional precautionary measure, rotating cookie encryption keys is recommended. Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47275", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-21  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/commit/52a79480fdb246f59dbc089b81a784ae049bd389", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_MB53-bSHWlkkmKY3qpfoWWQdS0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/security/advisories/GHSA-g98g-r7gf-2r25", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-9wg9-93h9-j8ch", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-9fwj-9mjf-rhj3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/security/advisories/GHSA-2f4r-34m4-3w8q", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/releases/tag/8.14.0", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
