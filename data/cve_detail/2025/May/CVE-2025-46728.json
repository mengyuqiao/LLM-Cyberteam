{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46728", "Description": "cpp-httplib is a C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library. Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46728", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-07  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-05-12  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/commit/7b752106ac42bd5b907793950d9125a0972c8e8e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/security/advisories/GHSA-px83-72rx-v57c", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
