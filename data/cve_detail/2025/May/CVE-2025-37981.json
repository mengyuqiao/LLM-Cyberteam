{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-37981", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: smartpqi: Use is_kdump_kernel() to check for kdump\n\nThe smartpqi driver checks the reset_devices variable to determine\nwhether special adjustments need to be made for kdump. This has the\neffect that after a regular kexec reboot, some driver parameters such as\nmax_transfer_size are much lower than usual. More importantly, kexec\nreboot tests have revealed memory corruption caused by the driver log\nbeing written to system memory after a kexec.\n\nFix this by testing is_kdump_kernel() rather than reset_devices where\nappropriate.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37981", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.02%  0.02%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebf673c76ce91e612a882dfaa9a3824962994aae", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2d5a0072235a69749ceb04c1a26dc75df66a31a", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7cc670e8ebaa5241dd99c0ad75eceb8f8f64f607", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
