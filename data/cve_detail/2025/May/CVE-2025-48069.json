{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48069", "Description": "ejson2env allows users to decrypt EJSON secrets and export them as environment variables. Prior to version 2.0.8, the `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. Version 2.0.8 sanitizes output during decryption. Other mitigations involve avoiding use of `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets and/or avoiding evaluating or executing the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48069", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-27  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Shopify/ejson2env/commit/592b3ceea967fee8b064e70983e8cec087b6d840", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Shopify/ejson2env/security/advisories/GHSA-2c47-m757-32g6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
