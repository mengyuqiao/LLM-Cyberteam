{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46336", "Description": "Rack::Session is a session management implementation for Rack. In versions starting from 2.0.0 to before 2.1.1, when using the Rack::Session::Pool middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46336", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  0.02%  0.03%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-vpfw-47h7-xj4g", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/14bVW03EB6UNsp96EfIuBB5oxRo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack-session/commit/c28c4a8c1861d814e09f2ae48264ac4c40be2d3b", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack-session/security/advisories/GHSA-9j94-67jr-4cqj", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
