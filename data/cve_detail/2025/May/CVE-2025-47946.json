{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47946", "Description": "Symfony UX is an initiative and set of libraries to integrate JavaScript tools into applications. Prior to version 2.25.1, rendering `{{ attributes }}` or using any method that returns a `ComponentAttributes` instance (e.g. `only()`, `defaults()`, `without()`) ouputs attribute values directly without escaping. If these values are unsafe (e.g. contain user input), this can lead to HTML attribute injection and XSS vulnerabilities. The issue is fixed in version `2.25.1` of `symfony/ux-twig-component` Those who use `symfony/ux-live-component` must also update it to `2.25.1` to benefit from the fix, as it reuses the `ComponentAttributes` class internally. As a workaround, avoid rendering `{{ attributes }}` or derived objects directly if it may contain untrusted values.\nInstead, use `{{ attributes.render('name') }}` for safe output of individual attributes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47946", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-25  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/ux/commit/b5d1c85995c128cb926d47a96cfbfbd500b643a8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/ux/security/advisories/GHSA-5j3w-5pcr-f8hg", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
