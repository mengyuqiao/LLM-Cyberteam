{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46332", "Description": "Flags SDK is an open-source feature flags toolkit for Next.js and SvelteKit. Impacted versions include flags from 3.2.0 and prior and @vercel/flags from 3.1.1 and prior as certain circumstances allows a bad actor with detailed knowledge of the vulnerability to list all flags returned by the flags discovery endpoint (.well-known/vercel/flags). This vulnerability allows for information disclosure, where a bad actor could gain access to a list of all feature flags exposed through the flags discovery endpoint, including the flag names, flag descriptions, available options and their labels (e.g. true, false), and default flag values. This issue has been patched in flags@4.0.0, users of flags and @vercel/flags should also migrate to flags@4.0.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46332", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-03  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-05-08  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://vercel.com/changelog/information-disclosure-in-flags-sdk-cve-2025-46332", "ref_desc": "Information disclosure in Flags SDK (CVE-2025-46332) - Vercel", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/flags/blob/main/packages/flags/guides/upgrade-to-v4.md", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/flags/security/advisories/GHSA-892p-pqrr-hxqr", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
