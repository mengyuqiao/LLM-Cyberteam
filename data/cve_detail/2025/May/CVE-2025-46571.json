{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46571", "Description": "Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Prior to version 0.6.6, low privileged users can upload HTML files which contain JavaScript code via the `/api/v1/files/` backend endpoint. This endpoint returns a file id, which can be used to open the file in the browser and trigger the JavaScript code in the user's browser. Under the default settings, files uploaded by low-privileged users can only be viewed by admins or themselves, limiting the impact of this vulnerability. A link to such a file can be sent to an admin, and if clicked, will give the low-privileged user complete control over the admin's account, ultimately enabling RCE via functions. Version 0.6.6 contains a fix for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46571", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/blob/main/backend/open_webui/routers/files.py#L434-L438", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/ef2aeb7c0eb976bac759e59ac359c94a5b8dc7e0", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/security/advisories/GHSA-8gh5-qqh8-hq3x", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
