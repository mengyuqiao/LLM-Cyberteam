{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48889", "Description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows quick building of demos and web application for machine learning models, API, or any arbitrary Python function. Prior to version 5.31.0, an arbitrary file copy vulnerability in Gradio's flagging feature allows unauthenticated attackers to copy any readable file from the server's filesystem. While attackers can't read these copied files, they can cause DoS by copying large files (like /dev/urandom) to fill disk space. This issue has been patched in version 5.31.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48889", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-8jw3-6x8j-v96g", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized File Copy via Path Manipulation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
