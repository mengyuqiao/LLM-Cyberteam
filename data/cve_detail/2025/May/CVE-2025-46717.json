{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46717", "Description": "sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version 0.2.6, users with no (or very limited) sudo privileges can determine whether files exists in folders that they otherwise cannot access using `sudo --list <pathname>`. Users with local access to a machine can discover the existence/non-existence of certain files, revealing potentially sensitive information in the file names. This information can also be used in conjunction with other attacks. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46717", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 1 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/497/Exposure-of-Sensitive-System-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-98cv-wqjx-wx8f", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/releases/tag/v0.2.6", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MOp8j5sxaLee8MMuT8yn_F6Z0zM.html"}]}
