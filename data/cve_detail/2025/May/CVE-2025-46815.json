{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46815", "Description": "The identity infrastructure software ZITADEL offers developers the ability to manage user sessions using the Session API. This API enables the use of IdPs for authentication, known as idp intents. Following a successful idp intent, the client receives an id and token on a predefined URI. These id and token can then be used to authenticate the user or their session. However, prior to versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10, it was possible to exploit this feature by repeatedly using intents. This allowed an attacker with access to the application\u2019s URI to retrieve the id and token, enabling them to authenticate on behalf of the user. It's important to note that the use of additional factors (MFA) prevents a complete authentication process and, consequently, access to the ZITADEL API. Versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10 contain a fix for the issue. No known workarounds other than upgrading are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46815", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-31  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-05-12  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.71.9", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.70.10", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.0.0", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/b1e60e7398d677f08b06fd7715227f70b7ca1162", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-g4r8-mp7g-85fq", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
