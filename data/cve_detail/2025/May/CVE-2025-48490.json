{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48490", "Description": "Laravel Rest Api is an API generator. Prior to version 2.13.0, a validation bypass vulnerability was discovered where multiple validations defined for the same attribute could be silently overridden. Due to how the framework merged validation rules across multiple contexts (such as index, store, and update actions), malicious actors could exploit this behavior by crafting requests that bypass expected validation rules, potentially injecting unexpected or dangerous parameters into the application. This could lead to unauthorized data being accepted or processed by the API, depending on the context in which the validation was bypassed. This issue has been patched in version 2.13.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48490", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1173 Improper Use of Validation Framework", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1173/Improper-Use-of-Validation-Framework.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Lomkit/laravel-rest-api/pull/172", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Lomkit/laravel-rest-api/security/advisories/GHSA-69rh-hccr-cxrj", "ref_desc": "Search Validation Bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Lomkit/laravel-rest-api \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Lomkit/laravel-rest-api/commit/88b14587b4efd7e59d7379658c606d325bb513b4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
