{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-31590", "Description": "PwnDoc all versions until 0.4.0 (2021-08-23) has incorrect JSON Webtoken handling, leading to incorrect access control. With a valid JSON Webtoken that is used for authentication and authorization, a user can keep his admin privileges even if he is downgraded to the \"user\" privilege. Even after a user's account is deleted, the user can still access the administration panel (and add or delete users) and has complete access to the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31590", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPwndoc Project\u00bbPwndocVersions  before (<) 0.4.0cpe:2.3:a:pwndoc_project:pwndoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  2.65%  1.49%  -1.16 \n 2  2025-03-29  1.49%  2.65%  +1.16 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.78%  1.49%  +0.71 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.78%  +0.37 \n 5  2023-10-11  0.32%  0.42%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-03-10  0.28%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.28%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/pull/128", "ref_desc": "Applied fix for CVE-2021-31590 by Lednerb \u00b7 Pull Request #128 \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/security/advisories", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/pull/74", "ref_desc": "Security Update: Change JWT Secret and TLS Certificate automatically on build by Lednerb \u00b7 Pull Request #74 \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/commit/ff1b868cec55f5b6c7a91e15a2b0b1f4324121ab", "ref_desc": "Update Session management using refresh token \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc@ff1b868 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.dgc.org/responsible_disclosure_pwndoc_jwt", "ref_desc": "DGC | Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Cybersicherheit | PwnDoc - Incorrect Access Control VulnerabilityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/commit/15f3dc0e212eda465e05fda0feb002d1bce2939d", "ref_desc": "Update JWT generation \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc@15f3dc0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/blob/59519735b0d831d8fd96d7c3387f66d28407e583/CHANGELOG.md#040-2021-08-23", "ref_desc": "pwndoc/CHANGELOG.md at 59519735b0d831d8fd96d7c3387f66d28407e583 \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
