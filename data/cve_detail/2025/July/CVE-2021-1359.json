{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1359", "Description": "A vulnerability in the configuration management of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection and elevate privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied XML input for the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading crafted XML configuration files that contain scripting code to a vulnerable device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root. An attacker would need a valid user account with the rights to upload configuration files to exploit this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1359", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 12.5.0andbefore (<) 12.5.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 11.8.0andbefore (<) 12.0.3-005cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:11.8.0-429cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:11.8.0-429:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:11.8.0-453cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:11.8.0-453:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  3.80%  0.93%  -2.87 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.93%  3.80%  +2.87 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.44%  0.93%  +0.49 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.44%  +0.33 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.10%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-112 Missing XML Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/112/Missing-XML-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-scr-web-priv-esc-k3HCGJZ", "ref_desc": "Cisco Web Security Appliance Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
