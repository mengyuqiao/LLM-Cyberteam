{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28674", "Description": "The node management page in SolarWinds Orion Platform before 2020.2.5 HF1 allows an attacker to create or delete a node (outside of the attacker's perimeter) via an account with write permissions. This occurs because node IDs are predictable (with incrementing numbers) and the access control on Services/NodeManagement.asmx/DeleteObjNow is incorrect. To exploit this, an attacker must be authenticated and must have node management rights associated with at least one valid group on the platform.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28674", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolarwinds\u00bbOrion PlatformVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2020.2.5cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:orion_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.32%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.37%  0.32%  -0.05 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.31%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.31%  +0.22 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pastebin.com/zFUd2cCj", "ref_desc": "CVEDetails - Pastebin.comThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-28674", "ref_desc": "SolarWinds Trust Center Security Advisories | CVE-2021-28674Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
