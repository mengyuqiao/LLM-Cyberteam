{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34332", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2). The BMP_Loader.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing BMP files. A malformed input file could result in an infinite loop condition that leads to denial of service condition. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to consume excessive resources.
