{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32743", "Description": "Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for reporting. In versions prior to 2.11.10 and from version 2.12.0 through version 2.12.4, some of the Icinga 2 features that require credentials for external services expose those credentials through the API to authenticated API users with read permissions for the corresponding object types. IdoMysqlConnection and IdoPgsqlConnection (every released version) exposes the password of the user used to connect to the database. IcingaDB (added in 2.12.0) exposes the password used to connect to the Redis server. ElasticsearchWriter (added in 2.8.0)exposes the password used to connect to the Elasticsearch server. An attacker who obtains these credentials can impersonate Icinga to these services and add, modify and delete information there. If credentials with more permissions are in use, this increases the impact accordingly. Starting with the 2.11.10 and 2.12.5 releases, these passwords are no longer exposed via the API. As a workaround, API user permissions can be restricted to not allow querying of any affected objects, either by explicitly listing only the required object types for object query permissions, or by applying a filter rule.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32743", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 2.12.0andbefore (<) 2.12.5cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.11.10cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.74% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-06  0.62%  0.74%  +0.12 \n 2  2025-04-27  0.46%  0.62%  +0.16 \n 3  2025-04-14  0.47%  0.46%  -0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.90%  0.47%  -0.44 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.47%  0.90%  +0.44 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.40%  0.47%  +0.07 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.65%  0.40%  -0.25 \n 8  2024-11-17  0.64%  0.65%  +0.01 \n 9  2024-08-01  0.45%  0.64%  +0.19 \n 10  2024-07-18  0.32%  0.45%  +0.13 \n 11  2024-06-06  0.33%  0.32%  -0.01 \n 12  2023-10-07  0.27%  0.33%  +0.05 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.27%  -0.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-202 Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/202/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-Through-Data-Queries.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/security/advisories/GHSA-wrpw-pmr8-qgj7", "ref_desc": "Passwords used to access external services inadvertently exposed through API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Icinga/icinga2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://icinga.com/blog/2021/07/15/releasing-icinga-2-12-5-and-2-11-10/", "ref_desc": "Icinga 2.12.5 + 2.11.10: Security ReleasesExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/11/msg00010.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2816-1] icinga2 security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lKImfY1caokQKVljww_4rbTB-Hk.html"}]}
