{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1518", "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) On-Box Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user input on specific REST API commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the API subsystem of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid low-privileged user credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1518", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Device Manager On-boxVersions  from including (>=) 6.5.0andbefore (<) 6.7.0.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_device_manager_on-box:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Device Manager On-boxVersions  from including (>=) 6.3.0andbefore (<) 6.4.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_device_manager_on-box:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.69% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.82%  0.69%  -1.13 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.69%  1.82%  +1.13 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.26%  0.69%  +0.43 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.22%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-10-15  0.16%  0.22%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-07-07  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.15%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fdm-rce-Rx6vVurq", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Device Manager On-Box Software Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
