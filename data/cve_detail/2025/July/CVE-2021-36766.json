{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36766", "Description": "Concrete5 through 8.5.5 deserializes Untrusted Data. The vulnerable code is located within the controllers/single_page/dashboard/system/environment/logging.php Logging::update_logging() method. User input passed through the logFile request parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a call to the file_exists() PHP function. This can be exploited by malicious users to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope (PHP Object Injection via phar:// stream wrapper), allowing them to carry out a variety of attacks, such as executing arbitrary PHP code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36766", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nConcretecms\u00bbConcrete CmsVersions  before (<) 8.5.6cpe:2.3:a:concretecms:concrete_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  1.44%  1.54%  +0.10 \n 2  2025-06-01  1.54%  1.44%  -0.10 \n 3  2025-05-04  1.44%  1.54%  +0.10 \n 4  2025-05-01  1.54%  1.44%  -0.10 \n 5  2025-04-13  1.44%  1.54%  +0.10 \n 6  2025-04-12  1.54%  1.44%  -0.10 \n 7  2025-04-04  1.44%  1.54%  +0.10 \n 8  2025-04-03  1.54%  1.44%  -0.10 \n 9  2025-04-02  1.44%  1.54%  +0.10 \n 10  2025-04-01  1.54%  1.44%  -0.10 \n 11  2025-03-30  2.95%  1.54%  -1.41 \n 12  2025-03-29  1.54%  2.95%  +1.41 \n 13  2025-03-28  1.44%  1.54%  +0.10 \n 14  2025-03-26  1.54%  1.44%  -0.10 \n 15  2025-03-20  1.65%  1.54%  -0.11 \n 16  2025-03-17  1.03%  1.65%  +0.62 \n 17  2024-12-30  0.99%  1.03%  +0.04 \n 18  2024-12-17  3.70%  0.99%  -2.72 \n 19  2024-11-29  3.67%  3.70%  +0.03 \n 20  2024-10-13  2.63%  3.67%  +1.05 \n 21  2024-08-29  1.89%  2.63%  +0.74 \n 22  2024-07-30  1.34%  1.89%  +0.55 \n 23  2024-06-18  0.97%  1.34%  +0.37 \n 24  2024-02-19  0.69%  0.97%  +0.29 \n 25  2023-08-10  0.24%  0.69%  +0.45 \n 26  2023-03-18  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 27  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1063039", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163564/Concrete5-8.5.5-Phar-Deserialization.html", "ref_desc": "Concrete5 8.5.5 Phar Deserialization \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Jul/36", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [KIS-2021-05] Concrete5 <= 8.5.5 (Logging Settings) Phar Deserialization VulnerabilityExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
