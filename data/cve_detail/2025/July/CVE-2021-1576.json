{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1576", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Business Process Automation (BPA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator. These vulnerabilities are due to improper authorization enforcement for specific features and for access to log files that contain confidential information. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities either by submitting crafted HTTP messages to an affected system and performing unauthorized actions with the privileges of an administrator, or by retrieving sensitive data from the logs and using it to impersonate a legitimate privileged user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1576", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbBusiness Process AutomationVersions  before (<) 3.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:business_process_automation:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.44%  0.26%  -0.19 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.26%  0.44%  +0.19 \n 3  2025-03-25  0.20%  0.26%  +0.06 \n 4  2025-03-20  0.20%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.23%  0.20%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-10-01  0.23%  0.23%  0.00 \n 7  2023-06-23  0.16%  0.23%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bpa-priv-esc-dgubwbH4", "ref_desc": "Cisco Business Process Automation Privilege Escalation VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/thQaXMygdciCENhzFcbaDNK21Ig.html"}]}
