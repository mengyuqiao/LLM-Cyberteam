{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-35464", "Description": "ForgeRock AM server before 7.0 has a Java deserialization vulnerability in the jato.pageSession parameter on multiple pages. The exploitation does not require authentication, and remote code execution can be triggered by sending a single crafted /ccversion/* request to the server. The vulnerability exists due to the usage of Sun ONE Application Framework (JATO) found in versions of Java 8 or earlier", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35464", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nForgerock\u00bbOpenamVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 14.6.3cpe:2.3:a:forgerock:openam:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nForgerock\u00bbAccess ManagementVersions  before (<) 6.5.4cpe:2.3:a:forgerock:access_management:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "94.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-16  94.43%  94.39%  -0.04 \n 2  2025-05-15  94.38%  94.43%  +0.05 \n 3  2025-05-05  94.42%  94.38%  -0.04 \n 4  2025-05-03  94.38%  94.42%  +0.04 \n 5  2025-04-08  94.37%  94.38%  +0.02 \n 6  2025-03-30  94.39%  94.37%  -0.02 \n 7  2025-03-29  94.37%  94.39%  +0.02 \n 8  2025-03-27  94.34%  94.37%  +0.02 \n 9  2025-03-26  94.31%  94.34%  +0.03 \n 10  2025-03-24  94.34%  94.31%  -0.03 \n 11  2025-03-23  94.31%  94.34%  +0.04 \n 12  2025-03-18  94.34%  94.31%  -0.03 \n 13  2025-03-17  97.50%  94.34%  -3.16 \n 14  2025-03-05  97.49%  97.50%  +0.01 \n 15  2025-02-16  97.48%  97.49%  +0.01 \n 16  2025-01-29  97.46%  97.48%  +0.02 \n 17  2025-01-11  97.46%  97.46%  0.00 \n 18  2024-12-17  97.33%  97.46%  +0.14 \n 19  2024-12-09  97.42%  97.33%  -0.10 \n 20  2024-11-24  97.40%  97.42%  +0.02 \n 21  2024-11-07  97.35%  97.40%  +0.05 \n 22  2024-09-22  97.35%  97.35%  +0.01 \n 23  2024-07-25  97.40%  97.35%  -0.05 \n 24  2024-04-06  97.44%  97.40%  -0.04 \n 25  2024-02-26  97.36%  97.44%  +0.08 \n 26  2024-02-07  97.32%  97.36%  +0.04 \n 27  2024-01-31  97.26%  97.32%  +0.05 \n 28  2024-01-18  97.36%  97.26%  -0.10 \n 29  2024-01-04  97.38%  97.36%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/kb/article/a47894244", "ref_desc": "AM Security Advisory #202104 - Knowledge - BackStageExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163525/ForgeRock-Access-Manager-OpenAM-14.6.3-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "ForgeRock Access Manager/OpenAM 14.6.3 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugster.forgerock.org", "ref_desc": "System Dashboard - ForgeRock JIRABroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163486/ForgeRock-OpenAM-Jato-Java-Deserialization.html", "ref_desc": "ForgeRock / OpenAM Jato Java Deserialization \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
