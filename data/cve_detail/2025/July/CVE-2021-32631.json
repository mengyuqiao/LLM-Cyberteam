{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32631", "Description": "Common is a package of common modules that can be accessed by NIMBLE services. Common before commit number 3b96cb0293d3443b870351945f41d7d55cb34b53 did not properly verify the signature of JSON Web Tokens. This allows someone to forge a valid JWT. Being able to forge JWTs may lead to authentication bypasses. Commit number 3b96cb0293d3443b870351945f41d7d55cb34b53 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may use the parseClaimsJws method to correctly verify the signature of a JWT.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32631", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNimble-project\u00bbCommon\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:nimble-project:common:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.30%  0.25%  -0.05 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.25%  0.30%  +0.05 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.25%  +0.15 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nimble-platform/common/security/advisories/GHSA-fjq8-896w-pv28", "ref_desc": "JSON Web Tokens not properly verified \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nimble-platform/common \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nimble-platform/common/commit/a59ad46733912a5580530e39cac0e6ebc83cc563", "ref_desc": "Use parseClaimsJws method instead of parseJws \u00b7 nimble-platform/common@a59ad46 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nimble-platform/common/commit/3b96cb0293d3443b870351945f41d7d55cb34b53", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #81 from nimble-platform/staging \u00b7 nimble-platform/common@3b96cb0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nimble-platform/common/commit/12197a755bd524559bf4e16475595a2c6fcd34db", "ref_desc": "Fixed JWT validation according to https://github.com/nimble-platform/\u2026 \u00b7 nimble-platform/common@12197a7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
