{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32750", "Description": "MuWire is a file publishing and networking tool that protects the identity of its users by using I2P technology. Users of MuWire desktop client prior to version 0.8.8 can be de-anonymized by an attacker who knows their full ID. An attacker could send a message with a subject line containing a URL with an HTML image tag and the MuWire client would try to fetch that image via clearnet, thus exposing the IP address of the user. The problem is fixed in MuWire 0.8.8. As a workaround, users can disable messaging functionality to prevent other users from sending them malicious messages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32750", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMuwire Project\u00bbMuwireVersions  before (<) 0.8.8cpe:2.3:a:muwire_project:muwire:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.54%  0.28%  -0.26 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.28%  0.54%  +0.26 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.28%  +0.17 \n 4  2025-02-26  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-11-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zlatinb/muwire/security/advisories/GHSA-68xh-9h7w-64qg", "ref_desc": "De-anonymization via message \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zlatinb/muwire \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
