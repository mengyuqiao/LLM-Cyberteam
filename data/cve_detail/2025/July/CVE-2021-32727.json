{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32727", "Description": "Nextcloud Android Client is the Android client for Nextcloud. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1. As a workaround, do not add additional end-to-end encrypted devices to a user account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32727", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 3.16.1cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.33%  0.17%  -0.16 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.17%  0.33%  +0.16 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.20%  0.17%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-03-27  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-16  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 7  2024-01-21  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-5v33-r9cm-7736", "ref_desc": "End-to-end encryption device setup did not verify public key \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/android/pull/8438", "ref_desc": "check e2e keys by tobiasKaminsky \u00b7 Pull Request #8438 \u00b7 nextcloud/android \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/end_to_end_encryption_rfc/blob/7f002996397faefb664019a97ebb0a1e210f64f0/RFC.md#further-devices", "ref_desc": "end_to_end_encryption_rfc/RFC.md at 7f002996397faefb664019a97ebb0a1e210f64f0 \u00b7 nextcloud/end_to_end_encryption_rfc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1189162", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions RequiredCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QCX4HqU5hP3f3KjKjmkViDIbN4s.html"}]}
