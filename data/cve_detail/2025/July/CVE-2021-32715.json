{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32715", "Description": "hyper is an HTTP library for rust. hyper's HTTP/1 server code had a flaw that incorrectly parses and accepts requests with a `Content-Length` header with a prefixed plus sign, when it should have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that doesn't parse such `Content-Length` headers, but forwards them, can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\". The flaw exists in all prior versions of hyper prior to 0.14.10, if built with `rustc` v1.5.0 or newer. The vulnerability is patched in hyper version 0.14.10. Two workarounds exist: One may reject requests manually that contain a plus sign prefix in the `Content-Length` header or ensure any upstream proxy handles `Content-Length` headers with a plus sign prefix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32715", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHyper\u00bbHyper\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.14.10cpe:2.3:a:hyper:hyper:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.43%  0.30%  -0.13 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.30%  0.43%  +0.13 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.32%  0.30%  -0.02 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.32%  +0.23 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-03-22  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-02-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/security/advisories/GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c", "ref_desc": "Lenient Parsing of Content-Length Header When Prefixed with Plus Sign \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hyperium/hyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/28826/commits/123a83326fb95366e94a3be1a74775df4db97739", "ref_desc": "Integer parsing should accept leading plus by arthurprs \u00b7 Pull Request #28826 \u00b7 rust-lang/rust \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
