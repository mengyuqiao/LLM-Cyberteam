{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32738", "Description": "js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32738", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nStellar\u00bbJs-stellar-sdk\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 8.2.3cpe:2.3:a:stellar:js-stellar-sdk:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/releases/tag/v8.2.3", "ref_desc": "Release v8.2.3 \u00b7 stellar/js-stellar-sdk \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6cgh-hjpw-q3gq", "ref_desc": "Utils.readChallengeTx does not verify the server account signature \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 stellar/js-stellar-sdk \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
