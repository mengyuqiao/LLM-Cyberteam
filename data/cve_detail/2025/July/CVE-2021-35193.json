{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-35193", "Description": "Patterson Application Service in Patterson Eaglesoft 18 through 21 accepts the same certificate authentication across different customers' installations (that have the same software version). This provides remote access to SQL database credentials. (In the normal use of the product, retrieving those credentials only occurs after a username/password authentication step; however, this authentication step is on the client side, and an attacker can develop their own client that skips this step.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35193", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPattersondental\u00bbEaglesoftVersions  from including (>=) 18.0andup to, including, (<=) 21.0cpe:2.3:a:pattersondental:eaglesoft:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.32%  0.17%  -0.16 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.17%  0.32%  +0.16 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.37%  0.17%  -0.21 \n 4  2025-03-13  0.31%  0.37%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-12-02  0.22%  0.27%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-06-21  0.22%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 8  2024-04-14  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 9  2024-03-05  0.17%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-10-22  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://justinshafer.blogspot.com/2021/07/eaglesoft-18-through-21-vulnerability.html", "ref_desc": "Eaglesoft 18 through 21 vulnerability | Justin ShaferExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jshafer817/Eaglesoft", "ref_desc": "GitHub - jshafer817/Eaglesoft: Eaglesoft 21 POCExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://patterson.eaglesoft.net/Home/Contact-Us", "ref_desc": "Eaglesoft.net - Contact UsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
