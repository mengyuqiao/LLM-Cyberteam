{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1575", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1575", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbVirtualized Voice BrowserVersions  before (<) 12.6\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:virtualized_voice_browser:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.50%  0.32%  -0.17 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.32%  0.50%  +0.17 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.22%  0.32%  +0.10 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.15%  0.22%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-07-10  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-03-22  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-02-11  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vvb-xss-wG4zXRp3", "ref_desc": "Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
