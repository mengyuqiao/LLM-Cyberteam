{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24452", "Description": "The W3 Total Cache WordPress plugin before 2.1.5 was affected by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the \"extension\" parameter in the Extensions dashboard, when the 'Anonymously track usage to improve product quality' setting is enabled, as the parameter is output in a JavaScript context without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker, who can convince an authenticated admin into clicking a link, to run malicious JavaScript within the user's web browser, which could lead to full site compromise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24452", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBoldgrid\u00bbW3 Total Cache\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.1.5cpe:2.3:a:boldgrid:w3_total_cache:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "9.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-20  9.77%  9.63%  -0.15 \n 2  2025-03-30  44.59%  9.77%  -34.81 \n 3  2025-03-29  9.77%  44.59%  +34.81 \n 4  2025-03-24  25.93%  9.77%  -16.16 \n 5  2025-03-23  6.87%  25.93%  +19.07 \n 6  2025-03-18  7.18%  6.87%  -0.32 \n 7  2025-03-17  0.11%  7.18%  +7.07 \n 8  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 9  2024-04-03  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-20  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/3e855e09-056f-45b5-89a9-d644b7d8c9d0", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
