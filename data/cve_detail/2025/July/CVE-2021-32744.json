{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32744", "Description": "Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite. In versions prior to 4.2.17-1 and version 6.4.9-5, unauthenticated attackers are able to gain access to files which are currently opened by other users in the Collabora Online editor. For successful exploitation the attacker is required to guess the file identifier - the predictability of this file identifier is dependent on external file-storage implementations (this is a potential \"IDOR\" - Insecure Direct Object Reference - vulnerability). Versions 4.2.17-1 and 6.4.9-5 contain patches for this issue. There is no known workaround except updating the Collabora Online application to one of the patched releases.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32744", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCollabora\u00bbOnlineVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.0andbefore (<) 6.4.9-5cpe:2.3:a:collabora:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCollabora\u00bbOnlineVersions  before (<) 4.2.17-1cpe:2.3:a:collabora:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.75% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-01  0.57%  0.75%  +0.18 \n 2  2025-03-30  1.10%  0.57%  -0.53 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.57%  1.10%  +0.53 \n 4  2025-03-20  0.42%  0.57%  +0.15 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.14%  0.42%  +0.28 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 7  2024-04-05  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-02-25  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/security/advisories/GHSA-32xj-9x82-q9jw", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-32744: Unauthenticated attacker could gain access to currently open files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CollaboraOnline/online \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
