{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32742", "Description": "Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In versions 4.47.1 and prior, bug in the `Data.init(base32Encoded:)` function opens up the potential for exposing server memory and/or crashing the server (Denial of Service) for applications where untrusted data can end up in said function. Vapor does not currently use this function itself so this only impact applications that use the impacted function directly or through other dependencies. The vulnerability is patched in version 4.47.2. As a workaround, one may use an alternative to Vapor's built-in `Data.init(base32Encoded:)`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32742", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nVapor Project\u00bbVapor\u00bbForSwiftVersions  before (<) 4.47.2cpe:2.3:a:vapor_project:vapor:*:*:*:*:*:swift:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.73%  0.37%  -0.35 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.37%  0.73%  +0.35 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.18%  0.37%  +0.20 \n 4  2024-03-24  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-13  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vapor/vapor/releases/tag/4.47.2", "ref_desc": "Release Guard against invalid base32 encoded data \u00b7 vapor/vapor \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vapor/vapor/security/advisories/GHSA-pqwh-c2f3-vxmq", "ref_desc": "Untrusted data fed into `Data.init(base32Encoded:)` can result in exposing server memory and/or crash \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vapor/vapor \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
