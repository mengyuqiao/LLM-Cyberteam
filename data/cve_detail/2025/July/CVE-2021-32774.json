{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32774", "Description": "DataDump is a MediaWiki extension that provides dumps of wikis. Prior to commit 67a82b76e186925330b89ace9c5fd893a300830b, DataDump had no protection against CSRF attacks so requests to generate or delete dumps could be forged. The vulnerability was patched in commit 67a82b76e186925330b89ace9c5fd893a300830b. There are no known workarounds. You must completely disable DataDump.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32774", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nMiraheze\u00bbDatadumpVersions  before (<) 2021-07-07cpe:2.3:a:miraheze:datadump:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.14%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.19%  0.14%  -0.04 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.19%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-24  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-01-28  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/DataDump/security/advisories/GHSA-29mh-4vhv-x8mr", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in DataDump \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 miraheze/DataDump \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://phabricator.miraheze.org/T7593", "ref_desc": "\u2693 T7593 DataDump is Vulnerable to CSRF AttacksThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/DataDump/commit/67a82b76e186925330b89ace9c5fd893a300830b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-29mh-4vhv-x8mr \u00b7 miraheze/DataDump@67a82b7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
