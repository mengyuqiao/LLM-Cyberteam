{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-30116", "Description": "Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows credential disclosure, as exploited in the wild in July 2021. By default Kaseya VSA on premise offers a download page where the clients for the installation can be downloaded. The default URL for this page is https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp When an attacker download a client for Windows and installs it, the file KaseyaD.ini is generated (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Kaseya\\XXXXXXXXXX\\KaseyaD.ini) which contains an Agent_Guid and AgentPassword This Agent_Guid and AgentPassword can be used to log in on dl.asp (https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp?un=840997037507813&pw=113cc622839a4077a84837485ced6b93e440bf66d44057713cb2f95e503a06d9) This request authenticates the client and returns a sessionId cookie that can be used in subsequent attacks to bypass authentication. Security issues discovered --- * Unauthenticated download page leaks credentials * Credentials of agent software can be used to obtain a sessionId (cookie) that can be used for services not intended for use by agents * dl.asp accepts credentials via a GET request * Access to KaseyaD.ini gives an attacker access to sufficient information to penetrate the Kaseya installation and its clients. Impact --- Via the page /dl.asp enough information can be obtained to give an attacker a sessionId that can be used to execute further (semi-authenticated) attacks against the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30116", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKaseya\u00bbVsa AgentVersions  before (<) 9.5.0.24cpe:2.3:a:kaseya:vsa_agent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKaseya\u00bbVsa ServerVersions  before (<) 9.5.7acpe:2.3:a:kaseya:vsa_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "19.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-17  20.77%  19.97%  -0.80 \n 2  2025-03-30  76.66%  20.77%  -55.89 \n 3  2025-03-29  20.77%  76.66%  +55.89 \n 4  2025-03-22  21.91%  20.77%  -1.14 \n 5  2025-03-17  68.08%  21.91%  -46.17 \n 6  2025-02-20  64.37%  68.08%  +3.71 \n 7  2024-12-17  69.49%  64.37%  -5.11 \n 8  2024-11-11  66.11%  69.49%  +3.38 \n 9  2024-07-30  84.20%  66.11%  -18.09 \n 10  2024-07-12  85.86%  84.20%  -1.66 \n 11  2024-06-27  85.57%  85.86%  +0.28 \n 12  2024-05-31  88.54%  85.57%  -2.96 \n 13  2024-03-24  89.81%  88.54%  -1.27 \n 14  2024-02-13  89.50%  89.81%  +0.31 \n 15  2024-02-07  40.55%  89.50%  +48.95 \n 16  2024-01-18  47.51%  40.55%  -6.97 \n 17  2023-10-24  54.44%  47.51%  -6.92 \n 18  2023-09-22  92.85%  54.44%  -38.41 \n 19  2023-03-29  93.55%  92.85%  -0.69 \n 20  2023-03-07  0.95%  93.55%  +92.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.secpod.com/blog/kaseya-vsa-zero-day-by-revil/", "ref_desc": "Kaseya VSA REvil Ransomware Attack 2021.Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/04/Kaseya-Case-Update-2/", "ref_desc": "Kaseya Case Update 2 | DIVD CSIRTThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/07/Kaseya-Limited-Disclosure/", "ref_desc": "Kaseya VSA Limited Disclosure | DIVD CSIRTThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jFzt6LgG1aaCk3woFs0gBGDZMM8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689-Important-Notice-July-2nd-2021", "ref_desc": "Important Notice July 9th, 2021 \u2013 KaseyaVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
