Although this uses addslashes, and most modern browsers automatically URLencode requests, this plugin is still vulnerable to Reflected XSS in older browsers such as Internet Explorer 9 or below, or in cases where an attacker is able to modify the request en route between the client and the server, or in cases where the user is using an atypical browsing solution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34630", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGtranslate\u00bbGtranslate\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.8.65cpe:2.3:a:gtranslate:gtranslate:*:*:*:*:enterprise:wordpress:*:*Matching versions\nGtranslate\u00bbGtranslate\u00bb     PROEditionForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.8.65cpe:2.3:a:gtranslate:gtranslate:*:*:*:*:pro:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.85% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-01  2.28%  0.85%  -1.42 \n 2  2025-04-30  1.82%  2.28%  +0.46 \n 3  2025-03-30  8.17%  1.82%  -6.35 \n 4  2025-03-29  1.82%  8.17%  +6.35 \n 5  2025-03-24  2.33%  1.82%  -0.51 \n 6  2025-03-23  1.41%  2.33%  +0.92 \n 7  2025-03-17  0.11%  1.41%  +1.30 \n 8  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 9  2024-12-03  0.09%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 10  2024-04-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 11  2024-02-27  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/gtranslate/tags/2.8.64/gtranslate.php", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
