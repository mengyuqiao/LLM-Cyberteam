{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32754", "Description": "FlowDroid is a data flow analysis tool. FlowDroid versions prior to 2.9.0 contained an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability that allowed an attacker who had control over the source/sink definition file in XML format to read files from external locations. In order for this to occur, the XML-based format for sources and sinks had to be used and the attacker had to able control the source/sink definition file. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted entities to control the source/sink definition file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32754", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nFlowdroid Project\u00bbFlowdroidVersions  before (<) 2.9.0cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.59%  0.31%  -0.29 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.31%  0.59%  +0.29 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.31%  +0.24 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid/security/advisories/GHSA-39r7-275f-rvgw", "ref_desc": "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in de.tud.sse \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
