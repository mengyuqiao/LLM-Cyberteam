{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36371", "Description": "Emissary-Ingress (formerly Ambassador API Gateway) through 1.13.9 allows attackers to bypass client certificate requirements (i.e., mTLS cert_required) on backend upstreams when more than one TLSContext is defined and at least one configuration exists that does not require client certificate authentication. The attacker must send an SNI specifying an unprotected backend and an HTTP Host header specifying a protected backend. (2.x versions are unaffected. 1.x versions are unaffected with certain configuration settings involving prune_unreachable_routes and a wildcard Host resource.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36371", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGetambassador\u00bbEmissary-ingressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.13.9cpe:2.3:a:getambassador:emissary-ingress:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-03-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-13  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/issues/3340", "ref_desc": "Bypass mTLS by mixing SNI and Host headers \u00b7 Issue #3340 \u00b7 emissary-ingress/emissary \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/releases/tag/v2.0.0-ea", "ref_desc": "Release Emissary Ingress 2.0.0-ea \u00b7 emissary-ingress/emissary \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
