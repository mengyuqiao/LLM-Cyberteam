{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24385", "Description": "The Filebird Plugin 4.7.3 introduced a SQL injection vulnerability as it is making SQL queries without escaping user input data from a HTTP post request. This is a major vulnerability as the user input is not escaped and passed directly to the get_col function and it allows SQL injection. The Rest API endpoint which invokes this function also does not have any required permissions/authentication and can be accessed by an anonymous user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24385", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nNinjateam\u00bbFilebird\u00bbVersion:4.7.3ForWordpresscpe:2.3:a:ninjateam:filebird:4.7.3:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "9.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  30.69%  9.02%  -21.67 \n 2  2025-03-29  9.02%  30.69%  +21.67 \n 3  2025-03-24  20.88%  9.02%  -11.86 \n 4  2025-03-23  9.02%  20.88%  +11.86 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.38%  9.02%  +8.64 \n 6  2025-02-23  0.31%  0.38%  +0.07 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.31%  +0.08 \n 8  2024-11-14  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 9  2024-06-03  0.20%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 10  2024-03-27  0.21%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 11  2024-02-16  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/754ac750-0262-4f65-b23e-d5523995fbfa", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://10up.com/blog/2021/security-vulnerability-filebird-wordpress-plugin/", "ref_desc": "10up Uncovers Security Vulnerability in FileBird WordPress Plugin, Update Now Available | 10upThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
