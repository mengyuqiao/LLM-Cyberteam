{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1600", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to access sensitive internal services from an external interface. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient restrictions for IPv4 or IPv6 packets that are received on the external management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specific traffic to this interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive internal services and make configuration changes on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1600", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIntersight Virtual Appliance\u00bbVersion:1.0(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:intersight_virtual_appliance:1.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.32%  0.26%  -0.06 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.26%  0.32%  +0.06 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.21%  0.26%  +0.05 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.21%  +0.15 \n 5  2024-04-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucsi2-iptaclbp-L8Dzs8m8", "ref_desc": "Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance IPv4 and IPv6 Forwarding VulnerabilitiesPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3DeB5L66SqyX-nP4Hd_B1lQLVsU.html"}]}
