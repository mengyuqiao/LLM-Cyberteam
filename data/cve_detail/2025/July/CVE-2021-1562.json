{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1562", "Description": "A vulnerability in the XSI-Actions interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation and authorization of specific commands that a user can execute within the XSI-Actions interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a specific set of commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to join a Call Center instance and have calls that they do not have permissions to access distributed to them from the Call Center queue. At the time of publication, Cisco had not released updates that address this vulnerability for Cisco BroadWorks Application Server. However, firmware patches are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1562", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Application ServerVersions  from including (>=) 23.0andbefore (<) 23.0.2020.08cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_application_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Application ServerVersions  from including (>=) 22.0andbefore (<) 22.0.2020.08cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_application_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Application ServerVersions  from including (>=) 24.0andbefore (<) 24.0.2020.08cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_application_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.27%  0.20%  -0.07 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.20%  0.27%  +0.07 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.20%  +0.13 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-broad-as-inf-disc-ZUXGFFXQ", "ref_desc": "Cisco BroadWorks Application Server Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
