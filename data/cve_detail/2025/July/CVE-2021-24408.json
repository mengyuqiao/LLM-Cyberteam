A post made by a contributor would still have to be approved by an admin to have the XSS trigger able in the frontend, however, higher privilege users, such as editor could exploit this without the need of approval, and even when the blog disallows the unfiltered_html capability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24408", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPlugin-planet\u00bbPrismatic\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.8cpe:2.3:a:plugin-planet:prismatic:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.59%  0.16%  -0.43 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.16%  0.59%  +0.43 \n 3  2025-03-24  0.59%  0.16%  -0.43 \n 4  2025-03-23  0.16%  0.59%  +0.43 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.16%  +0.11 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/51855853-e7bd-425f-802c-824209f4f84d", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
