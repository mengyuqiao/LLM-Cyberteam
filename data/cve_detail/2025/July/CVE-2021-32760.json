{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32760", "Description": "containerd is a container runtime. A bug was found in containerd versions prior to 1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where pulling and extracting a specially-crafted container image can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host\u2019s filesystem. Changes to file permissions can deny access to the expected owner of the file, widen access to others, or set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a workaround, ensure that users only pull images from trusted sources. Linux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files potentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent containerd from interacting with specific files.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32760", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbContainerdVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 1.5.4cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbContainerdVersions  before (<) 1.4.8cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.58%  0.14%  -0.44 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.14%  0.58%  +0.44 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.20%  0.14%  -0.06 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-02-23  0.14%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-02-09  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-28  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-11-08  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-c72p-9xmj-rx3w", "ref_desc": "Archive package allows chmod of file outside of unpack target directory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDMNDPJJTP3J5GOEDB66F6MGXUTRG3Y3/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: containerd-1.5.5-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-31", "ref_desc": "containerd: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202401-31) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/E8qJ7BKPUqJpbjRNihYqmMHwIkw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.8", "ref_desc": "Release containerd 1.4.8 \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.4", "ref_desc": "Release containerd 1.5.4 \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDMNDPJJTP3J5GOEDB66F6MGXUTRG3Y3/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: containerd-1.5.5-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
