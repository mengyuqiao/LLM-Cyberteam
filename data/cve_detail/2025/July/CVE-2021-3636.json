{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-3636", "Description": "It was found in OpenShift, before version 4.8, that the generated certificate for the in-cluster Service CA, incorrectly included additional certificates. The Service CA is automatically mounted into all pods, allowing them to safely connect to trusted in-cluster services that present certificates signed by the trusted Service CA. The incorrect inclusion of additional CAs in this certificate would allow an attacker that compromises any of the additional CAs to masquerade as a trusted in-cluster service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3636", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshiftVersions  before (<) 4.8cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978621", "ref_desc": "1978621 \u2013 (CVE-2021-3636) CVE-2021-3636 openshift: Injected service-ca.crt incorrectly contains additional internal CAsExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
