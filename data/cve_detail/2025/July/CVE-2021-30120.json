{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-30120", "Description": "Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows attackers to bypass the 2FA requirement. The need to use 2FA for authentication in enforce client-side instead of server-side and can be bypassed using a local proxy. Thus rendering 2FA useless. Detailed description --- During the login process, after the user authenticates with username and password, the server sends a response to the client with the booleans MFARequired and MFAEnroled. If the attacker has obtained a password of a user and used an intercepting proxy (e.g. Burp Suite) to change the value of MFARequered from True to False, there is no prompt for the second factor, but the user is still logged in.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30120", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKaseya\u00bbVSA\u00bbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.5.6cpe:2.3:a:kaseya:vsa:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-05  0.14%  0.12%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-06-01  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-05-06  0.14%  0.12%  -0.02 \n 4  2025-05-01  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 5  2025-04-10  0.06%  0.12%  +0.06 \n 6  2025-03-30  0.13%  0.06%  -0.07 \n 7  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.13%  +0.07 \n 8  2025-03-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 9  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.08%  -0.04 \n 10  2024-03-24  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 11  2024-02-13  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 12  2024-01-18  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-669 Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/669/Incorrect-Resource-Transfer-Between-Spheres.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://csrit.divd.nl/DIVD-2021-00011", "ref_desc": "Permissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/07/Kaseya-Limited-Disclosure/", "ref_desc": "Kaseya VSA Limited Disclosure | DIVD CSIRTPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jFzt6LgG1aaCk3woFs0gBGDZMM8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://csrit.divd.nl/CVE-2021-30120", "ref_desc": "Permissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
