{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32707", "Description": "Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32707", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbMailVersions  before (<) 1.9.6cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:mail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.34%  0.64%  +0.30 \n 2  2025-06-01  0.64%  0.34%  -0.30 \n 3  2025-05-14  0.34%  0.64%  +0.30 \n 4  2025-05-13  0.64%  0.34%  -0.30 \n 5  2025-05-04  0.34%  0.64%  +0.30 \n 6  2025-05-01  0.64%  0.34%  -0.30 \n 7  2025-04-11  0.34%  0.64%  +0.30 \n 8  2025-04-10  0.64%  0.34%  -0.30 \n 9  2025-03-30  0.59%  0.64%  +0.05 \n 10  2025-03-29  0.64%  0.59%  -0.05 \n 11  2025-03-18  0.34%  0.64%  +0.30 \n 12  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.34%  +0.27 \n 13  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 14  2023-10-04  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 15  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-xxp4-44xc-8crh", "ref_desc": "Bypass of image blocking in Nextcloud Mail \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1215251", "ref_desc": "Sign inExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/mail/pull/5189", "ref_desc": "Sanitize urls in css style sheets by st3iny \u00b7 Pull Request #5189 \u00b7 nextcloud/mail \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
