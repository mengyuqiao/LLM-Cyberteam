{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32714", "Description": "hyper is an HTTP library for Rust. In versions prior to 0.14.10, hyper's HTTP server and client code had a flaw that could trigger an integer overflow when decoding chunk sizes that are too big. This allows possible data loss, or if combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that allows chunk sizes larger than hyper does, can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks.\" The vulnerability is patched in version 0.14.10. Two possible workarounds exist. One may reject requests manually that contain a `Transfer-Encoding` header or ensure any upstream proxy rejects `Transfer-Encoding` chunk sizes greater than what fits in 64-bit unsigned integers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32714", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nHyper\u00bbHyper\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.14.10cpe:2.3:a:hyper:hyper:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.78%  0.40%  -0.38 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.40%  0.78%  +0.38 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.40%  +0.31 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-03-22  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-11  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/security/advisories/GHSA-5h46-h7hh-c6x9", "ref_desc": "Integer Overflow in Chunked Transfer-Encoding \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hyperium/hyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
