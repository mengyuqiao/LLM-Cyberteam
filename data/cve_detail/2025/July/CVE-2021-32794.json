{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32794", "Description": "ArchiSteamFarm is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32794", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nArchisteamfarm Project\u00bbArchisteamfarmVersions  before (<) 5.1.2.4cpe:2.3:a:archisteamfarm_project:archisteamfarm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.67%  0.35%  -0.33 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.35%  0.67%  +0.33 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.71%  0.35%  -0.36 \n 4  2025-03-09  0.58%  0.71%  +0.13 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.61%  0.58%  -0.03 \n 6  2024-11-28  0.60%  0.61%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-08-28  0.42%  0.60%  +0.18 \n 8  2024-06-17  0.43%  0.42%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-10-18  0.34%  0.43%  +0.10 \n 10  2023-03-17  0.29%  0.34%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.29%  -0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://steamcommunity.com/groups/archiasf/discussions/6/3057365873428498659/", "ref_desc": "Beware of unknown method which steal inventory through ASF IPC(on VPS) :: Archi's SC FarmExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/security/advisories/GHSA-wxx4-66c2-vj2v", "ref_desc": "Accidental removal of IPCPassword (< 5.1.2.4) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/pull/2379", "ref_desc": "Fix GlobalConfig update via IPC removing IPCPassword by Abrynos \u00b7 Pull Request #2379 \u00b7 JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
