{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48940", "Description": "MyBB is free and open source forum software. Prior to version 1.8.39, the upgrade component does not validate user input properly, which allows attackers to perform local file inclusion (LFI) via a specially crafted parameter value. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the installer must be unlocked (no `install/lock` file present) and the upgrade script must be accessible (by re-installing the forum via access to `install/index.php`; when the forum has not yet been installed; or the attacker is authenticated as a forum administrator). MyBB 1.8.39 resolves this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48940", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.39", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6wCDSTWpXR3SawvS2bjfLTOhOGs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-q4jv-xwjx-37cp", "ref_desc": "Upgrade local file inclusion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mybb/mybb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/6e6cfbd524d9101b51e1278ecf520479b64b0f00", "ref_desc": "Fix Upgrade local file inclusion (CVE-2025-48940) \u00b7 mybb/mybb@6e6cfbd \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
