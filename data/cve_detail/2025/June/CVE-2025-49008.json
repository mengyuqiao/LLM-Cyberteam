{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-49008", "Description": "Atheos is a self-hosted browser-based cloud integrated development environment. Prior to version 6.0.4, improper use of `escapeshellcmd()` in `/components/codegit/traits/execute.php` allows argument injection, leading to arbitrary command execution. Atheos administrators and users of vulnerable versions are at risk of data breaches or server compromise. Version 6.0.4 introduces a `Common::safe_execute` function that sanitizes all arguments using `escapeshellarg()` prior to execution and migrated all components potentially vulnerable to similar exploits to use this new templated execution system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49008", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Atheos/Atheos/security/advisories/GHSA-rwc2-4q8c-xj48", "ref_desc": "Improper Input Validation Enables RCE in Common.php \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Atheos/Atheos \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Atheos/Atheos/commit/7e6c0eb45fa6d04d786a0037389540f2638fe792", "ref_desc": "Mitigated argument injection vulnerability in command execution (GHSA\u2026 \u00b7 Atheos/Atheos@7e6c0eb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
