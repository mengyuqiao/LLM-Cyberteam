{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-29785", "Description": "quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. The loss recovery logic for path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious QUIC client. In order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic: the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference. v0.50.1 contains a patch that fixes the vulnerability. This release contains a test that generates random sequences of sent packets (both regular and path probe packets), that was used to verify that the patch actually covers all corner cases. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29785", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-j972-j939-p2v3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/issues/4981", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/b90058aba5f65f48e0e150c89bbaa21a72dda4de", "ref_desc": "ackhandler: fix panic in probe packet tracking logic (#4998) \u00b7 quic-go/quic-go@b90058a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
