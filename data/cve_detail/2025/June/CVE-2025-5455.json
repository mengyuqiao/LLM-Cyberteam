{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-5455", "Description": "An issue was found in the private API function qDecodeDataUrl() in QtCore, which is used in QTextDocument and QNetworkReply, and, potentially, in user code.\n\nIf the function was called with malformed data, for example, an URL that\ncontained a \"charset\" parameter that lacked a value (such as\n\"data:charset,\"), and Qt was built with assertions enabled, then it would hit an assertion, resulting in a denial of service\n(abort).\n\nThis impacts Qt up to 5.15.18, 6.0.0->6.5.8, 6.6.0->6.8.3 and 6.9.0. This has been fixed in 5.15.19, 6.5.9, 6.8.4 and 6.9.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5455", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/642006", "ref_desc": "qDecodeDataUrl(): fix precondition violation in call to QByteArrayView::at() (642006) \u00b7 Gerrit Code Review", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
