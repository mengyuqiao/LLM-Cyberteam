{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46339", "Description": "FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. Prior to version 1.26.2, it's possible to poison feed favicons by adding a given URL as a feed with the proxy set to an attacker-controlled one and disabled SSL verifying. The favicon hash is computed by hashing the feed URL and the salt, whilst not including the following variables: proxy address, proxy protocol, and whether SSL should be verified. Therefore it's possible to poison a favicon of a given feed by simply intercepting the response of the feed, and changing the website URL to one where a threat actor controls the feed favicon. Feed favicons can be replaced for all users by anyone. Version 1.26.2 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46339", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-349 Acceptance of Extraneous Untrusted Data With Trusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/349/Acceptance-of-Extraneous-Untrusted-Data-With-Trusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/3776e1e48f33e80eb4b674bb64b419caf3b5a4e2", "ref_desc": "Improve favicon hash (#7505) \u00b7 FreshRSS/FreshRSS@3776e1e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-8f79-3q3w-43c4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
