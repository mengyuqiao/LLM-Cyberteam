{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47289", "Description": "CE Phoenix is a free, open-source eCommerce platform. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in CE Phoenix versions 1.0.9.9 through 1.1.0.2 where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the testimonial description field. Once submitted, if the shop owner (admin) approves the testimonial, the script executes in the context of any user visiting the testimonial page. Because the session cookies are not marked with the `HttpOnly` flag, they can be exfiltrated by the attacker \u2014 potentially leading to account takeover. Version 1.1.0.3 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47289", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-06-03  0.03%  0.03%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1004 Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1004/Sensitive-Cookie-Without-HttpOnly-Flag.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CE-PhoenixCart/PhoenixCart/security/advisories/GHSA-98qq-m8qj-vvgj", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in CE Phoenix Cart Testimonials Allows Account Takeover if Missing HttpOnly Flag \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CE-PhoenixCart/PhoenixCart \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uQAEjewSL9jWWu1UHe47tAnM7U4_x39g/view?usp=drive_link", "ref_desc": "nohttpOnly-XSS.mp4 - Google Drive", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
