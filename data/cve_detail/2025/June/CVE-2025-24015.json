{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24015", "Description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Versions 1.46.0 through 2.1.6 have an issue that affects AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM in Deno in which the authentication tag is not being validated. This means tampered ciphertexts or incorrect keys might not be detected, which breaks the guarantees expected from AES-GCM. Older versions of Deno correctly threw errors in such cases, as does Node.js. Without authentication tag verification, AES-GCM degrades to essentially CTR mode, removing integrity protection. Authenticated data set with set_aad is also affected, as it is incorporated into the GCM hash (ghash) but this too is not validated, rendering AAD checks ineffective. Version 2.1.7 includes a patch that addresses this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24015", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-2x3r-hwv5-p32x", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/4f27d7cdc02e3edfb9d36275341fb8185d6e99ed", "ref_desc": "fix(ext/node): GCM auth tag check on DechiperIv#final (#27733) \u00b7 denoland/deno@4f27d7c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/0d1beed", "ref_desc": "fix(ext/node): add `CipherIv.setAutoPadding()` (#24940) \u00b7 denoland/deno@0d1beed \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/a4003a5292bd0affefad3ecb24a8732886900f67", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
