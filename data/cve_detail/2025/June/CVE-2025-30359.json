{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30359", "Description": "webpack-dev-server allows users to use webpack with a development server that provides live reloading. Prior to version 5.2.1, webpack-dev-server users' source code may be stolen when they access a malicious web site. Because the request for classic script by a script tag is not subject to same origin policy, an attacker can inject a malicious script in their site and run the script. Note that the attacker has to know the port and the output entrypoint script path. Combined with prototype pollution, the attacker can get a reference to the webpack runtime variables. By using `Function::toString` against the values in `__webpack_modules__`, the attacker can get the source code. Version 5.2.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30359", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-749 Exposed Dangerous Method or Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/749/Exposed-Dangerous-Method-or-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/security/advisories/GHSA-4v9v-hfq4-rm2v", "ref_desc": "Source code may be stolen when you access a malicious web site \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 webpack/webpack-dev-server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/d2575ad8dfed9207ed810b5ea0ccf465115a2239", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 webpack/webpack-dev-server@d2575ad \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
