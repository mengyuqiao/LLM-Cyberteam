{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-30360", "Description": "webpack-dev-server allows users to use webpack with a development server that provides live reloading. Prior to version 5.2.1, webpack-dev-server users' source code may be stolen when you access a malicious web site with non-Chromium based browser. The `Origin` header is checked to prevent Cross-site WebSocket hijacking from happening, which was reported by CVE-2018-14732. But webpack-dev-server always allows IP address `Origin` headers. This allows websites that are served on IP addresses to connect WebSocket. An attacker can obtain source code via a method similar to that used to exploit CVE-2018-14732. Version 5.2.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30360", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/72efaab83381a0e1c4914adf401cbd210b7de7eb", "ref_desc": "Always allow requests with IP-address as host in checkHost() (#1007) \u00b7 webpack/webpack-dev-server@72efaab \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/security/advisories/GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h", "ref_desc": "Source code may be stolen when you access a malicious web site with non-Chromium based browser \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 webpack/webpack-dev-server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/5c9378bb01276357d7af208a0856ca2163db188e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/55220a800ba4e30dbde2d98785ecf4c80b32f711/lib/Server.js#L3113-L3127", "ref_desc": "webpack-dev-server/lib/Server.js at 55220a800ba4e30dbde2d98785ecf4c80b32f711 \u00b7 webpack/webpack-dev-server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
