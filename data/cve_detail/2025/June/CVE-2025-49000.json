{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-49000", "Description": "InvenTree is an Open Source Inventory Management System. Prior to version 0.17.13, the skip field in the built-in `label-sheet` plugin lacks an upper bound, so a large value forces the server to allocate an enormous Python list. This lets any authenticated label-printing user trigger a denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. the issue is fixed in versions 0.17.13 and higher. No workaround is available aside from upgrading to the patched version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49000", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/commit/0826a75ef6dde0ad96d680f52a9cf171ba2ce98b", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 inventree/InvenTree@0826a75 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/security/advisories/GHSA-m2ch-h84r-p9r6", "ref_desc": "Uncontrolled memory allocation via built-in label-sheet plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 inventree/InvenTree \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/0.17.13", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
