{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48990", "Description": "NeKernal is a free and open-source operating system stack. Version 0.0.2 has a 1-byte heap overflow in `rt_copy_memory`, which unconditionally wrote a null terminator at `dst[len]`. When `len` equals the size of the destination buffer (256 bytes), that extra `'\\0'` write overruns the buffer by one byte. To avoid breaking existing callers or changing the public API, the patch in commit fb7b7f658327f659c6a6da1af151cb389c2ca4ee takes a minimal approach: it simply removes the overflow-causing line without adding bounds checks or altering the function signature.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48990", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.01%  0.02%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nekernel-org/nekernel/security/advisories/GHSA-jvvh-fp57-2p32", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nekernel-org/nekernel/commit/fb7b7f658327f659c6a6da1af151cb389c2ca4ee", "ref_desc": "Heap Overflow in `rt_copy_memory` \u00b7 nekernel-org/nekernel@fb7b7f6 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
