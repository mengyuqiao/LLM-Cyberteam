{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48957", "Description": "AstrBot is a large language model chatbot and development framework. A path traversal vulnerability present in versions 3.4.4 through 3.5.12 may lead to information disclosure, such as API keys for LLM providers, account passwords, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability has been addressed in Pull Request #1676 and is included in version 3.5.13. As a workaround, users can edit the `cmd_config.json` file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary workaround. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later to fully resolve this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48957", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-06-03  0.03%  0.07%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/pull/1676", "ref_desc": "Fix: fixed a potential vulnerability in `/api/chat/get_file` endpoint. by Soulter \u00b7 Pull Request #1676 \u00b7 AstrBotDevs/AstrBot \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/commit/cceadf222c46813c7f41115b40d371e7eb91e492", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #1676 from AstrBotDevs/fix-chat-get-file-bug \u00b7 AstrBotDevs/AstrBot@cceadf2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/issues/1675", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/security/advisories/GHSA-cq37-g2qp-3c2p", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
