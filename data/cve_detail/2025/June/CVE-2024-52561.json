{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52561", "Description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Snapshot functionality of Parallels Desktop for Mac version 20.1.1 (build 55740). When a snapshot of a virtual machine is deleted, a root service verifies and modifies the ownership of the snapshot files. By using a symlink, an attacker can change the ownership of files owned by root to a lower-privilege user, potentially leading to privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52561", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 1 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-708 Incorrect Ownership Assignment", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/708/Incorrect-Ownership-Assignment.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2123", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2024-2123 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat Intelligence", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2123", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
