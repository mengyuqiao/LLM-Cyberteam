{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48995", "Description": "SignXML is an implementation of the W3C XML Signature standard in Python. When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False, hmac_key=...`), versions of SignXML prior to 4.0.4 are vulnerable to a potential timing attack. The verifier may leak information about the correct HMAC when comparing it with the user supplied hash, allowing users to reconstruct the correct HMAC for any data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48995", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/XML-Security/signxml/security/advisories/GHSA-gmhf-gg8w-jw42", "ref_desc": "Signature verification with HMAC is vulnerable to a timing attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 XML-Security/signxml \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/XML-Security/signxml/commit/1b501faaacf34cf978a52dbc6915ec11e27611cd", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 XML-Security/signxml@1b501fa \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
