An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a machine-in-the-middle attack on SSH connections to Cisco NDFC-managed devices, which could allow an attacker to intercept this traffic. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate a managed device and capture user credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-20163", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-322 Key Exchange without Entity Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/322/Key-Exchange-without-Entity-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndfc-shkv-snQJtjrp", "ref_desc": "Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller SSH Host Key Validation Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
