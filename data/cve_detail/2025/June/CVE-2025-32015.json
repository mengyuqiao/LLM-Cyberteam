{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-32015", "Description": "FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. Prior to version 1.26.2, HTML is sanitized improperly inside the `<iframe srcdoc>` attribute, which leads to cross-site scripting (XSS) by loading an attacker's UserJS inside `<script src>`. In order to execute the attack, the attacker needs to control one of the victim's feeds and have an account on the FreshRSS instance that the victim is using. An attacker can gain access to the victim's account by exploiting this vulnerability. If the victim is an admin it would be possible to delete all users (cause damage) or execute arbitrary code on the server by modifying the update URL using fetch() via the XSS. Version 1.26.2 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32015", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-wgrq-mcwc-8f8v", "ref_desc": "XSS by embedding <script> tag inside <iframe srcdoc> \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FreshRSS/FreshRSS \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/54e2f9107d03c5b3bb260f38fdb2736bce449fd4", "ref_desc": "Disallow iframe srcdoc for now (#7494) \u00b7 FreshRSS/FreshRSS@54e2f91 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
