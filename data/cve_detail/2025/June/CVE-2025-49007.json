{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-49007", "Description": "Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Starting in version 3.1.0 and prior to version 3.1.16, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the Content-Disposition parsing component of Rack. This is very similar to the previous security issue CVE-2022-44571. Carefully crafted input can cause Content-Disposition header parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is used typically used in multipart parsing. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted. Version 3.1.16 contains a patch for the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49007", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/aed514df37e33907df3c971ed3ca9a0a20ac2901", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-47m2-26rw-j2jw", "ref_desc": "ReDoS Vulnerability in Rack::Multipart handle_mime_head \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rack/rack \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/4795831a0a310c2d31102749e551b38faab6401f", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
