{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48947", "Description": "The Auth0 Next.js SDK is a library for implementing user authentication in Next.js applications. In Auth0 Next.js SDK versions 4.0.1 through 4.6.0, `__session` cookies set by auth0.middleware may be cached by CDNs due to missing Cache-Control headers. Three preconditions must be met in order for someone to be affected by the vulnerability: Applications using the NextJS-Auth0 SDK, versions between 4.0.1 to 4.6.0, applications using CDN or edge caching that caches responses with the Set-Cookie header, and if the Cache-Control header is not properly set for sensitive responses. Users should upgrade auth0/nextjs-auth0 to v4.6.1 to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48947", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-525 Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/525/Use-of-Web-Browser-Cache-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-f3fg-mf2q-fj3f", "ref_desc": "CDN Caching of Session Cookies in NextJS-Auth0 SDK \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 auth0/nextjs-auth0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
