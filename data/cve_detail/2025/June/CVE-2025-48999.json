In a malicious payload, `getUrlType()` retrieves `hostName`. Since the judgment statement returns false, it will not enter the if statement and will not be filtered. The payload can be directly concatenated at the replace location to construct a malicious JDBC statement. Version 2.10.10 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48999", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDataease\u00bbDataeaseVersions  before (<) 2.10.10cpe:2.3:a:dataease:dataease:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-923 Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/923/Improper-Restriction-of-Communication-Channel-to-Intended-En.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dataease/dataease/commit/03b18db8a0fb7e9dc2c44f6d26d8c6221b7748c4", "ref_desc": "fix: \u8fc7\u6ee4 redshift \u975e\u6cd5\u53c2\u6570 \u00b7 dataease/dataease@03b18db \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dataease/dataease/security/advisories/GHSA-6pq2-6q8x-mp2r", "ref_desc": "Dataease Redshift Data Source JDBC Connection Parameters Not Verified Leads to RCE Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dataease/dataease \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
