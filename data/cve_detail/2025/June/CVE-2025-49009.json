{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-49009", "Description": "Para is a multitenant backend server/framework for object persistence and retrieval. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.50.8 in `FacebookAuthFilter.java` results in a full request URL being logged during a failed request to a Facebook user profile. The log includes the user's access token in plain text. Since WARN-level logs are often retained in production and accessible to operators or log aggregation systems, this poses a risk of token exposure. Version 1.50.8 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49009", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 1 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Erudika/para/security/advisories/GHSA-qx7g-fx8q-545g", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Erudika/para/commit/46a908d887da02037384193f70a69345f04887cf", "ref_desc": "fixed CWE-532 in FacebookAuthFilter - improper logging of sensitive i\u2026 \u00b7 Erudika/para@46a908d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
