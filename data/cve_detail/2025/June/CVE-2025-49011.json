{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-49011", "Description": "SpiceDB is an open source database for storing and querying fine-grained authorization data. Prior to version 1.44.2, on schemas involving arrows with caveats on the arrow\u2019ed relation, when the path to resolve a CheckPermission request involves the evaluation of multiple caveated branches, requests may return a negative response when a positive response is expected. Version 1.44.2 fixes the issue. As a workaround, do not use caveats in the schema over an arrow\u2019ed relation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49011", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-358 Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/358/Improperly-Implemented-Security-Check-for-Standard.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-cwwm-hr97-qfxm", "ref_desc": "Checks involving relations with caveats can result in no permission when permission is expected \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.44.2", "ref_desc": "Release v1.44.2 \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/fe8dd9f491f6975b3408c401e413a530eb181a67", "ref_desc": "fix: Checks involving relations with caveats can result in no permiss\u2026 \u00b7 authzed/spicedb@fe8dd9f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
