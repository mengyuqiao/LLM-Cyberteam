{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-38002", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/fdinfo: grab ctx->uring_lock around io_uring_show_fdinfo()\n\nNot everything requires locking in there, which is why the 'has_lock'\nvariable exists. But enough does that it's a bit unwieldy to manage.\nWrap the whole thing in a ->uring_lock trylock, and just return\nwith no output if we fail to grab it. The existing trylock() will\nalready have greatly diminished utility/output for the failure case.\n\nThis fixes an issue with reading the SQE fields, if the ring is being\nactively resized at the same time.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38002", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d871198ee431d90f5308d53998c1ba1d5db5619a", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bdb7d2ec2e31c46c45d1f32667dfa8216a72705e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
