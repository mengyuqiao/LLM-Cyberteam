{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-47272", "Description": "The CE Phoenix eCommerce platform, starting in version 1.0.9.7 and prior to version 1.1.0.3, allowed logged-in users to delete their accounts without requiring password re-authentication. An attacker with temporary access to an authenticated session (e.g., on a shared/public machine) could permanently delete the user\u2019s account without knowledge of the password. This bypass of re-authentication puts users at risk of account loss and data disruption. Version 1.1.0.3 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47272", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CE-PhoenixCart/PhoenixCart/commit/e87162b15d31c4126acfc1aad6108e5b9955bb76", "ref_desc": "Add password to Nuke Account page \u00b7 CE-PhoenixCart/PhoenixCart@e87162b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CE-PhoenixCart/PhoenixCart/security/advisories/GHSA-62qj-pvwm-h8cv", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
