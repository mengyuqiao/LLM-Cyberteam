{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48994", "Description": "SignXML is an implementation of the W3C XML Signature standard in Python. When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False, hmac_key=...`), versions of SignXML prior to 4.0.4 are vulnerable to a potential algorithm confusion attack. Unless the user explicitly limits the expected signature algorithms using the `signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(expect_config=...)` setting, an attacker may supply a signature unexpectedly signed with a key other than the provided HMAC key, using a different (asymmetric key) signature algorithm. Starting with SignXML 4.0.4, specifying `hmac_key` causes the set of accepted signature algorithms to be restricted to HMAC only, if not already restricted by the user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48994", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-303 Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/303/Incorrect-Implementation-of-Authentication-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/XML-Security/signxml/security/advisories/GHSA-6vx8-pcwv-xhf4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/XML-Security/signxml/commit/e3c0c2b82a3329a65d917830657649c98b8c7600", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 XML-Security/signxml@e3c0c2b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
