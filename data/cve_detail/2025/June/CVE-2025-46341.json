{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-46341", "Description": "FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. Prior to version 1.26.2, when the server is using HTTP auth via reverse proxy, it's possible to impersonate any user either via the `Remote-User` header or the `X-WebAuth-User` header by making specially crafted requests via the add feed functionality and obtaining the CSRF token via XPath scraping. The attacker has to know the IP address of the proxied FreshRSS instance and the admin's username, while also having an account on the instance. An attacker can send specially crafted requests in order to gain unauthorized access to internal services. This can also lead to privilege escalation like in the demonstrated scenario, although users that have setup OIDC are not affected by privilege escalation. Version 1.26.2 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46341", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/6bb8680ae0051b9a2ff344f17814f4fa5d844628", "ref_desc": "HTTP Auth disallow multiple headers (#7528) \u00b7 FreshRSS/FreshRSS@6bb8680 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-w3m8-wcf4-h8vm", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
