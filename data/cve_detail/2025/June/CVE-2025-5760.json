{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-5760", "Description": "The Simple History plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive data exposure via Detective Mode due to improper sanitization within the append_debug_info_to_context() function in versions prior to 5.8.1. When Detective Mode is enabled, the plugin\u2019s logger captures the entire contents of $_POST (and sometimes raw request bodies or $_GET) without redacting any password\u2010related keys. As a result, whenever a user submits a login form, whether via native wp_login or a third\u2010party login widget, their actual password is written in clear text into the logs. An authenticated attacker or any user whose actions generate a login event will have their password recorded; an administrator (or anyone with database read access) can then read those logs and retrieve every captured password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5760", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-07  0.03%  0.03%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/256/Plaintext-Storage-of-a-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/546", "ref_desc": "Remove more sensitive fields when detective mode is enabled \u00b7 Issue #546 \u00b7 bonny/WordPress-Simple-History", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b6364415-da02-4236-b635-d8fbd27faa33?source=cve", "ref_desc": "Simple History <= 5.8.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Sensitive Information Exposure via Detective Mode", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/commit/68eab0cab6882eafef4bfece884093eeda5ac018", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://simple-history.com/support/detective-mode/", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-history/#developers", "ref_desc": "Simple History \u2013 Track, Log, and Audit WordPress Changes \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.org", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3267487/", "ref_desc": "Changeset 3267487 \u2013 WordPress Plugin Repository", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/support/topic/security-vulnerability-passwords-stored-as-plain-text-in-logs/", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerability \u2013 Passwords stored as plain text in logs | WordPress.org", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
