{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-48495", "Description": "Gokapi is a self-hosted file sharing server with automatic expiration and encryption support. By renaming the friendly name of an API key, an authenticated user could inject JS into the API key overview, which would also be executed when another user clicks on his API tab. Prior to version 2.0.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users of versions prior to 2.0.0. If a user is the only authenticated user using Gokapi, they are not affected. This issue has been fixed in v2.0.0. A workaround would be to not open the API page if it is possible that another user might have injected code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48495", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.03%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-06-03  0.02%  0.03%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-87 Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/87/Improper-Neutralization-of-Alternate-XSS-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Forceu/Gokapi/commit/65ddbc68fbfdf1c80cadb477f4bcbb7f2c4fdbf8", "ref_desc": "Fix CVE-2025-48495 XSS vulnerability for API key name, refactoring an\u2026 \u00b7 Forceu/Gokapi@65ddbc6 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Forceu/Gokapi/security/advisories/GHSA-4xg4-54hm-9j77", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
