{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-49128", "Description": "Jackson-core contains core low-level incremental (\"streaming\") parser and generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.13.0, a flaw in jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible information disclosure in systems using pooled or reused buffers, like Netty or Vert.x. This issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via PR #652. All users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later. If upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the issue by disabling exception message exposure to clients to avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses and/or disabling source inclusion in exceptions to prevent Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49128", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.00% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~  % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/commit/a6c297682737dde13337cb7c3020f299518609a8", "ref_desc": "Fix #652 \u00b7 FasterXML/jackson-core@a6c2976 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652", "ref_desc": "Misleading exception for input source when processing byte buffer with start offset (see `JsonProcessingException`) \u00b7 Issue #652 \u00b7 FasterXML/jackson-core", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-wf8f-6423-gfxg", "ref_desc": "Memory Disclosure via Source Snippet in JsonLocation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FasterXML/jackson-core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
