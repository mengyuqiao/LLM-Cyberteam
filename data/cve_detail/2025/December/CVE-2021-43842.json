{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43842", "Description": "Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43842", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRequarks\u00bbWiki.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.257cpe:2.3:a:requarks:wiki.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.25%  0.22%  -0.03 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.25%  +0.19 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-3qv4-gp35-rgh7", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via SVG file upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718", "ref_desc": "fix: sanitize SVG uploads \u00b7 Requarks/wiki@5d3e814 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U1OmILET62l9uivFxE2T5_ANzsQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/releases/tag/2.5.260", "ref_desc": "Release 2.5.260 \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
