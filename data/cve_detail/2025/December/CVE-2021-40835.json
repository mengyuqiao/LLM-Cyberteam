{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40835", "Description": "An URL Address bar spoofing vulnerability was discovered in Safe Browser for iOS. When user clicks on a specially crafted a malicious URL, if user does not carefully pay attention to url, user may be tricked to think content may be coming from a valid domain, while it comes from another. This is performed by using a very long username part of the url so that user cannot see the domain name. A remote attacker can leverage this to perform url address bar spoofing attack. The fix is, browser no longer shows the user name part in address bar.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40835", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nF-secure\u00bbSafe\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 18.3cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.44%  0.21%  -0.24 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.21%  0.44%  +0.24 \n 3  2025-03-26  0.30%  0.21%  -0.09 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.15%  0.30%  +0.15 \n 5  2024-12-19  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-08-31  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-07-22  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-07-09  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-05-29  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.f-secure.com/en/business/support-and-downloads/security-advisories", "ref_desc": "Security advisories | F-SecureVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ESeJvuYEO3JjEM9XqebI2S-n2HQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.f-secure.com/en/business/programs/vulnerability-reward-program/hall-of-fame", "ref_desc": "Hall of Fame | F-SecureVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rvZ30YlTE5AKAseoUimU0rsRWqo.html"}]}
