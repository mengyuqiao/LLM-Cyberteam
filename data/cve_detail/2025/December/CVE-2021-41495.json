{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41495", "Description": "Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability exists in numpy.sort in NumPy &lt and 1.19 in the PyArray_DescrNew function due to missing return-value validation, which allows attackers to conduct DoS attacks by repetitively creating sort arrays. NOTE: While correct that validation is missing, an error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If the user can exhaust memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should be practically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memory exhaustion to occur at exactly this place", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41495", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNumpy\u00bbNumpyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.19.0cpe:2.3:a:numpy:numpy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-07  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 3  2025-04-19  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.20%  0.09%  -0.11 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.09%  0.20%  +0.11 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 8  2023-07-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-07-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-08  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19038", "ref_desc": "Missing return-value validation of the function PyArray_DescrNew \u00b7 Issue #19038 \u00b7 numpy/numpy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/z0T4vZZMJxuRWtccNkz5b23_D-0.html"}]}
