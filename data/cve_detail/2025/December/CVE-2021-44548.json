{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44548", "Description": "An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in DataImportHandler of Apache Solr allows an attacker to provide a Windows UNC path resulting in an SMB network call being made from the Solr host to another host on the network. If the attacker has wider access to the network, this may lead to SMB attacks, which may result in: * The exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes), * In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks which can lead to user impersonation on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code Execution This issue affects all Apache Solr versions prior to 8.11.1. This issue only affects Windows.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44548", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSolrVersions  before (<) 8.11.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:solr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-14  2.13%  1.13%  -1.00 \n 2  2025-03-30  5.45%  2.13%  -3.32 \n 3  2025-03-29  2.13%  5.45%  +3.32 \n 4  2025-03-20  2.27%  2.13%  -0.14 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.36%  2.27%  +1.91 \n 6  2025-02-23  0.30%  0.36%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.63%  0.30%  -0.33 \n 8  2024-09-07  0.53%  0.63%  +0.10 \n 9  2024-07-29  0.49%  0.53%  +0.04 \n 10  2024-03-16  0.41%  0.49%  +0.07 \n 11  2023-12-20  0.46%  0.41%  -0.05 \n 12  2023-12-08  0.36%  0.46%  +0.10 \n 13  2023-07-31  0.35%  0.36%  +0.02 \n 14  2023-07-16  0.29%  0.35%  +0.06 \n 15  2023-06-05  0.21%  0.29%  +0.08 \n 16  2023-05-09  0.21%  0.21%  +0.00 \n 17  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.21%  -1.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-40 Path Traversal: '\\\\UNC\\share\\name\\' (Windows UNC Share)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/40/Path-Traversal-UNC-share-name-Windows-UNC-Share-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://solr.apache.org/security.html#cve-2021-44548-apache-solr-information-disclosure-vulnerability-through-dataimporthandler", "ref_desc": "Solr\u2122 Security News - Apache SolrVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220114-0005/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-44548 Apache Solr Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
