{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41242", "Description": "OpenOlat is a web-basedlearning management system. A path traversal vulnerability exists in OpenOlat prior to versions 15.5.12 and 16.0.5. By providing a filename that contains a relative path as a parameter in some REST methods, it is possible to create directory structures and write files anywhere on the target system. The attack could be used to write files anywhere in the web root folder or outside, depending on the configuration of the system and the properly configured permission of the application server user. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account, an enabled REST API and the rights on a business object to call the vulnerable REST calls. The problem is fixed in version 15.5.12 and 16.0.5. There is a workaround available. The vulnerability requires the REST module to be enabled. Disabling the REST module or limiting the REST module via some firewall or web-server access rules to be accessed only be trusted systems will mitigate the risk.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41242", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nFrentix\u00bbOpenolatVersions  from including (>=) 16.0.0andbefore (<) 16.0.5cpe:2.3:a:frentix:openolat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrentix\u00bbOpenolatVersions  before (<) 15.5.12cpe:2.3:a:frentix:openolat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.21%  0.79%  -0.42 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.79%  1.21%  +0.42 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.69%  0.79%  +0.10 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.19%  0.69%  +0.50 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.19%  -0.08 \n 6  2024-08-12  0.19%  0.27%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-08-01  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-07-18  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-07-03  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/commit/c450df7d7ffe6afde39ebca6da9136f1caa16ec4", "ref_desc": "OO-5819: container can only create file in its own path \u00b7 OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT@c450df7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/security/advisories/GHSA-62hv-rfp4-hmrm", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal in some REST methods leading to file upload to arbitrary places \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.openolat.org/browse/OO-5819", "ref_desc": "Log in - OpenOlat Issue ManagementPermissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/commit/336d5ce80681be61a0bbf4f73d2af5d1ff67e93a", "ref_desc": "OO-5819: clean starting / for backward compatibility \u00b7 OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT@336d5ce \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
