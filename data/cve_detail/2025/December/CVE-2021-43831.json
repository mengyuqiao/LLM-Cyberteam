{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43831", "Description": "Gradio is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. In versions prior to 2.5.0 there is a vulnerability that affects anyone who creates and publicly shares Gradio interfaces. File paths are not restricted and users who receive a Gradio link can access any files on the host computer if they know the file names or file paths. This is limited only by the host operating system. Paths are opened in read only mode. The problem has been patched in gradio 2.5.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43831", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGradio Project\u00bbGradio\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 2.5.0cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "30.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  69.83%  30.34%  -39.48 \n 2  2025-03-29  30.34%  69.83%  +39.48 \n 3  2025-03-23  31.92%  30.34%  -1.57 \n 4  2025-03-17  2.79%  31.92%  +29.13 \n 5  2025-01-31  2.07%  2.79%  +0.72 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.51%  2.07%  +1.55 \n 7  2024-11-06  0.62%  0.51%  -0.11 \n 8  2024-06-17  0.06%  0.62%  +0.56 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-rhq2-3vr9-6mcr", "ref_desc": "Files on the host computer can be accessed from the Gradio interface \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/41bd3645bdb616e1248b2167ca83636a2653f781", "ref_desc": "secure path hotfix \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio@41bd364 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
