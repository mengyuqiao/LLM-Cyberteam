{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-42023", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in ModelSim Simulation (All versions), Questa Simulation (All versions). The RSA white-box implementation in affected applications insufficiently protects the built-in private keys that are required to decrypt electronic intellectual property (IP) data in accordance with the IEEE 1735 recommended practice. This could allow a sophisticated attacker to discover the keys, bypassing the protection intended by the IEEE 1735 recommended practice.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42023", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbModelsimcpe:2.3:a:siemens:modelsim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSiemens\u00bbQuestacpe:2.3:a:siemens:questa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.22%  0.14%  -0.07 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.14%  0.22%  +0.07 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.14%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-07-07  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-400332.pdf", "ref_desc": "Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
