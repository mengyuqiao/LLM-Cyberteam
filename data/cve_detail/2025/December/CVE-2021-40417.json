{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40417", "Description": "When parsing a file that is submitted to the DPDecoder service as a job, the service will use the combination of decoding parameters that were submitted with the job along with fields that were parsed for the submitted video by the R3D SDK to calculate the size of a heap buffer. Due to an integer overflow with regards to this calculation, this can result in an undersized heap buffer being allocated. When this heap buffer is written to, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur. This can result in code execution under the context of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40417", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nBlackmagicdesign\u00bbDavinci Resolve\u00bbVersion:17.3.1.0005cpe:2.3:a:blackmagicdesign:davinci_resolve:17.3.1.0005:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  4.21%  1.46%  -2.75 \n 2  2025-03-29  1.46%  4.21%  +2.75 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.48%  1.46%  +0.98 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.51%  0.48%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-11-27  0.48%  0.51%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-11-13  0.49%  0.48%  -0.01 \n 7  2024-10-02  0.44%  0.49%  +0.05 \n 8  2024-09-06  0.41%  0.44%  +0.03 \n 9  2024-07-28  0.35%  0.41%  +0.06 \n 10  2023-07-15  0.27%  0.35%  +0.07 \n 11  2023-06-04  0.25%  0.27%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.25%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-680 Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/680/Integer-Overflow-to-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1426", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2021-1426 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
