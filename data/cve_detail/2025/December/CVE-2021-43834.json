{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43834", "Description": "eLabFTW is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. In versions prior to 4.2.0 there is a vulnerability which allows an attacker to authenticate as an existing user, if that user was created using a single sign-on authentication option such as LDAP or SAML. It impacts instances where LDAP or SAML is used for authentication instead of the (default) local password mechanism. Users should upgrade to at least version 4.2.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43834", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nElabftw\u00bbElabftwVersions  before (<) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:elabftw:elabftw:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.59%  0.31%  -0.29 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.31%  0.59%  +0.29 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.33%  0.31%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-08-30  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-07-21  0.21%  0.30%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-28  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/security/advisories/GHSA-98rp-gx76-33ph", "ref_desc": "Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm in elabftw \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/4.2.0", "ref_desc": "Release eLabFTW-4.2.0 \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vgs2Klc_79oyC60oOLLNbh_PnK0.html"}]}
