{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43827", "Description": "discourse-footnote is a library providing footnotes for posts in Discourse. ### Impact When posting an inline footnote wrapped in `<a>` tags (e.g. `<a>^[footnote]</a>`, the resulting rendered HTML would include a nested `<a>`, which is stripped by Nokogiri because it is not valid. This then caused a javascript error on topic pages because we were looking for an `<a>` element inside the footnote reference span and getting its ID, and because it did not exist we got a null reference error in javascript. Users are advised to update to version 0.2. As a workaround editing offending posts from the rails console or the database console for self-hosters, or disabling the plugin in the admin panel can mitigate this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43827", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse Footnote\u00bbForDiscourseVersions  before (<) 0.2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse_footnote:*:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.32%  0.27%  -0.05 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.27%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.08%  0.27%  +0.19 \n 4  2023-07-07  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote/commit/796617e0131277011207541313522cd1946661ab", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Fix malicious footnote causing clientside errors (#27) \u00b7 discourse/discourse-footnote@796617e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote/security/advisories/GHSA-58vr-c56v-qr57", "ref_desc": "Malicious footnote markup may cause client side errors. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-footnote \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
