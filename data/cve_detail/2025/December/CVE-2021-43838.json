{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43838", "Description": "jsx-slack is a library for building JSON objects for Slack Block Kit surfaces from JSX. In versions prior to 4.5.1 users are vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack. If attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. jsx-slack v4.5.1 has patched to a regex for escaping blockquote characters. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43838", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nJsx-slack Project\u00bbJsx-slack\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.5.2cpe:2.3:a:jsx-slack_project:jsx-slack:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.38%  0.32%  -0.06 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.32%  0.38%  +0.06 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.32%  +0.22 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 5  2024-09-01  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-07-23  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-10  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-05-30  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security/advisories/GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in jsx-slack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yhatt/jsx-slack \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3iA9INBZnnp7xbg98_ZyMqTNyuc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/commit/36e4a10405e4c7745333e245fcc5029c02c7065d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q \u00b7 yhatt/jsx-slack@36e4a10 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
