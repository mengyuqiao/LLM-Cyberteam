{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34599", "Description": "Affected versions of CODESYS Git in Versions prior to V1.1.0.0 lack certificate validation in HTTPS handshakes. CODESYS Git does not implement certificate validation by default, so it does not verify that the server provides a valid and trusted HTTPS certificate. Since the certificate of the server to which the connection is made is not properly verified, the server connection is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34599", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCodesys\u00bbGITVersions  before (<) 1.1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:codesys:git:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Codesys\u00bbDevelopment System", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-13  0.13%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.19%  0.13%  -0.07 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.13%  0.19%  +0.07 \n 4  2025-03-20  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-08-16  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 7  2024-07-07  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 8  2023-06-24  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://customers.codesys.com/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=16959&token=3ce11e44a3277c4520d732ea2e630f2e06bd46ff&download", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
