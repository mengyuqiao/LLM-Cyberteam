It does not appear that normal users are intended to be able to manipulate configuration backups due to the fact that they are encrypted/obfuscated. By extracting the configuration using readily available public tools, a user can reconfigure settings not intended to be manipulated, repackage the configuration, and restore a backup causing these settings to be changed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45732", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetgear\u00bbR6700 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.0.4.120cpe:2.3:o:netgear:r6700_firmware:1.0.4.120:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Netgear\u00bbR6700\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.55%  0.28%  -0.27 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.28%  0.55%  +0.27 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.28%  +0.20 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-07-23  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-12  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-57", "ref_desc": "Netgear Nighthawk R6700 Multiple Vulnerabilities - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/r3aqLcgl6WtcpH-eOywhR4a8eKs.html"}]}
