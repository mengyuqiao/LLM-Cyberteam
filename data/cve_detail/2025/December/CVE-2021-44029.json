{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44029", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Quest KACE Desktop Authority before 11.2. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute remote code through a deserialization exploitation in the RadAsyncUpload function of ASP.NET AJAX. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability when the encryption keys are known (due to the presence of CVE-2017-11317, CVE-2017-11357, or other means). A default setting for the type whitelisting feature in more current versions of ASP.NET AJAX prevents exploitation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44029", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nQuest\u00bbKace Desktop AuthorityVersions  from including (>=) 10.0andbefore (<) 11.2cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.88% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.69%  0.88%  -0.82 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.88%  1.69%  +0.82 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.59%  0.88%  +0.29 \n 4  2025-01-08  0.83%  0.59%  -0.24 \n 5  2024-09-06  0.73%  0.83%  +0.10 \n 6  2024-02-01  0.59%  0.73%  +0.14 \n 7  2024-01-18  0.52%  0.59%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-11-21  0.26%  0.52%  +0.26 \n 9  2023-07-15  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-06-04  0.16%  0.25%  +0.09 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.quest.com/kace-desktop-authority/kb/336098/quest-response-to-desktop-authority-vulnerabilities-prior-to-11-2", "ref_desc": "Quest response to Desktop Authority vulnerabilities (prior to 11.2) (336098)Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HcFiD8YZIk5l5pJc9FgUfjnmy9U.html"}]}
