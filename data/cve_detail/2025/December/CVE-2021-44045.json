{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44045", "Description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists when reading a DGN file using Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.11. The specific issue exists within the parsing of DGN files. Crafted data in a DGN file and lack of proper validation for the XFAT sectors count can trigger a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44045", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpendesign\u00bbDrawings SdkVersions  before (<) 2022.11cpe:2.3:a:opendesign:drawings_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.61%  0.35%  -0.25 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.35%  0.61%  +0.25 \n 3  2025-03-25  0.33%  0.35%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.33%  +0.22 \n 5  2024-12-22  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-11-10  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-08-20  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-07-11  0.07%  0.12%  +0.06 \n 9  2024-05-06  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 10  2023-05-18  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-05-05  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 12  2023-03-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.06%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.opendesign.com/security-advisories", "ref_desc": "ODA Security Advisories | Open Design AllianceVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0nfh8pGQ_z9zByY3PmWDSBBErgk.html"}]}
