{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43823", "Description": "Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph prior to version 3.33.2 is vulnerable to a side-channel attack where strings in private source code could be guessed by an authenticated but unauthorized actor. This issue affects the Saved Searches and Code Monitoring features. A successful attack would require an authenticated bad actor to create many Saved Searches or Code Monitors to receive confirmation that a specific string exists. This could allow an attacker to guess formatted tokens in source code, such as API keys. This issue was patched in version 3.33.2 and any future versions of Sourcegraph. We strongly encourage upgrading to secure versions. If you are unable to, you may disable Saved Searches and Code Monitors.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43823", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSourcegraph\u00bbSourcegraphVersions  before (<) 3.33.2cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:sourcegraph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.25%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.48%  0.25%  -0.23 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.25%  0.48%  +0.23 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.25%  +0.20 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-07-06  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-05-26  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/commit/a88d90a8302c492282186d39718cd8fb093c14fa", "ref_desc": "search: use exclude filters when resolving global private repos (#27501) \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph@a88d90a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-cpq7-hmvv-29w9", "ref_desc": "Side-channel attack in Sourcegraph \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
