{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43781", "Description": "Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43781", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nInveniosoftware\u00bbInvenio-drafts-resourcesVersions  before (<) 0.13.7cpe:2.3:a:inveniosoftware:invenio-drafts-resources:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nInveniosoftware\u00bbInvenio-drafts-resourcesVersions  from including (>=) 0.14.0andbefore (<) 0.14.6cpe:2.3:a:inveniosoftware:invenio-drafts-resources:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-01  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.12%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.12%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-06-29  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-drafts-resources/security/advisories/GHSA-xr38-w74q-r8jv", "ref_desc": "Permissions not properly checked when a record is published. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 inveniosoftware/invenio-drafts-resources \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-drafts-resources/commit/039b0cff1ad4b952000f4d8c3a93f347108b6626", "ref_desc": "security: fix missing permission check of publish \u00b7 inveniosoftware/invenio-drafts-resources@039b0cf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
