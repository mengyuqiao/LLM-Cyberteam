{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44518", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the eGeeTouch 3rd Generation Travel Padlock application for Android. The lock sends a pairing code before each operation (lock or unlock) activated via the companion app. The code is sent unencrypted, allowing any attacker with the same app (either Android or iOS) to add the lock and take complete control. For successful exploitation, the attacker must be able to touch the lock's power button, and must be able to capture BLE network communication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44518", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDigipas\u00bbEgeetouch Manager\u00bbVersion:N/AForAndroidcpe:2.3:a:digipas:egeetouch_manager:-:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-08-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-25  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ashallen.net/the-egeetouch-tsa-smart-lock-is-anything-but", "ref_desc": "The eGeeTouch TSA Smart Lock is Anything But \u2013 Ash Allen \u2013 SecurityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
