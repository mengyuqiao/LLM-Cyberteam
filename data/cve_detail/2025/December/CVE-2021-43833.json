{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43833", "Description": "eLabFTW is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. In versions prior to 4.2.0 there is a vulnerability which allows any authenticated user to gain access to arbitrary accounts by setting a specially crafted email address. This vulnerability impacts all instances that have not set an explicit email domain name allowlist. Note that whereas neither administrators nor targeted users are notified of a change, an attacker will need to control an account. The default settings require administrators to validate newly created accounts. The problem has been patched. Users should upgrade to at least version 4.2.0. For users unable to upgrade enabling an email domain allow list (from Sysconfig panel, Security tab) will completely resolve the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43833", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nElabftw\u00bbElabftwVersions  before (<) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:elabftw:elabftw:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.48%  0.24%  -0.23 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.24%  0.48%  +0.23 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.21%  +0.09 \n 5  2024-12-03  0.10%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/security/advisories/GHSA-v659-q2fh-v99w", "ref_desc": "Account takeover vulnerability in eLabFTW \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/4.2.0", "ref_desc": "Release eLabFTW-4.2.0 \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vgs2Klc_79oyC60oOLLNbh_PnK0.html"}]}
