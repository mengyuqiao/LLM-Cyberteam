{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43802", "Description": "Etherpad is a real-time collaborative editor. In versions prior to 1.8.16, an attacker can craft an `*.etherpad` file that, when imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records). The problem has been fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/*/import`, which will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports; limit all users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state. More detailed information and general mitigation strategies may be found in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43802", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nEtherpad\u00bbEtherpadVersions  before (<) 1.8.16cpe:2.3:a:etherpad:etherpad:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.52%  0.55%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-03-30  1.38%  0.52%  -0.86 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.52%  1.38%  +0.86 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.18%  0.52%  +0.34 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-08-29  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-07-31  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-07-17  0.15%  0.12%  -0.03 \n 9  2023-07-02  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-16  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 11  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.14%  -2.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-790 Improper Filtering of Special Elements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/790/Improper-Filtering-of-Special-Elements.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1287 Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1287/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Type-of-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/compare/b7065eb9a0ec7c3c265f8cfeb2534efe6f036456...77bcb507b30e762e9375b0511b3763e0162aae53", "ref_desc": "Comparing b7065eb9a0ec7c3c265f8cfeb2534efe6f036456...77bcb507b30e762e9375b0511b3763e0162aae53 \u00b7 ether/etherpad-lite \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/releases/tag/1.8.16", "ref_desc": "Release 1.8.16 \u00b7 ether/etherpad-lite \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/security/advisories/GHSA-w3g3-qf3g-2mqc", "ref_desc": "Admin privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution via malicious *.etherpad imports \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ether/etherpad-lite \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/5010", "ref_desc": "Sessionstorage is constantly growing \u00b7 Issue #5010 \u00b7 ether/etherpad-lite \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
