{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43811", "Description": "Sockeye is an open-source sequence-to-sequence framework for Neural Machine Translation built on PyTorch. Sockeye uses YAML to store model and data configurations on disk. Versions below 2.3.24 use unsafe YAML loading, which can be made to execute arbitrary code embedded in config files. An attacker can add malicious code to the config file of a trained model and attempt to convince users to download and run it. If users run the model, the embedded code will run locally. The issue is fixed in version 2.3.24.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43811", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbSockeye\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 2.3.24cpe:2.3:a:amazon:sockeye:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "9.82% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-03  9.38%  9.82%  +0.45 \n 2  2025-03-30  33.20%  9.38%  -23.82 \n 3  2025-03-29  9.38%  33.20%  +23.82 \n 4  2025-03-28  33.20%  9.38%  -23.82 \n 5  2025-03-27  23.54%  33.20%  +9.66 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.49%  23.54%  +23.05 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.49%  +0.30 \n 8  2024-11-13  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 9  2024-08-23  0.15%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 10  2024-07-14  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 11  2024-06-18  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-07-30  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 13  2023-07-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 14  2023-07-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 15  2023-05-21  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 16  2023-03-07  1.56%  0.07%  -1.49 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye/pull/964", "ref_desc": "Use safe yaml loader by tdomhan \u00b7 Pull Request #964 \u00b7 awslabs/sockeye \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye/releases/tag/2.3.24", "ref_desc": "Release 2.3.24 \u00b7 awslabs/sockeye \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye/security/advisories/GHSA-ggmr-44cv-24pm", "ref_desc": "Code injection via unsafe YAML loading \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 awslabs/sockeye \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
