{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43890", "Description": "We have investigated reports of a spoofing vulnerability in AppX installer that affects Microsoft Windows. Microsoft is aware of attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability by using specially crafted packages that include the malware family known as Emotet/Trickbot/Bazaloader.\nAn attacker could craft a malicious attachment to be used in phishing campaigns. The attacker would then have to convince the user to open the specially crafted attachment. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\nPlease see the Security Updates table for the link to the updated app. Alternatively you can download and install the Installer using the links provided in the FAQ section.\nPlease see the Mitigations and Workaround sections for important information about steps you can take to protect your system from this vulnerability.\nDecember 27 2023 Update:\nIn recent months, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has seen an increase in activity from threat actors leveraging social engineering and phishing techniques to target Windows OS users and utilizing the ms-appinstaller URI scheme.\nTo address this increase in activity, we have updated the App Installer to disable the ms-appinstaller protocol by default and recommend other potential mitigations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43890", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbApp InstallerVersions  before (<) 1.11cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:app_installer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 1507\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 1709\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 1803\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMicrosoft\u00bbApp InstallerVersions  before (<) 1.16cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:app_installer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 1809\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 1903\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 1909\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 2004\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 20h2\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 21h1\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10 21h2\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 11 21h2\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "14.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  53.89%  14.93%  -38.95 \n 2  2025-03-29  14.93%  53.89%  +38.95 \n 3  2025-03-17  27.25%  14.93%  -12.32 \n 4  2025-01-17  32.00%  27.25%  -4.75 \n 5  2024-12-18  36.98%  32.00%  -4.98 \n 6  2024-12-17  13.15%  36.98%  +23.83 \n 7  2024-08-17  13.12%  13.15%  +0.04 \n 8  2024-07-25  0.17%  13.12%  +12.95 \n 9  2023-12-30  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-12-28  0.20%  0.15%  -0.05 \n 11  2023-11-01  0.25%  0.20%  -0.05 \n 12  2023-07-08  0.27%  0.25%  -0.01 \n 13  2023-05-28  0.23%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 14  2023-05-15  0.21%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 15  2023-04-18  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 16  2023-04-04  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 17  2023-03-07  1.15%  0.16%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/microsoft-disables-msix-app-installer.html", "ref_desc": "Microsoft Disables MSIX App Installer Protocol Widely Used in Malware AttacksPress/Media Coverage;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil/pull/26", "ref_desc": "Added Winget Check and Install by mrhaydendp \u00b7 Pull Request #26 \u00b7 ChrisTitusTech/winutil \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-43890", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-43890 - Security Update Guide - Microsoft - Windows AppX Installer Spoofing VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-disables-msix-protocol-handler-abused-in-malware-attacks/", "ref_desc": "Microsoft disables MSIX protocol handler abused in malware attacksPress/Media Coverage;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/12/28/financially-motivated-threat-actors-misusing-app-installer/", "ref_desc": "Financially motivated threat actors misusing App Installer | Microsoft Security BlogExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
