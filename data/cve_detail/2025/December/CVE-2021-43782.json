{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43782", "Description": "Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. This is a follow up to GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm/CVE-2021-41276, the initial fix was incomplete. Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. The following versions contain the fix: Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.83, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43782", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnalean\u00bbTuleap\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  before (<) 13.2.99.83cpe:2.3:a:enalean:tuleap:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnalean\u00bbTuleap\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 13.2-1andbefore (<) 13.2-4cpe:2.3:a:enalean:tuleap:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnalean\u00bbTuleap\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 13.1-1andbefore (<) 13.1-6cpe:2.3:a:enalean:tuleap:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  2.55%  1.33%  -1.22 \n 2  2025-03-29  1.33%  2.55%  +1.22 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.31%  1.33%  +1.02 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.31%  +0.09 \n 5  2023-08-06  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-07-23  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-22  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.16%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-90 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/90/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-LDAP-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/security/advisories/GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm", "ref_desc": "Indirect LDAP injection via the ldap_id attribute of a user \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Enalean/tuleap \u00b7 GitHubNot Applicable;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-17QoWKvFawUverSM4ofqJjtKyE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tuleap.net/plugins/git/tuleap/tuleap/stable?a=commit&h=64e77561eba9f8233199c2962b3497ed7294a7d2", "ref_desc": "Git - TuleapPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tuleap.net/plugins/tracker/?aid=24168", "ref_desc": "Indirect LDAP injection via the ldap_id attribute of a user when - request #24168 - Requests - TuleapIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/security/advisories/GHSA-cwv9-hhm4-jr84", "ref_desc": "Indirect LDAP injection via the ldap_id attribute of a user when checking if it exists \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Enalean/tuleap \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/commit/64e77561eba9f8233199c2962b3497ed7294a7d2", "ref_desc": "request #24168: Indirect LDAP injection via the ldap_id attribute of \u2026 \u00b7 Enalean/tuleap@64e7756 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
