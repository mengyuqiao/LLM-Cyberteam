{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33430", "Description": "A Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in NumPy 1.9.x in the PyArray_NewFromDescr_int function of ctors.c when specifying arrays of large dimensions (over 32) from Python code, which could let a malicious user cause a Denial of Service. NOTE: The vendor does not agree this is a vulneraility; In (very limited) circumstances a user may be able provoke the buffer overflow, the user is most likely already privileged to at least provoke denial of service by exhausting memory. Triggering this further requires the use of uncommon API (complicated structured dtypes), which is very unlikely to be available to an unprivileged user", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33430", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNumpy\u00bbNumpyVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.9.3cpe:2.3:a:numpy:numpy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-05-07  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 3  2025-04-19  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-30  0.25%  0.11%  -0.14 \n 5  2025-03-29  0.11%  0.25%  +0.14 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.11%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 8  2024-02-08  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-07-10  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18939", "ref_desc": "Potential buffer overflow in PyArray_NewFromDescr_int of ctors.c \u00b7 Issue #18939 \u00b7 numpy/numpy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
