{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43817", "Description": "Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology. In affected versions a reflected XSS vulnerability was found in Collabora Online. An attacker could inject unescaped HTML into a variable as they created the Collabora Online iframe, and execute scripts inside the context of the Collabora Online iframe. This would give access to a small set of user settings stored in the browser, as well as the session's authentication token which was also passed in at iframe creation time. Users should upgrade to Collabora Online 6.4.16 or higher or Collabora Online 4.2.20 or higher. Collabora Online Development Edition 21.11 is not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43817", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCollabora\u00bbOnlineVersions  before (<) 4.2.20cpe:2.3:a:collabora:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCollabora\u00bbOnlineVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.0andbefore (<) 6.4.16cpe:2.3:a:collabora:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.21%  0.18%  -0.03 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.21%  +0.15 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-08-28  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-06  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-05-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/security/advisories/GHSA-7f6h-v9mx-58q9", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-43817: Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CollaboraOnline/online \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
