{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44599", "Description": "The id parameter from Online Enrollment Management System 1.0 system appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A crafted payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. The attacker can retrieve sensitive information for all users of this system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44599", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nOnline Enrollment Management System Project\u00bbOnline Enrollment Management System\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:online_enrollment_management_system_project:online_enrollment_management_system:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.49%  0.25%  -0.24 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.25%  0.49%  +0.24 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-11-14  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-09-07  0.22%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 7  2024-07-29  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-07-16  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-06-05  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/tree/main/vendors/janobe/Online-Enrollment-Management-System", "ref_desc": "CVE-nu11secur1ty/vendors/janobe/Online-Enrollment-Management-System at main \u00b7 nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mcEcAYrbHzkHVZJUt62Hj_K4vh4.html"}]}
