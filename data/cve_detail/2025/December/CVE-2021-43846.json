{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43846", "Description": "`solidus_frontend` is the cart and storefront for the Solidus e-commerce project. Versions of `solidus_frontend` prior to 3.1.5, 3.0.5, and 2.11.14 contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows a malicious site to add an item to the user's cart without their knowledge. Versions 3.1.5, 3.0.5, and 2.11.14 contain a patch for this issue. The patch adds CSRF token verification to the \"Add to cart\" action. Adding forgery protection to a form that missed it can have some side effects. Other CSRF protection strategies as well as a workaround involving modifcation to config/application.rb` are available. More details on these mitigations are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43846", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNebulab\u00bbSolidusVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.0andbefore (<) 3.1.5cpe:2.3:a:nebulab:solidus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNebulab\u00bbSolidusVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.5cpe:2.3:a:nebulab:solidus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNebulab\u00bbSolidusVersions  before (<) 2.11.14cpe:2.3:a:nebulab:solidus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.12%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 5  2024-07-26  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-13  0.08%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-07-13  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-06-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/4d17cacf066d9492fc04eb3a0b16084b47376d81", "ref_desc": "Protect `Spree::OrdersController#populate` against CSRF attacks \u00b7 solidusio/solidus@4d17cac \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/a1b9bf7f24f9b8684fc4d943eacb02b1926c77c6", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-h3fg-h5v3-vf8m \u00b7 solidusio/solidus@a1b9bf7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/security/advisories/GHSA-h3fg-h5v3-vf8m", "ref_desc": "CSRF forgery protection bypass for Spree::OrdersController#populate \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 solidusio/solidus \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
