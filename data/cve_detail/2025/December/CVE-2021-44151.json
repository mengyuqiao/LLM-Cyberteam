{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44151", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. As the session cookies are small, an attacker can hijack any existing sessions by bruteforcing the 4 hex-character session cookie on the Windows version (the Linux version appears to have 8 characters). An attacker can obtain the static part of the cookie (cookie name) by first making a request to any page on the application (e.g., /goforms/menu) and saving the name of the cookie sent with the response. The attacker can then use the name of the cookie and try to request that same page, setting a random value for the cookie. If any user has an active session, the page should return with the authorized content, when a valid cookie value is hit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44151", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nReprisesoftware\u00bbReprise License ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 14.2andbefore (<) 15.1cpe:2.3:a:reprisesoftware:reprise_license_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  6.78%  0.40%  -6.38 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.40%  6.78%  +6.38 \n 3  2025-03-24  2.52%  0.40%  -2.12 \n 4  2025-03-23  0.40%  2.52%  +2.12 \n 5  2025-03-20  0.40%  0.40%  +0.00 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.36%  0.40%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.36%  +0.10 \n 8  2024-08-28  0.28%  0.26%  -0.02 \n 9  2024-07-19  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 10  2024-06-23  0.26%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 11  2024-05-27  0.21%  0.26%  +0.05 \n 12  2023-07-05  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 13  2023-05-25  0.33%  0.22%  -0.11 \n 14  2023-05-08  0.26%  0.33%  +0.07 \n 15  2023-04-21  0.24%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 16  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165191/Reprise-License-Manager-14.2-Session-Hijacking.html", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.reprisesoftware.com/RELEASE_NOTES", "ref_desc": "Broken LinkCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bfg_f60oUpHB9_1D8Rclt0IyXvQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://reprisesoftware.com/admin/rlm-admin-download.php?&euagree=yes", "ref_desc": "License Administration Bundle Downloads: Reprise License Manager - RLMProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/irPsJHSvRq7cUOH_c5yWP81Kk4c.html"}]}
