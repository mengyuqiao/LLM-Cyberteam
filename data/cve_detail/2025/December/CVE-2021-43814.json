{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43814", "Description": "Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. In versions up to and including 0.3.1 there is a heap-based out of bounds write in parse_die() when reversing an AMD64 ELF binary with DWARF debug info. When a malicious AMD64 ELF binary is opened by a victim user, Rizin may crash or execute unintended actions. No workaround are known and users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43814", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nRizin\u00bbRizinVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.3.1cpe:2.3:a:rizin:rizin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-08  0.33%  0.35%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-04-07  0.13%  0.33%  +0.21 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.31%  0.13%  -0.19 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.13%  0.31%  +0.19 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-08-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-07-19  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 9  2024-06-23  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-07-21  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-07-06  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 12  2023-05-26  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/security/advisories/GHSA-hqqp-vjcm-mw8r", "ref_desc": "Heap-based OOB write when parsing dwarf DIE info in Rizin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rizinorg/rizin \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/aa6917772d2f32e5a7daab25a46c72df0b5ea406", "ref_desc": "Fix oob write for dwarf with abbrev with count 0 (Fix #2083) (#2086) \u00b7 rizinorg/rizin@aa69177 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/2083", "ref_desc": "Heap-based OOB write when parsing dwarf die info \u00b7 Issue #2083 \u00b7 rizinorg/rizin \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
