{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43835", "Description": "Sulu is an open-source PHP content management system based on the Symfony framework. In affected versions Sulu users who have access to any subset of the admin UI are able to elevate their privilege. Over the API it was possible for them to give themselves permissions to areas which they did not already had. This issue was introduced in 2.0.0-RC1 with the new ProfileController putAction. The versions have been patched in 2.2.18, 2.3.8 and 2.4.0. For users unable to upgrade the only known workaround is to apply a patch to the ProfileController manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43835", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSulu\u00bbSuluVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.8cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSulu\u00bbSuluVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.18cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSulu\u00bbSulu\u00bbVersion:2.4.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:2.4.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.59%  0.30%  -0.29 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.30%  0.59%  +0.29 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.30%  +0.20 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-28  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sulu/sulu/commit/30bf8b5a4f83b6f2171a696011757d095edaa28a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-84px-q68r-2fc9 \u00b7 sulu/sulu@30bf8b5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sulu/sulu/security/advisories/GHSA-84px-q68r-2fc9", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation in the Sulu Admin panel \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sulu/sulu \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
