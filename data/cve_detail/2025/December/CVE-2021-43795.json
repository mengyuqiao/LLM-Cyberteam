{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43795", "Description": "Armeria is an open source microservice framework. In affected versions an attacker can access an Armeria server's local file system beyond its restricted directory by sending an HTTP request whose path contains `%2F` (encoded `/`), such as `/files/..%2Fsecrets.txt`, bypassing Armeria's path validation logic. Armeria 1.13.4 or above contains the hardened path validation logic that handles `%2F` properly. This vulnerability can be worked around by inserting a decorator that performs an additional validation on the request path.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43795", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nLinecorp\u00bbArmeriaVersions  before (<) 1.13.4cpe:2.3:a:linecorp:armeria:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.75% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-28  0.72%  0.75%  +0.04 \n 2  2025-03-30  1.38%  0.72%  -0.67 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.72%  1.38%  +0.67 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.13%  0.72%  +0.59 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.13%  -0.05 \n 6  2024-08-17  0.17%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-07-08  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-06-25  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 9  2023-05-15  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/line/armeria/pull/3855", "ref_desc": "Exclude `%2F(/)` from decoding of percents in a request path. by ikhoon \u00b7 Pull Request #3855 \u00b7 line/armeria \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/line/armeria/security/advisories/GHSA-8fp4-rp6c-5gcv", "ref_desc": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in com.linecorp.armeria:armeria \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 line/armeria \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/line/armeria/commit/e2697a575e9df6692b423e02d731f293c1313284", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8fp4-rp6c-5gcv \u00b7 line/armeria@e2697a5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
