{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43849", "Description": "cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio is a plugin provides a single and simple interface for accessing fingerprint APIs on both Android 6+ and iOS. In versions prior to 5.0.1 The exported activity `de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity` can cause the app to crash. This vulnerability occurred because the activity didn't handle the case where it is requested with invalid or empty data which results in a crash. Any third party app can constantly call this activity with no permission. A 3rd party app/attacker using event listener can continually stop the app from working and make the victim unable to open it. Version 5.0.1 of the cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio doesn't export the activity anymore and is no longer vulnerable. If you want to fix older versions change the attribute android:exported in plugin.xml to false. Please upgrade to version 5.0.1 as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43849", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCordova Plugin Fingerprint All-in-one Project\u00bbCordova Plugin Fingerprint All-in-one\u00bb     Node.jsEditionVersions  before (<) 5.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cordova_plugin_fingerprint_all-in-one_project:cordova_plugin_fingerprint_all-in-one:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbIphone Os\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Google\u00bbAndroid", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-07-16  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio/releases/tag/v5.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release v5.0.1 \u00b7 NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio/security/advisories/GHSA-7vfx-hfvm-rhr8", "ref_desc": "Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability on Android \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio/commit/27434a240f97f69fd930088654590c8ba43569df", "ref_desc": "Update Fingerprint.swift \u00b7 NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio@27434a2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
