{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27092", "Description": "GHOSTS is an open source user simulation framework for cyber experimentation, simulation, training, and exercise. A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0 that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory through the photo retrieval endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the /api/npcs/{id}/photo endpoint, which is designed to serve profile photos for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) but fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths. When an NPC is created with a specially crafted photoLink value containing path traversal sequences (../, ..\\, etc.), the application processes these sequences without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to traverse directory structures and access files outside of the intended photo directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files. The vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process, which could include configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data. This issue has been addressed in version 8.2.7.90 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27092", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCMU\u00bbGhostsVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.2.7.90cpe:2.3:a:cmu:ghosts:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.05%  -0.04 \n 3  2025-02-28  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cmu-sei/GHOSTS/security/advisories/GHSA-qr67-m6w9-wj3j", "ref_desc": "[XBOW-025-109] Path Traversal Vulnerability in GHOSTS API 8.x Photo Retrieval Endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cmu-sei/GHOSTS \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory;Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cmu-sei/GHOSTS/commit/e69827556a52ff813de00e1017c4b62598d2c887", "ref_desc": "Mitigates directory traversal [XBOW-025-109] \u00b7 cmu-sei/GHOSTS@e698275 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
