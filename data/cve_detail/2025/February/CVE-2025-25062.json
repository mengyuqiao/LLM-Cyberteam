{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25062", "Description": "An XSS issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.28.x before 1.28.5 and 1.29.x before 1.29.3. It doesn't sufficiently isolate long text content when the CKEditor 5 rich text editor is used. This allows a potential attacker to craft specialized HTML and JavaScript that may be executed when an administrator attempts to edit a piece of content. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the ability to create long text content (such as through the node or comment forms) and an administrator must edit (not view) the content that contains the malicious content. This problem only exists when using the CKEditor 5 module.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25062", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "31.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  20.51%  31.48%  +10.97 \n 2  2025-03-28  24.39%  20.51%  -3.88 \n 3  2025-03-27  31.48%  24.39%  -7.09 \n 4  2025-03-26  26.13%  31.48%  +5.35 \n 5  2025-03-24  19.82%  26.13%  +6.32 \n 6  2025-03-23  16.46%  19.82%  +3.35 \n 7  2025-03-20  26.13%  16.46%  -9.67 \n 8  2025-03-17  0.05%  26.13%  +26.08 \n 9  2025-02-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2025-001", "ref_desc": "Backdrop core - Moderately Critical - CKEditor 5 Cross Site Scripting - BACKDROP-SA-CORE-2025-001 | Backdrop CMS", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
