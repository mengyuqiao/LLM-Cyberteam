{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21823", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbatman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker\n\nThe ELP worker needs to calculate new metric values for all neighbors\n\"reachable\" over an interface. Some of the used metric sources require\nlocks which might need to sleep. This sleep is incompatible with the RCU\nlist iterator used for the recorded neighbors. The initial approach to work\naround of this problem was to queue another work item per neighbor and then\nrun this in a new context.\n\nEven when this solved the RCU vs might_sleep() conflict, it has a major\nproblems: Nothing was stopping the work item in case it is not needed\nanymore - for example because one of the related interfaces was removed or\nthe batman-adv module was unloaded - resulting in potential invalid memory\naccesses.\n\nDirectly canceling the metric worker also has various problems:\n\n* cancel_work_sync for a to-be-deactivated interface is called with\n  rtnl_lock held. But the code in the ELP metric worker also tries to use\n  rtnl_lock() - which will never return in this case. This also means that\n  cancel_work_sync would never return because it is waiting for the worker\n  to finish.\n* iterating over the neighbor list for the to-be-deactivated interface is\n  currently done using the RCU specific methods. Which means that it is\n  possible to miss items when iterating over it without the associated\n  spinlock - a behaviour which is acceptable for a periodic metric check\n  but not for a cleanup routine (which must \"stop\" all still running\n  workers)\n\nThe better approch is to get rid of the per interface neighbor metric\nworker and handle everything in the interface worker. The original problems\nare solved by:\n\n* creating a list of neighbors which require new metric information inside\n  the RCU protected context, gathering the metric according to the new list\n  outside the RCU protected context\n* only use rcu_trylock inside metric gathering code to avoid a deadlock\n  when the cancel_delayed_work_sync is called in the interface removal code\n  (which is called with the rtnl_lock held)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21823", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3c0e0aecb78cb2a2ca1dc701982d08fedb088dc6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a0019971f340ae02ba54cf1861f72da7e03e6b66", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0fdc3c166ac17b26014313fa2b93696354511b24", "ref_desc": "batman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c334629176c2d644befc31a20d4bf75542f7631", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8c8ecc98f5c65947b0070a24bac11e12e47cc65d", "ref_desc": "batman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a7aa2317285806640c844acd4cd2cd768e395264", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/af264c2a9adc37f4bdf88ca7f3affa15d8c7de9e", "ref_desc": "batman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/781a06fd265a8151f7601122d9c2e985663828ff", "ref_desc": "batman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
