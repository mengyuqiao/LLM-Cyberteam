{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24032", "Description": "PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate based user login. Prior to version 0.6.13, if cert_policy is set to none (the default value), then pam_pkcs11 will only check if the user is capable of logging into the token. An attacker may create a different token with the user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known to the attacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then the attacker may now login as user with that created token. The default to *not* check the private key's signature has been changed with commit commi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versions starting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected. As a workaround, in `pam_pkcs11.conf`, set at least `cert_policy = signature;`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24032", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.11%  0.19%  +0.08 \n 2  2025-03-28  0.19%  0.11%  -0.08 \n 3  2025-03-27  0.11%  0.19%  +0.08 \n 4  2025-03-21  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/commit/d9530167966a77115db6e885d459382a2e52ee9e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/commit/470263258d1ac59c5eade439c4d9caba0097e6e6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/security/advisories/GHSA-8r8p-7mgp-vf56", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00021.html", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/commit/b665b287ff955bbbd9539252ff9f9e2754c3fb48", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/releases/tag/pam_pkcs11-0.6.13", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
