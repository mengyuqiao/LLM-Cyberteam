{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27410", "Description": "PwnDoc is a penetration test reporting application. Prior to version 1.2.0, the backup restore functionality is vulnerable to path traversal in the TAR entry's name, allowing an attacker to overwrite any file on the system with their content. By overwriting an included `.js` file and restarting the container, this allows for Remote Code Execution as an administrator. The remote code execution occurs because any user with the `backups:create` and `backups:update` (only administrators by default) is able to overwrite any file on the system. Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27410", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "3.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-26  1.82%  3.18%  +1.36 \n 2  2025-03-25  1.36%  1.82%  +0.45 \n 3  2025-03-23  0.28%  1.36%  +1.09 \n 4  2025-03-20  0.12%  0.28%  +0.15 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.12%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.2.0 \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5pGlcgDDb9cFbAYUPE1ql_4Bwnc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/security/advisories/GHSA-mxw8-vgvx-89hx", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Write to RCE using Path Traversal in backup restore as admin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/blob/14acb704891245bf1703ce6296d62112e85aa995/backend/src/routes/backup.js#L527", "ref_desc": "pwndoc/backend/src/routes/backup.js at 14acb704891245bf1703ce6296d62112e85aa995 \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/commit/98f284291d73d3a0b11d3181d845845c192d1080", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc@98f2842 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
