{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24366", "Description": "SFTPGo is an open source, event-driven file transfer solution. SFTPGo supports execution of a defined set of commands via SSH. Besides a set of default commands some optional commands can be activated, one of them being `rsync`. It is disabled in the default configuration and it is limited to the local filesystem, it does not work with cloud/remote storage backends. Due to missing sanitization of the client provided `rsync` command, an authenticated remote user can use some options of the rsync command to read or write files with the permissions of the SFTPGo server process. This issue was fixed in version v2.6.5 by checking the client provided arguments. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24366", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.24%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.24%  +0.20 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/security/advisories/GHSA-vj7w-3m8c-6vpx", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/b347ab6051f6c501da205c09315fe99cd1fa3ba1", "ref_desc": "rsync: enforce a supported format and limit the allowed options \u00b7 drakkan/sftpgo@b347ab6 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
