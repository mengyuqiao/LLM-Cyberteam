{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27112", "Description": "Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. Starting in version 0.52.0 and prior to version 0.54.5, in certain Subsonic API endpoints, a flaw in the authentication check process allows an attacker to specify any arbitrary username that does not exist on the system, along with a salted hash of an empty password. Under these conditions, Navidrome treats the request as authenticated, granting access to various Subsonic endpoints without requiring valid credentials. An attacker can use any non-existent username to bypass the authentication system and gain access to various read-only data in Navidrome, such as user playlists. However, any attempt to modify data fails with a \"permission denied\" error due to insufficient permissions, limiting the impact to unauthorized viewing of information. Version 0.54.5 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27112", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNavidrome\u00bbNavidrome\u00bbForGOVersions  from including (>=) 0.52.0andbefore (<) 0.54.5cpe:2.3:a:navidrome:navidrome:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "5.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-28  4.97%  5.38%  +0.40 \n 2  2025-03-24  3.72%  4.97%  +1.26 \n 3  2025-03-23  4.97%  3.72%  -1.26 \n 4  2025-03-18  3.72%  4.97%  +1.26 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.92%  3.72%  +2.80 \n 6  2025-03-05  0.05%  0.92%  +0.87 \n 7  2025-02-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/security/advisories/GHSA-c3p4-vm8f-386p", "ref_desc": "Authentication bypass in Subsonic API with non-existent username \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 navidrome/navidrome \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/commit/287079a9e409fb6b9708ca384d7daa7b5185c1a0", "ref_desc": "sec(subsonic): authentication bypass in Subsonic API with non-existen\u2026 \u00b7 navidrome/navidrome@287079a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
