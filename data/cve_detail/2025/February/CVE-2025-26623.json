{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-26623", "Description": "Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fixiso`. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26623", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-22  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-20  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.10%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/3168", "ref_desc": "Use after free error when calling API `Exiv2::TiffParser::encode` \u00b7 Issue #3168 \u00b7 Exiv2/exiv2", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-38h4-fx85-qcx7", "ref_desc": "Use After Free in Exiv2 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Exiv2/exiv2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
