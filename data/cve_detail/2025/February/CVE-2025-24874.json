{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24874", "Description": "SAP Commerce (Backoffice) uses the deprecated X-FRAME-OPTIONS header to protect against clickjacking. While this protection remains effective now, it may not be the case in the future as browsers might discontinue support for this header in favor of the frame-ancestors CSP directive. Hence, clickjacking could become possible then, and lead to exposure and modification of sensitive information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24874", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1021 Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1021/Improper-Restriction-of-Rendered-UI-Layers-or-Frames.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://me.sap.com/notes/3559510", "ref_desc": "SAP for Me: Sign In", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://url.sap/sapsecuritypatchday", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Notes & NewsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rLkoWfUarlCkanLwjmA-fd6W-20.html"}]}
