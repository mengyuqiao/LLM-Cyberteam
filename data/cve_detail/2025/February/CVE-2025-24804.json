{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24804", "Description": "Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework. According to Apple's documentation for bundle ID's, it must contain only alphanumeric characters (A\u2013Z, a\u2013z, and 0\u20139), hyphens (-), and periods (.). However, an attacker can manually modify this value in the `Info.plist` file and add special characters to the `<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>` value. When the application parses the wrong characters in the bundle ID, it encounters an error. As a result, it will not display content and will throw a 500 error instead. The only way to make the pages work again is to manually remove the malicious application from the system. This issue has been addressed in version 4.3.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24804", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.11%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1287 Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1287/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Type-of-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/05206e72cae35b311615a70e51e1a946955c5e83", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Tnygrw0EO0rQTXhtjKP-Jig8Y4o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/cfbundleidentifier", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zLXvYVwtahGb7k_ClpF7jUz58YU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-jrm8-xgf3-fwqr", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
