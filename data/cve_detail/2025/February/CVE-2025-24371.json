{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24371", "Description": "CometBFT is a distributed, Byzantine fault-tolerant, deterministic state machine replication engine. In the `blocksync` protocol peers send their `base` and `latest` heights when they connect to a new node (`A`), which is syncing to the tip of a network. `base` acts as a lower ground and informs `A` that the peer only has blocks starting from height `base`. `latest` height informs `A` about the latest block in a network. Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights. If `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest` height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights. The existing code however doesn't check for the case where `B` first reports `latest` height `X` and immediately after height `Y`, where `X > Y`. `A` will be trying to catch up to 2000 indefinitely. This condition requires the introduction of malicious code in the full node first reporting some non-existing `latest` height, then reporting lower `latest` height and nodes which are syncing using `blocksync` protocol. This issue has been patched in versions 1.0.1 and 0.38.17 and all users are advised to upgrade. Operators may attempt to ban malicious peers from the network as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24371", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/703/Improper-Check-or-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-22qq-3xwm-r5x4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
