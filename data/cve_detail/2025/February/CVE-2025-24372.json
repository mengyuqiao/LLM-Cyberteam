{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24372", "Description": "CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data portals. Using a specially crafted file, a user could potentially upload a file containing code that when executed could send arbitrary requests to the server. If that file was opened by an administrator, it could lead to escalation of privileges of the original submitter or other malicious actions. Users must have been registered to the site to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been fixed in CKAN 2.10.7 and 2.11.2. Users are advised to upgrade. On versions prior to CKAN 2.10.7 and 2.11.2, site maintainers can restrict the file types supported for uploading using the `ckan.upload.user.mimetypes` / `ckan.upload.user.types` and `ckan.upload.group.mimetypes` / `ckan.upload.group.types` config options. To entirely disable file uploads users can use: `ckan.upload.user.types = none`", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24372", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#ckan-upload-group-types", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#ckan-upload-user-types", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#ckan-upload-group-mimetypes", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/7da6a26c6183e0a97a356d1b1d2407f3ecc7b9c8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html#ckan-upload-user-mimetypes", "ref_desc": "Configuration Options \u2014 CKAN 2.12.0a0 documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-7pq5-qcp6-mcww", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
