{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25193", "Description": "Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a vulnerability in versions up to and including 4.1.118.Final. An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as CVE-2024-47535. This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25193", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNetty\u00bbNettyVersions  before (<) 4.1.118cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-27  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0006/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2025-25193 Apache Netty Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-839f-4rhx", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
