{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25285", "Description": "@octokit/endpoint turns REST API endpoints into generic request options. Starting in version 4.1.0 and prior to version 10.1.3, by crafting specific `options` parameters, the `endpoint.parse(options)` call can be triggered, leading to a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack. This causes the program to hang and results in high CPU utilization. The issue occurs in the `parse` function within the `parse.ts` file of the npm package `@octokit/endpoint`. Version 10.1.3 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25285", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-18  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/endpoint.js/blob/main/src/parse.ts", "ref_desc": "endpoint.js/src/parse.ts at main \u00b7 octokit/endpoint.js \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/endpoint.js/security/advisories/GHSA-x4c5-c7rf-jjgv", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/endpoint.js/commit/6c9c5be033c450d436efb37de41b6470c22f7db8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
