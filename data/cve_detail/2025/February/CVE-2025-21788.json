{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21788", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases\n\nIf the XDP program doesn't result in XDP_PASS then we leak the\nmemory allocated by am65_cpsw_build_skb().\n\nIt is pointless to allocate SKB memory before running the XDP\nprogram as we would be wasting CPU cycles for cases other than XDP_PASS.\nMove the SKB allocation after evaluating the XDP program result.\n\nThis fixes the memleak. A performance boost is seen for XDP_DROP test.\n\nXDP_DROP test:\nBefore: 460256 rx/s                  0 err/s\nAfter:  784130 rx/s                  0 err/s", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21788", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.02%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1bba1d042107167164a0ae3a843fdf650ab005d7", "ref_desc": "net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5db843258de1e4e6b1ef1cbd1797923c9e3de548", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dc11f049612b9d926aca2e55f8dc9d82850d0da3", "ref_desc": "net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
