{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25182", "Description": "Stroom is a data processing, storage and analysis platform. A vulnerability exists starting in version 7.2-beta.53 and prior to versions 7.2.24, 7.3-beta.22, 7.4.4, and 7.5-beta.2 that allows authentication bypass to a Stroom system when configured with ALB and installed in a way that the application is accessible not through the ALB itself. This vulnerability may also allow for server-side request forgery which may lead to code execution or further privileges escalations when using the AWS metadata URL. This scenario assumes that Stroom must be configured to use ALB Authentication integration and the application is network accessible. The vulnerability has been fixed in versions 7.2.24, 7.3-beta.22, 7.4.4, and 7.5-beta.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25182", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.15%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/security/advisories/GHSA-x489-xx2m-vc43", "ref_desc": "Stroom Authentication/Authorization Bypass when using AWS ALB \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gchq/stroom \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gchq/stroom/pull/4320", "ref_desc": "Fix AWS signer validation by at055612 \u00b7 Pull Request #4320 \u00b7 gchq/stroom \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
