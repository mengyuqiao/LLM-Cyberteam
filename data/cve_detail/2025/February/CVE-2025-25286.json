{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25286", "Description": "Crayfish is a collection of Islandora 8 microservices, one of which, Homarus, provides FFmpeg as a microservice. Prior to Crayfish version 4.1.0, remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations. The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`. Some workarounds are available. The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus. Alternatively or additionally, configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25286", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.29%  +0.24 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-150 Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/150/Improper-Neutralization-of-Escape-Meta-or-Control-Sequence.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-157 Failure to Sanitize Paired Delimiters", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/157/Failure-to-Sanitize-Paired-Delimiters.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/commit/64cb4cec688928798cc40e6f0a0e863d7f69fd89", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 Islandora/Crayfish@64cb4ce \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-mm6v-68qp-f9fw", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via Homarus Authorization header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Islandora/Crayfish \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
