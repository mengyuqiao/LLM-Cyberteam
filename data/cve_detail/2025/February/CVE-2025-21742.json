{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21742", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusbnet: ipheth: use static NDP16 location in URB\n\nOriginal code allowed for the start of NDP16 to be anywhere within the\nURB based on the `wNdpIndex` value in NTH16. Only the start position of\nNDP16 was checked, so it was possible for even the fixed-length part\nof NDP16 to extend past the end of URB, leading to an out-of-bounds\nread.\n\nOn iOS devices, the NDP16 header always directly follows NTH16. Rely on\nand check for this specific format.\n\nThis, along with NCM-specific minimal URB length check that already\nexists, will ensure that the fixed-length part of NDP16 plus a set\namount of DPEs fit within the URB.\n\nNote that this commit alone does not fully address the OoB read.\nThe limit on the amount of DPEs needs to be enforced separately.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21742", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.7andbefore (<) 6.12.14cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.13andbefore (<) 6.13.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.5andbefore (<) 6.6.78cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.03 \n 2  2025-03-07  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2b619445dcb6dab97d8ed033fb57225aca1288c4", "ref_desc": "Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cf1ac7f7cf601ac31d1580559c002b5e37b733b7", "ref_desc": "Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86586dcb75cb8fd062a518aca8ee667938b91efb", "ref_desc": "Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8fb062178e1ce180e2cfdc9abc83a1b9fea381ca", "ref_desc": "Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
