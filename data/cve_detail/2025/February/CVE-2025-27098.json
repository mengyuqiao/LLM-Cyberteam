{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27098", "Description": "GraphQL Mesh is a GraphQL Federation framework and gateway for both GraphQL Federation and non-GraphQL Federation subgraphs, non-GraphQL services, such as REST and gRPC, and also databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Missing check vulnerability in the static file handler allows any client to access the files in the server's file system. When `staticFiles` is set in the `serve` settings in the configuration file, the following handler doesn't check if `absolutePath` is still under the directory provided as `staticFiles`. Users have two options to fix vulnerability; 1. Update `@graphql-mesh/cli` to a version higher than `0.82.21`, and if you use `@graphql-mesh/http`, update it to a version higher than `0.3.18` 2. Remove `staticFiles` option from the configuration, and use other solutions to serve static files.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27098", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nThe-guild\u00bbGraphql Mesh Cli\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 0.78.0andbefore (<) 0.82.22cpe:2.3:a:the-guild:graphql_mesh_cli:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nThe-guild\u00bbGraphql Mesh Http\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.3.19cpe:2.3:a:the-guild:graphql_mesh_http:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-24  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.04%  -0.05 \n 3  2025-02-28  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-mesh/security/advisories/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
