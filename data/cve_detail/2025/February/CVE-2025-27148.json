{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27148", "Description": "Gradle is a build automation tool, and its native-platform tool provides Java bindings for native APIs. On Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. This library initialization could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. Gradle builds that rely on versions of net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to 0.22-milestone-28 could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory.\n\nIn net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to version 0.22-milestone-28, if the `Native.get(Class<>)` method was called, without calling `Native.init(File)` first, with a non-`null` argument used as working file path, then the library would initialize itself using the system temporary directory and NativeLibraryLocator.java lines 68 through 78. Version 0.22-milestone-28 has been released with changes that fix the problem. Initialization is now mandatory and no longer uses the system temporary directory, unless such a path is passed for initialization. The only workaround for affected versions is to make sure to do a proper initialization, using a location that is safe.\n\nGradle 8.12, only that exact version, had codepaths where the initialization of the underlying native integration library took a default path, relying on copying the binaries to the system temporary directory. Any execution of Gradle exposed this exploit. Users of Windows or modern versions of macOS are not vulnerable, nor are users of a Unix-like operating system with the \"sticky\" bit set or `noexec` on their system temporary directory vulnerable. This problem was fixed in Gradle 8.12.1. Gradle 8.13 release also upgrades to a version of the native library that no longer has that bug. Some workarounds are available. On Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the \"sticky\" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. Mounting `/tmp` as `noexec` will prevent Gradle 8.12 from starting. Those who are are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property java.io.tmpdir. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27148", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-378 Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/378/Creation-of-Temporary-File-With-Insecure-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-379 Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/379/Creation-of-Temporary-File-in-Directory-with-Insecure-Permis.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/native-platform/pull/353", "ref_desc": "Require explicit initialization of native integration by lptr \u00b7 Pull Request #353 \u00b7 gradle/native-platform \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit", "ref_desc": "Sticky bit - Wikipedia", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/native-platform/blob/574dfe8d9fb546c990436468d617ab81c140871d/native-platform/src/main/java/net/rubygrapefruit/platform/internal/NativeLibraryLocator.java#L68-L78", "ref_desc": "native-platform/native-platform/src/main/java/net/rubygrapefruit/platform/internal/NativeLibraryLocator.java at 574dfe8d9fb546c990436468d617ab81c140871d \u00b7 gradle/native-platform \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-89qm-pxvm-p336", "ref_desc": "Local privilege escalation through system temporary directory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FTl-7uvwiXmbg1kuKprgxgrEQeg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-465q-w4mf-4f4r", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/native-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-2xxp-vw2f-p3x8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/32025", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab#Options_common_to_all_filesystems", "ref_desc": "fstab - Wikipedia", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
