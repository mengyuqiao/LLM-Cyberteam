{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21771", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched_ext: Fix incorrect autogroup migration detection\n\nscx_move_task() is called from sched_move_task() and tells the BPF scheduler\nthat cgroup migration is being committed. sched_move_task() is used by both\ncgroup and autogroup migrations and scx_move_task() tried to filter out\nautogroup migrations by testing the destination cgroup and PF_EXITING but\nthis is not enough. In fact, without explicitly tagging the thread which is\ndoing the cgroup migration, there is no good way to tell apart\nscx_move_task() invocations for racing migration to the root cgroup and an\nautogroup migration.\n\nThis led to scx_move_task() incorrectly ignoring a migration from non-root\ncgroup to an autogroup of the root cgroup triggering the following warning:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 1 at kernel/sched/ext.c:3725 scx_cgroup_can_attach+0x196/0x340\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n    cgroup_migrate_execute+0x5b1/0x700\n    cgroup_attach_task+0x296/0x400\n    __cgroup_procs_write+0x128/0x140\n    cgroup_procs_write+0x17/0x30\n    kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x141/0x1f0\n    vfs_write+0x31d/0x4a0\n    __x64_sys_write+0x72/0xf0\n    do_syscall_64+0x82/0x160\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nFix it by adding an argument to sched_move_task() that indicates whether the\nmoving is for a cgroup or autogroup migration. After the change,\nscx_move_task() is called only for cgroup migrations and renamed to\nscx_cgroup_move_task().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21771", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8b510d0ddc65d8a71e0f9a3acc9ed5f010fc514", "ref_desc": "sched_ext: Fix incorrect autogroup migration detection - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6f3e7d564b2309e1f17e709a70eca78d7ca2bb8", "ref_desc": "sched_ext: Fix incorrect autogroup migration detection - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75bf2f80c046d2ec5a07455891ea0a9fb6d8b5f6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
