{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21768", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ipv6: fix dst ref loops in rpl, seg6 and ioam6 lwtunnels\n\nSome lwtunnels have a dst cache for post-transformation dst.\nIf the packet destination did not change we may end up recording\na reference to the lwtunnel in its own cache, and the lwtunnel\nstate will never be freed.\n\nDiscovered by the ioam6.sh test, kmemleak was recently fixed\nto catch per-cpu memory leaks. I'm not sure if rpl and seg6\ncan actually hit this, but in principle I don't see why not.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21768", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4c0f200c7d06fedddde82209c099014d63f4a6c0", "ref_desc": "net: ipv6: fix dst ref loops in rpl, seg6 and ioam6 lwtunnels - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/92191dd1073088753821b862b791dcc83e558e07", "ref_desc": "net: ipv6: fix dst ref loops in rpl, seg6 and ioam6 lwtunnels - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5ab11a4e219e93b8b31a27f8ec98d42afadd8b7a", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
