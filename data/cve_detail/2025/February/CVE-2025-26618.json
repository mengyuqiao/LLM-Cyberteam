{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-26618", "Description": "Erlang is a programming language and runtime system for building massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. OTP is a set of Erlang libraries, which consists of the Erlang runtime system, a number of ready-to-use components mainly written in Erlang. Packet size is not verified properly for SFTP packets. As a result when multiple SSH packets (conforming to max SSH packet size) are received by ssh, they might be combined into an SFTP packet which will exceed the max allowed packet size and potentially cause large amount of memory to be allocated. Note that situation described above can only happen for successfully authenticated users after completing the SSH handshake. This issue has been patched in OTP versions 27.2.4, 26.2.5.9, and 25.3.2.18. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26618", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/789/Memory-Allocation-with-Excessive-Size-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/0ed2573cbd55c92e9125c9dc70fa1ca7fed82872", "ref_desc": "ssh: sftp reject packets exceeding limit \u00b7 erlang/otp@0ed2573 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/erlang/otp/security/advisories/GHSA-78cv-45vx-q6fr", "ref_desc": "SSH SFTP packet size not verified properly \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 erlang/otp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://erlang.org/download/OTP-27.2.4.README.md", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
