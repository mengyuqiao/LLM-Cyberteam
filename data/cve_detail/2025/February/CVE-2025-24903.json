{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24903", "Description": "libsignal-service-rs is a Rust version of the libsignal-service-java library which implements the core functionality to communicate with Signal servers. Prior to commit 82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8, any contact may forge a sync message, impersonating another device of the local user. The origin of sync messages is not checked. Patched libsignal-service can be found after commit 82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8. The `Metadata` struct contains an additional `was_encrypted` field, which breaks the API, but should be easily resolvable. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24903", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 1 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.02%  0.01%  0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-r58q-66g9-h6g8", "ref_desc": "Origin of Sync Messages is unchecked \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/commit/82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'advisory-fix-2' \u00b7 whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs@82d70f6 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NS2rAFU8gFNU0N7sUqFotoN4rq0.html"}]}
