{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27137", "Description": "Dependency-Track is a component analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag, which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6, users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka \"Alert\"), and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor, sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions, the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround, avoid assigning the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team. Assigning this permission to non-administrative users or teams is a security risk in itself, and highly discouraged.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27137", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/73/External-Control-of-File-Name-or-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/680", "ref_desc": "Report a Security Vulnerability \u00b7 Issue #680 \u00b7 PebbleTemplates/pebbleCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3XSqT84K_eLYlkGLppq1VAkPx1s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4685", "ref_desc": "Backport: Disable `include` tag for Pebble templates by nscuro \u00b7 Pull Request #4685 \u00b7 DependencyTrack/dependency-track \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4684", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-p75g-cxfj-7wrx", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/tag/include", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RnM86Gc9ZVJi15LM7g7bCDNhmEg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-9582-88hr-54w3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
