{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25201", "Description": "Nitrokey 3 Firmware is the the firmware of Nitrokey 3 USB keys. For release 1.8.0, and test releases with PIV enabled prior to 1.8.0, the PIV application could accept invalid keys for authentication of the admin key. This could lead to compromise of the integrity of the data stored in the application. An attacker without access to the proper administration key would be able to generate new keys and overwrite certificates. Such an attacker would not be able to read-out or extract existing private data, nor would they be able to gain access to cryptographic operations that would normally require PIN-based authentication. The issue is fixed in piv-authenticator 0.3.9, and in Nitrokey's firmware 1.8.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25201", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 1 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.01%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.nitrokey.com/blog/2025/nitrokey-3-firmware-v181-security-update", "ref_desc": "Nitrokey 3 Firmware v1.8.1 Security Update | Nitrokey", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-3-firmware/releases/tag/v1.8.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.8.1 \u00b7 Nitrokey/nitrokey-3-firmware \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-3-firmware/security/advisories/GHSA-jfhm-ppq8-7hgx", "ref_desc": "Improper Validation of Admin Key in PIV Smartcard \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Nitrokey/nitrokey-3-firmware \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
