{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25186", "Description": "Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client functionality in Ruby. Starting in version 0.3.2 and prior to versions 0.3.8, 0.4.19, and 0.5.6, there is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion in `net-imap`'s response parser.  At any time while the client is connected, a malicious server can send  can send highly compressed `uid-set` data which is automatically read by the client's receiver thread. The response parser uses `Range#to_a` to convert the `uid-set` data into arrays of integers, with no limitation on the expanded size of the ranges. Versions 0.3.8, 0.4.19, 0.5.6, and higher fix this issue. Additional details for proper configuration of fixed versions and backward compatibility are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25186", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-405 Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/405/Asymmetric-Resource-Consumption-Amplification-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-409 Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/409/Improper-Handling-of-Highly-Compressed-Data-Data-Amplificat.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/789/Memory-Allocation-with-Excessive-Size-Value.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1287 Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1287/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Type-of-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/commit/70e3ddd071a94e450b3238570af482c296380b35", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/commit/c8c5a643739d2669f0c9a6bb9770d0c045fd74a3", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 ruby/net-imap@c8c5a64 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/commit/cb92191b1ddce2d978d01b56a0883b6ecf0b1022", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/security/advisories/GHSA-7fc5-f82f-cx69", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
