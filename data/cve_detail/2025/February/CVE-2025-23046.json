{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23046", "Description": "GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 9.5.0 and prior to version 10.0.18, if a \"Mail servers\" authentication provider is configured to use an Oauth connection provided by the OauthIMAP plugin, anyone can connect to GLPI using a user name on which an Oauth authorization has already been established. Version 10.0.18 contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disable any \"Mail servers\" authentication provider configured to use an Oauth connection provided by the OauthIMAP plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23046", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 4  2025-03-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-303 Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/303/Incorrect-Implementation-of-Authentication-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/tag/10.0.18", "ref_desc": "Release 10.0.18 \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gUdwbwuRMEW_ANo5VA8LFL5uD1Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-vfxc-qg3v-j2r5", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
