{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24959", "Description": "zx is a tool for writing better scripts. An attacker with control over environment variable values can inject unintended environment variables into `process.env`. This can lead to arbitrary command execution or unexpected behavior in applications that rely on environment variables for security-sensitive operations. Applications that process untrusted input and pass it through `dotenv.stringify` are particularly vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 8.3.2. Users should immediately upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. If upgrading is not feasible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by sanitizing user-controlled environment variable values before passing them to `dotenv.stringify`. Specifically, avoid using `\"`, `'`, and backticks in values, or enforce strict validation of environment variables before usage.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24959", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/zx/pull/1094", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/zx/security/advisories/GHSA-qwp8-x4ff-5h87", "ref_desc": "Environment Variable Injection for dotenv API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 google/zx \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
