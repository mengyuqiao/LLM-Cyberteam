{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-26793", "Description": "The Web GUI configuration panel of Hirsch (formerly Identiv and Viscount) Enterphone MESH through 2024 ships with default credentials (username freedom, password viscount). The administrator is not prompted to change these credentials on initial configuration, and changing the credentials requires many steps. Attackers can use the credentials over the Internet via mesh.webadmin.MESHAdminServlet to gain access to dozens of Canadian and U.S. apartment buildings and obtain building residents' PII. NOTE: the Supplier's perspective is that the \"vulnerable systems are not following manufacturers' recommendations to change the default password.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26793", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "5.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-28  0.70%  5.07%  +4.38 \n 2  2025-03-27  5.07%  0.70%  -4.38 \n 3  2025-03-24  0.70%  5.07%  +4.38 \n 4  2025-03-23  5.07%  0.70%  -4.38 \n 5  2025-03-20  8.66%  5.07%  -3.58 \n 6  2025-03-17  0.07%  8.66%  +8.59 \n 7  2025-03-10  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 8  2025-02-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1393 Use of Default Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1393/Use-of-Default-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.identiv.com/products/physical-access/hirsch/", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43160884", "ref_desc": "Breaking into apartment buildings in five minutes on my phone | Hacker News", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ericdaigle.ca/posts/breaking-into-dozens-of-apartments-in-five-minutes/", "ref_desc": "Breaking into dozens of apartment buildings in five minutes on my phone \u2013 Eric Daigle", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
