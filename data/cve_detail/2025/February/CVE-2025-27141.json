{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27141", "Description": "Metabase Enterprise Edition is the enterprise version of Metabase business intelligence and data analytics software. Starting in version 1.47.0 and prior to versions 1.50.36, 1.51.14, 1.52.11, and 1.53.2 of Metabase Enterprise Edition, users with impersonation permissions may be able to see results of cached questions, even if their permissions don\u2019t allow them to see the data. If some user runs a question which gets cached, and then an impersonated user runs that question, then the impersonated user sees the same results as the previous user. These cached results may include data the impersonated user should not have access to. This vulnerability only impacts the Enterprise Edition of Metabase and not the Open Source Edition. Versions 1.53.2, 1.52.11, 1.51.14, and 1.50.36 contains a patch. Versions on the 1.49.X, 1.48.X, and 1.47.X branches are vulnerable but do not have a patch available, so users should upgrade to a major version with an available fix. Disabling question caching is a workaround for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27141", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMetabase\u00bbMetabase\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 1.51.0andbefore (<) 1.51.14cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabase\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 1.47.0andbefore (<) 1.50.36cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabase\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 1.52.0andbefore (<) 1.52.11cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabase\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 1.53.0andbefore (<) 1.53.2cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-28  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.03%  -0.04 \n 3  2025-03-01  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/configuring-metabase/caching", "ref_desc": "Caching query results | Metabase DocumentationTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-6cc4-h534-xh5p", "ref_desc": "Cached questions leak data to impersonated users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/permissions/impersonation", "ref_desc": "Impersonation access | Metabase DocumentationTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
