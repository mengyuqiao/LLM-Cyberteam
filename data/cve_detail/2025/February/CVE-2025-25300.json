{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25300", "Description": "smartbanner.js is a customizable smart app banner for iOS and Android. Prior to version 1.14.1, clicking on smartbanner `View` link and navigating to 3rd party page leaves `window.opener` exposed. It may allow hostile third parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection on the original page with smartbanner. `rel=\"noopener\"` is automatically populated to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the vulnerability. Some workarounds are available for those who cannot upgrade. Ensure `View` link is only taking users to App Store or Google Play Store where security is guarded by respective app store security teams. If `View` link is going to a third party page, limit smartbanner.js to be used on iOS that decreases the scope of the vulnerability since as of Safari 12.1,  `rel=\"noopener\"` is imposed on all `target=\"_blank\"` links. Version 1.14.1 of smartbanner.js contains a fix for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25300", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-22  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2", "ref_desc": "rel noopener vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ain/smartbanner.js \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/commit/fce8c31dfe04033d9d005a89694d3e7a60784f89", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
