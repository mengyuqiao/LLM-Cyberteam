{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25187", "Description": "Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by adding note titles to the document using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, without first escaping HTML entities. Joplin lacks a Content-Security-Policy with a restrictive `script-src`. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution via inline `onclick`/`onload` event handlers in unsanitized HTML. Additionally, Joplin's main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution. Anyone who 1) receives notes from unknown sources and 2) uses <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> to search is impacted. This issue has been addressed in version 3.1.24 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25187", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/360ece6f8873ef81afbfb98b25faad696ffccdb6", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-9gfv-q6wj-fr3c", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/2fc9bd476b0d9abcddb0a46f615a48333779d225/packages/app-desktop/plugins/GotoAnything.tsx#L558", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
