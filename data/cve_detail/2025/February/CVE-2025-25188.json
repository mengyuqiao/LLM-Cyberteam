{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25188", "Description": "Hickory DNS is a Rust based DNS client, server, and resolver. A vulnerability present starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 impacts Hickory DNS users relying on DNSSEC verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive resolver. The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone. Versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 fix the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25188", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4", "ref_desc": "DNSSEC validation may accept broken authentication chains \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hickory-dns/hickory-dns \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/commit/e118c6eec569f4340421f86ee0686714010c63e9", "ref_desc": "Check RRSIG over DNSKEY RRset w/ authenticated key \u00b7 hickory-dns/hickory-dns@e118c6e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
