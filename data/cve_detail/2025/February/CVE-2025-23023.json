{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-23023", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions an attacker can carefully craft a request with the right request headers to poison the anonymous cache (for example, the cache may have a response with missing  preloaded data). This issue only affects anonymous visitors of the site. This problem has been patched in the latest version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable anonymous cache by setting the `DISCOURSE_DISABLE_ANON_CACHE` environment variable to a non-empty value.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23023", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.02%  0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.03%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-5h4h-2f46-r3c7", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
