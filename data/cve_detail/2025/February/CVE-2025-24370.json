{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24370", "Description": "Django-Unicorn adds modern reactive component functionality to Django templates. Affected versions of Django-Unicorn are vulnerable to python class pollution vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the core functionality `set_property_value`, which can be remotely triggered by users by crafting appropriate component requests and feeding in values of second and third parameter to the vulnerable function, leading to arbitrary changes to the python runtime status. With this finding at least five ways of vulnerability exploitation have been observed, stably resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and Authentication Bypass attacks in almost every Django-Unicorn-based application. This issue has been addressed in version 0.62.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24370", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.16%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.16%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-915 Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/915/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Dynamically-Determined.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/security/advisories/GHSA-g9wf-5777-gq43", "ref_desc": "Django-Unicorn Class Pollution Vulnerability, Leading to XSS, DoS and Authentication Bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 adamghill/django-unicorn \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/commit/17614200f27174f789d4af54cc3a1f2b0df7870c", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 adamghill/django-unicorn@1761420 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
