{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25305", "Description": "Home Assistant Core is an open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Affected versions are subject to a potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries. In the past, `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0, this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen. When migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant, in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True`, which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.1.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25305", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-22  0.03%  0.03%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-940 Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/940/Improper-Verification-of-Source-of-a-Communication-Channel.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-m3pm-rpgg-5wj6", "ref_desc": "SSL validation for outgoing requests in core and used libs not correct \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 home-assistant/core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
