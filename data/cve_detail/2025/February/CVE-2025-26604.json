{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-26604", "Description": "Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel is a Discord bot framework built with interactions.py, featuring modular extension management and secure execution. Because of the nature of arbitrary user-submited code execution, this allows user to execute potentially malicious code to perform damage or extract sensitive information. By loading the module containing the following code and run the command, the bot token can be extracted. Then the attacker can load a blocking module to sabotage the bot (DDoS attack) and the token can be used to make the fake bot act as the real one. If the bot has very high privilege, the attacker basically has full control before the user kicks the bot. Any Discord user that hosts Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel before commit f0d9e70841a0e3170b88c4f8d562018ccd8e8b14 is affected. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attempt to limit their discord bot's access via configuration options.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26604", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-22  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Discord-Agora/Kernel/commit/f0d9e70841a0e3170b88c4f8d562018ccd8e8b14", "ref_desc": "Change the Token load process and remove unnecessary firejail file pe\u2026 \u00b7 Discord-Agora/Kernel@f0d9e70 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Discord-Agora/Kernel/security/advisories/GHSA-87jf-gf75-wwfm", "ref_desc": "Possibility to retrieve bot token by malicious module developers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Discord-Agora/Kernel \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
