{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25205", "Description": "Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25205", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.16%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-202 Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/202/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-Through-Data-Queries.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/1a3d70d04100924d41391acb55bd8ddca486a4fa/server/Auth.js#L17-L41", "ref_desc": "audiobookshelf/server/Auth.js at 1a3d70d04100924d41391acb55bd8ddca486a4fa \u00b7 advplyr/audiobookshelf \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-pg8v-5jcv-wrvw", "ref_desc": "Remote Authentication-Bypass can lead to server crash or limited information disclosure due to faulty pattern matching \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 advplyr/audiobookshelf \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/bf8407274e3ee300af1927ee660d078a7a801e1c", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/ec6537656925a43871b07cfee12c9f383844d224", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/pull/3584", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
