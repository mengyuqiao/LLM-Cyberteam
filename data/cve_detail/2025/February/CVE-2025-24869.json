{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24869", "Description": "SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java allows an attacker to access an endpoint that can disclose information about deployed server components, including their XML definitions. This information should ideally be restricted to customer administrators, even though they may not need it. These XML files are not entirely SAP-internal as they are deployed with the server. In such a scenario, sensitive information could be exposed without compromising its integrity or availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24869", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.03%  0.03%  0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://me.sap.com/notes/3550027", "ref_desc": "SAP for Me: Sign In", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://url.sap/sapsecuritypatchday", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Notes & NewsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rLkoWfUarlCkanLwjmA-fd6W-20.html"}]}
