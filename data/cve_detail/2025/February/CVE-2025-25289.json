{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25289", "Description": "@octokit/request-error is an error class for Octokit request errors. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 6.1.7, a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the processing of HTTP request headers. By sending an authorization header containing an excessively long sequence of spaces followed by a newline and \"@\", an attacker can exploit inefficient regular expression processing, leading to excessive resource consumption. This can significantly degrade server performance or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, impacting availability. Version 6.1.7 contains a fix for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25289", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-18  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/request-error.js/blob/main/src/index.ts", "ref_desc": "request-error.js/src/index.ts at main \u00b7 octokit/request-error.js \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/request-error.js/commit/d558320874a4bc8d356babf1079e6f0056a59b9e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/request-error.js/security/advisories/GHSA-xx4v-prfh-6cgc", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
