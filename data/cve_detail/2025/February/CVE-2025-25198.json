{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25198", "Description": "mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. Prior to version 2025-01a, a vulnerability in mailcow's password reset functionality allows an attacker to manipulate the `Host HTTP` header to generate a password reset link pointing to an attacker-controlled domain. This can lead to account takeover if a user clicks the poisoned link. Version 2025-01a contains a patch. As a workaround, deactivate the password reset functionality by clearing `Notification email sender` and `Notification email subject` under System -> Configuration -> Options -> Password Settings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25198", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.03%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-3mvx-qw4r-fcqf", "ref_desc": "Password reset poisoning \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
