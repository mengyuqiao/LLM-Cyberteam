{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24031", "Description": "PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate based user login. In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN. When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch for the issue is unavailable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24031", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.01%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.01%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/blob/bb2e3f3a95e44fdf44b0d5a4b377db3179021380/src/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.c#L797", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/security/advisories/GHSA-wvr3-c9x3-9mff", "ref_desc": "Segmentation fault on ctrl-c/ctrl-d when asked for PIN \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenSC/pam_pkcs11 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/blob/bb2e3f3a95e44fdf44b0d5a4b377db3179021380/src/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.c#L211", "ref_desc": "pam_pkcs11/src/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.c at bb2e3f3a95e44fdf44b0d5a4b377db3179021380 \u00b7 OpenSC/pam_pkcs11 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
