{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24028", "Description": "Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by differences between how Joplin's HTML sanitizer handles comments and how the browser handles comments. This affects both the Rich Text Editor and the Markdown viewer. However, unlike the Rich Text Editor, the Markdown viewer is `cross-origin isolated`, which prevents JavaScript from directly accessing functions/variables in the toplevel Joplin `window`. This issue is not present in Joplin 3.1.24 and may have been introduced in `9b50539`. This is an XSS vulnerability that impacts users that open untrusted notes in the Rich Text Editor. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.2.12 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24028", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-5w3c-wph9-hq92", "ref_desc": "XSS in Rich Text Editor allows arbitrary code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 laurent22/joplin \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/9b505395918bc923f34fe6f3b960bb10e8cf234e", "ref_desc": "Desktop: Keep comments when rendering Markdown to allow rendered note\u2026 \u00b7 laurent22/joplin@9b50539 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/2a058ed8097c2502e152b26394dc1917897f5817", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://joplinapp.org/help/dev/spec/note_viewer_isolation", "ref_desc": "Note viewer isolation | Joplin", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
