{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27143", "Description": "Better Auth is an authentication and authorization library for TypeScript. Prior to version 1.1.21, the application is vulnerable to an open redirect due to improper validation of the callbackURL parameter in the email verification endpoint and any other endpoint that accepts callback url. While the server blocks fully qualified URLs, it incorrectly allows scheme-less URLs. This results in the browser interpreting the URL as a fully qualified URL, leading to unintended redirection. An attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a malicious verification link and tricking users into clicking it. Upon successful email verification, the user will be automatically redirected to the attacker's website, which can be used for phishing, malware distribution, or stealing sensitive authentication tokens. This CVE is a bypass of the fix for GHSA-8jhw-6pjj-8723/CVE-2024-56734. Version 1.1.21 contains an updated patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27143", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nBetter-auth\u00bbBetter Auth\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.1.21cpe:2.3:a:better-auth:better_auth:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-8jhw-6pjj-8723", "ref_desc": "Not ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0ppb0DtrYa--Sr2W2lwMz-rb6j0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-hjpm-7mrm-26w8", "ref_desc": "Open Redirect via Scheme-Less Callback Parameter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 better-auth/better-auth \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/releases/tag/v1.1.21", "ref_desc": "Release v1.1.21 \u00b7 better-auth/better-auth \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/24659aefc35a536b95ea4e5347e52c8803910153", "ref_desc": "Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/commit/b381cac7aafd6aa53ef78b6ab771ebfa24643c80", "ref_desc": "fix(origin-check): add tests for callback URLs with malicious patterns \u00b7 better-auth/better-auth@b381cac \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
