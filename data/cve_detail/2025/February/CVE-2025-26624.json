{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-26624", "Description": "Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives. A DLL hijacking vulnerability in Rufus 4.6.2208 and earlier versions allows an attacker loading and executing a malicious DLL with escalated privileges (since the executable has been granted higher privileges during the time of launch) due to the ability to inject a malicious `cfgmgr32.dll` in the same directory as the executable and have it side load automatically. This is fixed in commit `74dfa49`, which will be part of version 4.7. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as version 4.7 becomes available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26624", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-22  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/commit/74dfa49707fd626b58d776d3400295740a29e23e", "ref_desc": "[dev] fix a side-loading vulnerability with cfgmgr32.dll \u00b7 pbatard/rufus@74dfa49 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/security/advisories/GHSA-p8p5-r296-g2jv", "ref_desc": "Local Privilege Escalation in Rufus 4.6 and previous versions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pbatard/rufus \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
