{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27408", "Description": "Manifest offers users a one-file micro back end. Prior to version 4.9.2, Manifest employs a weak password hashing implementation that uses SHA3 without a salt. This exposes user passwords to a higher risk of being cracked if an attacker gains access to the database. Without the use of a salt, identical passwords across multiple users will result in the same hash, making it easier for attackers to identify and exploit patterns, thereby accelerating the cracking process. Version 4.9.2 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27408", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-759 Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/759/Use-of-a-One-Way-Hash-without-a-Salt.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mnfst/manifest/security/advisories/GHSA-h8h6-7752-g28c", "ref_desc": "Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt in manifest \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mnfst/manifest \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mnfst/manifest/commit/3ed6f1324e96ad469ad929d470dcd0cc386c6c69", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 mnfst/manifest@3ed6f13 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
