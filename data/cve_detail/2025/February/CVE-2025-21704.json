{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21704", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: cdc-acm: Check control transfer buffer size before access\n\nIf the first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification, we can't\ncalculate an expected_size. Log an error and discard the notification\ninstead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which can\nlead to memory corruption when the expected_size decreases between\nfragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap.\n\nThis issue has been present since the beginning of git history; however,\nit only leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1\n(\"cdc-acm: reassemble fragmented notifications\").\n\nA mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace\nhas opened /dev/ttyACM*; but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager will\ndo that automatically depending on the USB device's vendor/product IDs and\nits other interfaces.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21704", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-03-26  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues/395107243", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a4e1ae5c0533964170197e4fb4f33bc8c1db5cd2", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7828e9363ac4d23b02419bf2a45b9f1d9fb35646", "ref_desc": "usb: cdc-acm: Check control transfer buffer size before access - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/871619c2b78fdfe05afb4e8ba548678687beb812", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/90dd2f1b7342b9a671a5ea4160f408037b92b118", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f64079bef6a8a7823358c3f352ea29a617844636", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/383d516a0ebc8641372b521c8cb717f0f1834831", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e563b01208f4d1f609bcab13333b6c0e24ce6a01", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6abb510251e75f875797d8983a830e6731fa281c", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
