{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25304", "Description": "Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Prior to version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections, the `vlSelectionTuples` function can be used to call JavaScript functions, leading to cross-site scripting.`vlSelectionTuples` calls multiple functions that can be controlled by an attacker, including one call with an attacker-controlled argument. This can be used to call `Function()` with arbitrary JavaScript and the resulting function can be called with `vlSelectionTuples` or using a type coercion to call `toString` or `valueOf`. Version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections fix this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25304", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-18  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega/blob/b45cf431cd6c0d0c0e1567f087f9b3b55bc236fa/packages/vega-selections/src/selectionTuples.js#L14", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-mp7w-mhcv-673j", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vega/vega/commit/9fb9ea07e27984394e463d286eb73944fa61411e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
