{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-26326", "Description": "A vulnerability was identified in the NVDA Remote (version 2.6.4) and Tele NVDA Remote (version 2025.3.3) remote connection add-ons, which allows an attacker to obtain total control of the remote system by guessing a weak password. The problem occurs because these add-ons accept any password entered by the user and do not have an additional authentication or computer verification mechanism. Tests indicate that more than 1,000 systems use easy-to-guess passwords, many with less than 4 to 6 characters, including common sequences. This allows brute force attacks or trial-and-error attempts by malicious invaders. The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker who knows or can guess the password used in the connection. As a result, the attacker gains complete access to the affected system and can execute commands, modify files, and compromise user security.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26326", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-28  6.49%  0.39%  -6.11 \n 2  2025-03-27  1.62%  6.49%  +4.88 \n 3  2025-03-25  1.26%  1.62%  +0.36 \n 4  2025-03-23  0.29%  1.26%  +0.96 \n 5  2025-03-20  1.45%  0.29%  -1.16 \n 6  2025-03-18  1.11%  1.45%  +0.35 \n 7  2025-03-17  0.04%  1.11%  +1.06 \n 8  2025-03-14  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/azurejoga/CVE-2025-26326", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nvdaremote.com/", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.nvaccess.org", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nvda-es/TeleNVDA", "ref_desc": "GitHub - nvda-es/TeleNVDA: A forked version of the NVDA Remote add-on", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NVDARemote/NVDARemote", "ref_desc": "GitHub - NVDARemote/NVDARemote: The NVDA Remote Access add-on", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nvda-addons.org/addon.php?id=270", "ref_desc": "TeleNVDA | NVDA Add-ons Directory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
