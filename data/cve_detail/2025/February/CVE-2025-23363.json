The SSO login service of affected applications accepts user-controlled input that could specify a link to an external site. This could allow an attacker to redirect the legitimate user to an attacker-chosen URL to steal valid session data. For a successful exploit, the legitimate user must actively click on an attacker-crafted link.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23363", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-28  0.03%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-27  0.04%  0.03%  -0.01 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.04%  -0.02 \n 5  2025-02-26  0.09%  0.06%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-656895.html", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
