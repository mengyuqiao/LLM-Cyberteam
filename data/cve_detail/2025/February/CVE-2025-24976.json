{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24976", "Description": "Distribution is a toolkit to pack, ship, store, and deliver container content. Systems running registry versions 3.0.0-beta.1 through 3.0.0-rc.2 with token authentication enabled may be vulnerable to an issue in which token authentication allows an attacker to inject an untrusted signing key in a JSON web token (JWT). The issue lies in how the JSON web key (JWK) verification is performed. When a JWT contains a JWK header without a certificate chain, the code only checks if the KeyID (`kid`) matches one of the trusted keys, but doesn't verify that the actual key material matches. A fix for the issue is available at commit 5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd and expected to be a part of version 3.0.0-rc.3. There is no way to work around this issue without patching if the system requires token authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24976", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/distribution/distribution/commit/5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/distribution/distribution/security/advisories/GHSA-phw4-mc57-4hwc", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
