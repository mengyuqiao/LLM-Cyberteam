{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27090", "Description": "Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. The reverse port forwarding in sliver teamserver allows the implant to open a reverse tunnel on the sliver teamserver without verifying if the operator instructed the implant to do so. The only impact that has been shown is the exposure of the server's IP address to a third party. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27090", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBishopfox\u00bbSliverVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.26andbefore (<) 1.5.43cpe:2.3:a:bishopfox:sliver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-28  0.73%  0.06%  -0.67 \n 2  2025-03-27  0.06%  0.73%  +0.67 \n 3  2025-03-23  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-02-28  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/commit/10e245326070c6a5884a02e0790bb7e2baefb3a1", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #1890 from BishopFox/fix/v1.5.x/GHSA-fh4v-v779-4g2w \u00b7 BishopFox/sliver@10e2453 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/security/advisories/GHSA-fh4v-v779-4g2w", "ref_desc": "SSRF in sliver teamserver v1.5.42/85b0e870d05ec47184958dbcb871ddee2eb9e3df \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 BishopFox/sliver \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/commit/0f340a25cf3d496ed870dae7da39eab4427bc16f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #1889 from BishopFox/fix/GHSA-fh4v-v779-4g2w \u00b7 BishopFox/sliver@0f340a2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
