{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-27400", "Description": "Magento Long Term Support (LTS) is an unofficial, community-driven project provides an alternative to the Magento Community Edition e-commerce platform with a high level of backward compatibility. Versions prior to 20.12.3 and 20.13.1 contain a vulnerability that allows script execution in the admin panel which could lead to cross-site scripting against authenticated admin users. The attack requires an admin user with configuration access, so in practicality it is not very likely to be useful given that a user with this level of access is probably already a full admin. Versions 20.12.3 and 20.13.1 contain a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27400", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.12%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/commit/d307e5bf75729a2347dde0952fe9fd9fcd9c6aea", "ref_desc": "Sanitize skin urls that could be used for XSS (#4654) \u00b7 OpenMage/magento-lts@d307e5b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/releases/tag/v20.13.0", "ref_desc": "Release v20.13.0 \ud83c\udf08 \u00b7 OpenMage/magento-lts \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/security/advisories/GHSA-5pxh-89cx-4668", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in theme config fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenMage/magento-lts \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/releases/tag/v20.12.3", "ref_desc": "Release v20.12.3 \u00b7 OpenMage/magento-lts \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
