There is a problem with current\nimplementation of page size calculation which is not considering\nthe offset in the calculation. This might lead to passing of\nimproper and out-of-bounds page size which could result in\nmemory issue. Calculate page start and page end using the offset\nadjusted address instead of absolute address.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21734", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c3f7161123fcbdc64e90119ccce292d8b66281c4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c0464bad0e85fcd5d47e4297d1e410097c979e55", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/24a79c6bc8de763f7c50f4f84f8b0c183bc25a51", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c56ba3ea8e3c9a69a992aad18f7a65e43e51d623", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e966eae72762ecfdbdb82627e2cda48845b9dd66", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
