{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-26603", "Description": "Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Vim allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26603", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-22  0.02%  0.02%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-63p5-mwg2-787v", "ref_desc": "heap use-after-free in str_to_reg() in Vim < 9.1.1115 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vim/vim \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/c0f0e2380e5954f4a52a131bf6b8", "ref_desc": "patch 9.1.1115: [security]: use-after-free in str_to_reg() \u00b7 vim/vim@c0f0e23 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250306-0003/", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
