{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21786", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nworkqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool\n\nThe commit 68f83057b913(\"workqueue: Reap workers via kthread_stop() and\nremove detach_completion\") adds code to reap the normal workers but\nmistakenly does not handle the rescuer and also removes the code waiting\nfor the rescuer in put_unbound_pool(), which caused a use-after-free bug\nreported by Cheung Wall.\n\nTo avoid the use-after-free bug, the pool\u2019s reference must be held until\nthe detachment is complete. Therefore, move the code that puts the pwq\nafter detaching the rescuer from the pool.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21786", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.13andbefore (<) 6.13.4cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.12.16cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 2 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.02%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e7c16028a424dd35be1064a68fa318be4359310f", "ref_desc": "workqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/835b69c868f53f959d4986bbecd561ba6f38e492", "ref_desc": "workqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e76946110137703c16423baf6ee177b751a34b7e", "ref_desc": "workqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
