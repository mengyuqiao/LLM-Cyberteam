When a special crafted packet is received via SslHandler it doesn't correctly handle validation of such a packet in all cases which can lead to a native crash. Version 4.1.118.Final contains a patch. As workaround its possible to either disable the usage of the native SSLEngine or change the code manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24970", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.17%  +0.10 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0005/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2025-24970 Apache Netty Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/87f40725155b2f89adfde68c7732f97c153676c4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
