{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-24898", "Description": "rust-openssl is a set of OpenSSL bindings for the Rust programming language. In affected versions `ssl::select_next_proto` can return a slice pointing into the `server` argument's buffer but with a lifetime bound to the `client` argument. In situations where the `sever` buffer's lifetime is shorter than the `client` buffer's, this can cause a use after free. This could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary memory contents to the client. The crate`openssl` version 0.10.70 fixes the signature of `ssl::select_next_proto` to properly constrain the output buffer's lifetime to that of both input buffers. Users are advised to upgrade. In standard usage of `ssl::select_next_proto` in the callback passed to `SslContextBuilder::set_alpn_select_callback`, code is only affected if the `server` buffer is constructed *within* the callback.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24898", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.09%  0.17%  +0.08 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00009.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 4049-1] rust-openssl security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/pull/2360", "ref_desc": "Fix lifetimes in ssl::select_next_proto by sfackler \u00b7 Pull Request #2360 \u00b7 sfackler/rust-openssl \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://crates.io/crates/openssl", "ref_desc": "openssl - crates.io: Rust Package Registry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/security/advisories/GHSA-rpmj-rpgj-qmpm", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
