{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25290", "Description": "@octokit/request sends parameterized requests to GitHub\u2019s APIs with sensible defaults in browsers and Node. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 9.2.1, the regular expression `/<([^>]+)>; rel=\"deprecation\"/` used to match the `link` header in HTTP responses is vulnerable to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack. This vulnerability arises due to the unbounded nature of the regex's matching behavior, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted input. An attacker could exploit this flaw by sending a malicious `link` header, resulting in excessive CPU usage and potentially causing the server to become unresponsive, impacting service availability. Version 9.2.1 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25290", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-18  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/request.js/security/advisories/GHSA-rmvr-2pp2-xj38", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/request.js/commit/34ff07ee86fc5c20865982d77391bc910ef19c68", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 octokit/request.js@34ff07e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
