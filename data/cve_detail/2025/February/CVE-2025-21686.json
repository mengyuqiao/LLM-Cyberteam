{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-21686", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/rsrc: require cloned buffers to share accounting contexts\n\nWhen IORING_REGISTER_CLONE_BUFFERS is used to clone buffers from uring\ninstance A to uring instance B, where A and B use different MMs for\naccounting, the accounting can go wrong:\nIf uring instance A is closed before uring instance B, the pinned memory\ncounters for uring instance B will be decremented, even though the pinned\nmemory was originally accounted through uring instance A; so the MM of\nuring instance B can end up with negative locked memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21686", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.03%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19d340a2988d4f3e673cded9dde405d727d7e248", "ref_desc": "io_uring/rsrc: require cloned buffers to share accounting contexts - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/efd96fbe23fa87de39116f632401f67b93be21ab", "ref_desc": "io_uring/rsrc: require cloned buffers to share accounting contexts - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cafc60ae35f82ebf156b3245f979ca61cbb8e42c", "ref_desc": "io_uring/rsrc: require cloned buffers to share accounting contexts - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
