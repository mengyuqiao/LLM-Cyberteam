{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-25204", "Description": "`gh` is GitHub\u2019s official command line tool. Starting in version 2.49.0 and prior to version 2.67.0, under certain conditions, a bug in GitHub's Artifact Attestation cli tool `gh attestation verify` causes it to return a zero exit status when no attestations are present. This behavior is incorrect: When no attestations are present, `gh attestation verify` should return a non-zero exit status code, thereby signaling verification failure. An attacker can abuse this flaw to, for example, deploy malicious artifacts in any system that uses `gh attestation verify`'s exit codes to gatekeep deployments. Users are advised to update `gh` to patched version `v2.67.0` as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25204", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-18  0.04%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-390 Detection of Error Condition Without Action", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/390/Detection-of-Error-Condition-Without-Action.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-fgw4-v983-mgp8", "ref_desc": "`gh attestation verify` returns incorrect exit code during verification when predicate types mismatch \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cli/cli \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/10418", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/10421", "ref_desc": "Exit with error if no matching predicate type exists by kommendorkapten \u00b7 Pull Request #10421 \u00b7 cli/cli \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
