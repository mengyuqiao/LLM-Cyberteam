{"CVE Code": "CVE-2025-22866", "Description": "Due to the usage of a variable time instruction in the assembly implementation of an internal function, a small number of bits of secret scalars are leaked on the ppc64le architecture. Due to the way this function is used, we do not believe this leakage is enough to allow recovery of the private key when P-256 is used in any well known protocols.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22866", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 4 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-29  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-28  0.03%  0.02%  -0.01 \n 3  2025-03-27  0.02%  0.03%  +0.01 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.02%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.4", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3447", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://go.dev/issue/71383", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://go.dev/cl/643735", "ref_desc": "crypto/internal/fips140/nistec: make p256NegCond constant time on ppc64le (643735) \u00b7 Gerrit Code Review", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xU1ZCHUZw3k", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2025-22866 Golang Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
