{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40348", "Description": "Spacewalk 2.10, and derivatives such as Uyuni 2021.08, allows code injection. rhn-config-satellite.pl doesn't sanitize the configuration filename used to append Spacewalk-specific key-value pair. The script is intended to be run by the tomcat user account with Sudo, according to the installation setup. This can lead to the ability of an attacker to use --option to append arbitrary code to a root-owned file that eventually will be executed by the system. This is fixed in Uyuni spacewalk-admin 4.3.2-1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40348", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSpacewalk Project\u00bbSpacewalk\u00bbVersion:2.10cpe:2.3:a:spacewalk_project:spacewalk:2.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUyuni-project\u00bbUyuni\u00bbVersion:2021.08cpe:2.3:a:uyuni-project:uyuni:2021.08:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-27  0.42%  0.45%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.88%  0.42%  -0.46 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.42%  0.88%  +0.46 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.26%  0.42%  +0.17 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-07-17  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-06-07  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-05-25  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-04-14  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-18  0.12%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/commit/790c7388efac6923c5475e01c1ff718dffa9f052", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #4414 from uyuni-project/Uyuni-2021.09 \u00b7 uyuni-project/uyuni@790c738 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/28/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - spacewalk-admin: CVE-2021-40348: arbitrary local code execution by 'tomcat' user via rhn-config-satellite.plExploit;Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
