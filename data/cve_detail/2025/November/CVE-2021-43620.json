{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43620", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the fruity crate through 0.2.0 for Rust. Security-relevant validation of filename extensions is plausibly affected. Methods of NSString for conversion to a string may return a partial result. Because they call CStr::from_ptr on a pointer to the string buffer, the string is terminated at the first '\\0' byte, which might not be the end of the string.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43620", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFruity Project\u00bbFruity\u00bbVersion:0.1.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:fruity_project:fruity:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nFruity Project\u00bbFruity\u00bbVersion:0.2.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:fruity_project:fruity:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-11  0.29%  0.31%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.29%  0.26%  -0.03 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.14%  0.29%  +0.15 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-07-31  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-06-21  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-02-06  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-06-07  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-04-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0123.html", "ref_desc": "RUSTSEC-2021-0123: fruity: Converting `NSString` to a String Truncates at Null Bytes \u203a RustSec Advisory DatabaseExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nvzqz/fruity/issues/14", "ref_desc": "`Display` for `NSString` truncates at null bytes \u00b7 Issue #14 \u00b7 nvzqz/fruity \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/pull/1102", "ref_desc": "Add fruity advisory for nvzqz/fruity#14 by dylni \u00b7 Pull Request #1102 \u00b7 rustsec/advisory-db \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
