{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41281", "Description": "Synapse is a package for Matrix homeservers written in Python 3/Twisted. Prior to version 1.47.1, Synapse instances with the media repository enabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a remote server into an arbitrary directory. No authentication is required for the affected endpoint. The last 2 directories and file name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact. Homeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers with a federation whitelist are also unaffected, since Synapse will check the remote hostname, including the trailing `../`s, against the whitelist. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.47.1 or later. Server administrators using a reverse proxy could, at the expense of losing media functionality, may block the certain endpoints as a workaround. Alternatively, non-containerized deployments can be adapted to use the hardened systemd config.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41281", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.47.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-19  0.52%  0.55%  +0.03 \n 2  2025-03-30  1.06%  0.52%  -0.54 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.52%  1.06%  +0.54 \n 4  2025-03-20  0.44%  0.52%  +0.08 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.18%  0.44%  +0.26 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-08-08  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-06-29  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 9  2024-06-03  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-11-08  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-06-16  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.11%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.47.1 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/91f2bd090", "ref_desc": "Prevent the media store from writing outside of the configured directory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse@91f2bd0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N3WY56LCEZ4ZECLWV5KMAXF2PSMUB4F2/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: matrix-synapse-1.48.0-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c", "ref_desc": "Path traversal when downloading remote media \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EU7QRE55U4IUEDLKT5IYPWL3UXMELFAS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: matrix-synapse-1.48.0-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
