{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41278", "Description": "Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of the EdgeX IoT platform. In affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk \u201cAES\u201d transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an \u201caes\u201d transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the \u201caes\u201d transform and provides an improved \u201caes256\u201d transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation. As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the new \"aes256\" transform.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41278", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEdgexfoundry\u00bbEdgex FoundryVersions  before (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:edgexfoundry:edgex_foundry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEdgexfoundry\u00bbApp Service Configurable\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:edgexfoundry:app_service_configurable:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions\nEdgexfoundry\u00bbApplication Functions Software Development Kit\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:edgexfoundry:application_functions_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-14  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-11  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-05-01  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/commit/8fa13c6388ce76a6b878b54490eac61aa7d81165", "ref_desc": "feat(transforms): new AES 256 Encryption Transform (#984) \u00b7 edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go@8fa13c6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/security/advisories/GHSA-6c7m-qwxj-mvhp", "ref_desc": "Broken encryption in app-functions-sdk \u201cAES\u201d transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 edgexfoundry/app-functions-sThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
