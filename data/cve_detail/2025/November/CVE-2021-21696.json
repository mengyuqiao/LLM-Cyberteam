{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21696", "Description": "Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier does not limit agent read/write access to the libs/ directory inside build directories when using the FilePath APIs, allowing attackers in control of agent processes to replace the code of a trusted library with a modified variant. This results in unsandboxed code execution in the Jenkins controller process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21696", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.303.2cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenkins\u00bbJenkins\u00bbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.318cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  1.37%  1.06%  -0.31 \n 2  2025-06-01  1.06%  1.37%  +0.31 \n 3  2025-05-21  1.35%  1.06%  -0.29 \n 4  2025-05-04  1.37%  1.35%  -0.02 \n 5  2025-05-01  1.35%  1.37%  +0.02 \n 6  2025-04-30  1.64%  1.35%  -0.30 \n 7  2025-03-30  4.48%  1.64%  -2.84 \n 8  2025-03-29  1.64%  4.48%  +2.84 \n 9  2025-03-20  1.51%  1.64%  +0.14 \n 10  2025-03-17  0.52%  1.51%  +0.98 \n 11  2025-03-09  0.26%  0.52%  +0.26 \n 12  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.26%  -0.04 \n 13  2024-07-20  0.28%  0.30%  +0.02 \n 14  2024-06-10  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 15  2023-05-28  0.29%  0.27%  -0.02 \n 16  2023-03-07  2.10%  0.29%  -1.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/04/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins and Jenkins pluginsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MWsYgzGFQWKMjI9D1G0KCJ5L62w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-11-04/#SECURITY-2423", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2021-11-04Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
