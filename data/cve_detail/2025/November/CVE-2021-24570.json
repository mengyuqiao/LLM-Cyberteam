{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24570", "Description": "The Accept Donations with PayPal WordPress plugin before 1.3.1 offers a function to create donation buttons, which internally are posts. The process to create a new button is lacking a CSRF check. An attacker could use this to make an authenticated admin create a new button. Furthermore, one of the Button field is not escaped before being output in an attribute when editing a Button, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue as well.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24570", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nWpplugin\u00bbAccept Donations With Paypal\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 1.3.1cpe:2.3:a:wpplugin:accept_donations_with_paypal:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-27  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  3.97%  0.17%  -3.81 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.17%  3.97%  +3.81 \n 4  2025-03-24  1.02%  0.17%  -0.85 \n 5  2025-03-23  0.17%  1.02%  +0.85 \n 6  2025-03-20  0.15%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 7  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.15%  +0.08 \n 8  2023-05-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-04-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/5c73754c-eebe-424a-9d3b-ca83eb53bf87", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2608073/", "ref_desc": "Changeset 2608073 \u2013 WordPress Plugin RepositoryPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
