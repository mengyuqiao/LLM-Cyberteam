{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43398", "Description": "Crypto++ (aka Cryptopp) 8.6.0 and earlier contains a timing leakage in MakePublicKey(). There is a clear correlation between execution time and private key length, which may cause disclosure of the length information of the private key. This might allow attackers to conduct timing attacks. NOTE: this report is disputed by the vendor and multiple third parties. The execution-time differences are intentional. A user may make a choice of a longer key as a tradeoff between strength and performance. In making this choice, the amount of information leaked to an adversary is of infinitesimal value", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43398", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCryptopp\u00bbCrypto++Versions  up to, including, (<=) 8.6.0cpe:2.3:a:cryptopp:crypto\\+\\+:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-19  0.37%  0.50%  +0.13 \n 2  2025-03-30  1.73%  0.37%  -1.36 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.37%  1.73%  +1.36 \n 4  2025-03-20  0.43%  0.37%  -0.06 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.19%  0.43%  +0.24 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-10-10  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-07-20  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 9  2024-06-10  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-07-25  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-06-26  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 12  2023-05-28  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 13  2023-04-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 14  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.08%  -2.43 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/1080", "ref_desc": "Dangerous Correlation Between Key Length and Execution Time \u00b7 Issue #1080 \u00b7 weidai11/cryptopp \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cryptopp.com", "ref_desc": "Crypto++ Library 8.6 | Free C++ Class Library of Cryptographic SchemesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/1080#issuecomment-996492222", "ref_desc": "Correlation Between Key Length and Execution Time \u00b7 Issue #1080 \u00b7 weidai11/cryptopp \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
