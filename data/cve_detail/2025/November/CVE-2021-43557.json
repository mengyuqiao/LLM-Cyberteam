{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43557", "Description": "The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains \"^/internal/\", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43557", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbApisixVersions  before (<) 2.10.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:apisix:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "42.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-31  45.74%  42.46%  -3.28 \n 2  2025-04-22  47.95%  45.74%  -2.21 \n 3  2025-03-30  72.72%  47.95%  -24.78 \n 4  2025-03-29  47.95%  72.72%  +24.78 \n 5  2025-03-28  64.34%  47.95%  -16.39 \n 6  2025-03-27  47.95%  64.34%  +16.39 \n 7  2025-03-24  64.34%  47.95%  -16.39 \n 8  2025-03-23  47.95%  64.34%  +16.39 \n 9  2025-03-17  0.35%  47.95%  +47.60 \n 10  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.35%  +0.07 \n 11  2024-08-07  0.24%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 12  2024-06-28  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 13  2023-06-15  0.25%  0.20%  -0.05 \n 14  2023-05-05  0.26%  0.25%  0.00 \n 15  2023-03-07  1.25%  0.26%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/23/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: CVE-2021-43557: Apache APISIX: Path traversal in request_uri variableExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/18jyd458ptocr31rnkjs71w4h366mv7h", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-43557: Apache APISIX: Path traversal in request_uri variable-Apache Mail ArchivesExploit;Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/22/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-43557: Apache APISIX: Path traversal in request_uri variableMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/22/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: CVE-2021-43557: Apache APISIX: Path traversal in request_uri variableMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
