{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41196", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the Keras pooling layers can trigger a segfault if the size of the pool is 0 or if a dimension is negative. This is due to the TensorFlow's implementation of pooling operations where the values in the sliding window are not checked to be strictly positive. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41196", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.05%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-01-28  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-06-27  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-05-29  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/12b1ff82b3f26ff8de17e58703231d5a02ef1b8b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #51975 from yongtang:51936-max_pool3d \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@12b1ff8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/51936", "ref_desc": "tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D crashes \u00b7 Issue #51936 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-m539-j985-hcr8", "ref_desc": "Crash in `max_pool3d` when size argument is 0 or negative \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
