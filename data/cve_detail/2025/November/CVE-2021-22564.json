{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22564", "Description": "For certain valid JPEG XL images with a size slightly larger than an integer number of groups (256x256 pixels) when processing the groups out of order the decoder can perform an out of bounds copy of image pixels from an image buffer in the heap to another. This copy can occur when processing the right or bottom edges of the image, but only when groups are processed in certain order. Groups can be processed out of order in multi-threaded decoding environments with heavy thread load but also with images that contain the groups in an arbitrary order in the file. It is recommended to upgrade past 0.6.0 or patch with https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/pull/775", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22564", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLibjxl Project\u00bbLibjxlVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.6.0cpe:2.3:a:libjxl_project:libjxl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.06%  0.04%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-05-25  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/issues/708", "ref_desc": "Crash during multiple concurrent/parallel decoding \u00b7 Issue #708 \u00b7 libjxl/libjxl \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/pull/775", "ref_desc": "Fix out of bounds copy in LoadBorders() by deymo \u00b7 Pull Request #775 \u00b7 libjxl/libjxl \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
