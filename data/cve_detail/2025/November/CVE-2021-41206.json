{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41206", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions several TensorFlow operations are missing validation for the shapes of the tensor arguments involved in the call. Depending on the API, this can result in undefined behavior and segfault or `CHECK`-fail related crashes but in some scenarios writes and reads from heap populated arrays are also possible. We have discovered these issues internally via tooling while working on improving/testing GPU op determinism. As such, we don't have reproducers and there will be multiple fixes for these issues. These fixes will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41206", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 1 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.02%  0.01%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.01%  0.02%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.01%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.05%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-354 Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/354/Improper-Validation-of-Integrity-Check-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-pgcq-h79j-2f69", "ref_desc": "Incomplete validation of shapes in multiple TF ops \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/da4aad5946be30e5f049920fa076e1f7ef021261", "ref_desc": "Roll forward https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ab0ca4bb\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@da4aad5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/68422b215e618df5ad375bcdc6d2052e9fd3080a", "ref_desc": "Add shape checks to GPU TridiagonalMatMul. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@68422b2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4dddb2fd0b01cdd196101afbba6518658a2c9e07", "ref_desc": "Fix segfault in pools on empty shapes when certain dimension were ver\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@4dddb2f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e7f497570abb6b4ae5af4970620cd880e4c0c904", "ref_desc": "Fix segfault on OOM in Conv2D. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@e7f4975 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/579261dcd446385831fe4f7457d802a59685121d", "ref_desc": "Fix crash in MatrixSolve when inputs have different batch dimensions. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@579261d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4d74d8a00b07441cba090a02e0dd9ed385145bf4", "ref_desc": "Fix crash in softmax-xent when some input dimensions are 1. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@4d74d8a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
