{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43282", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Victure WR1200 devices through 1.0.3. The default Wi-Fi WPA2 key is advertised to anyone within Wi-Fi range through the router's MAC address. The device default Wi-Fi password corresponds to the last 4 bytes of the MAC address of its 2.4 GHz network interface controller (NIC). An attacker within scanning range of the Wi-Fi network can thus scan for Wi-Fi networks to obtain the default key.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43282", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGovicture\u00bbWr1200 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.3cpe:2.3:o:govicture:wr1200_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Govicture\u00bbWr1200\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.37%  0.18%  -0.19 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.18%  0.37%  +0.19 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.18%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 5  2024-08-15  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-23  0.08%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-05-13  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/11/12/technical-advisory-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-victure-wr1200-wifi-router-cve-2021-43282-cve-2021-43283-cve-2021-43284/", "ref_desc": "Technical Advisory \u2013 Multiple Vulnerabilities in Victure WR1200 WiFi Router (CVE-2021-43282, CVE-2021-43283, CVE-2021-43284) \u2013 NCC Group ResearchExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gQLKBK5_RWG4zazUf88zUB5pyvc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/?research=Technical+advisories", "ref_desc": "NCC Group Research \u2013 Making the world safer and more secureExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XUwwoLF-TRTSEEpJFAHawTspq3Y.html"}]}
