{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40131", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by adding malicious code to the configuration by using the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40131", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbCommon Services Platform CollectorVersions  before (<) 2.9.1.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:common_services_platform_collector:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.24%  0.21%  -0.03 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 3  2025-03-20  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.18%  +0.11 \n 5  2023-06-11  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.07%  -1.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-87 Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/87/Improper-Neutralization-of-Alternate-XSS-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-CSPC-XSS-KjrNbM3p", "ref_desc": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
