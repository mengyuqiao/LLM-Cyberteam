{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41263", "Description": "rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications. In affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41263", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbRails Multisite\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:a:discourse:rails_multisite:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-11  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.21%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.19%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.19%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-06-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-28  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-565 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/565/Reliance-on-Cookies-without-Validation-and-Integrity-Checkin.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/rails_multisite/commit/c6785cdb5c9277dd2c5ac8d55180dd1ece440ed0", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Vary the encrypted/signed cookie salts per-hostname (#26) \u00b7 discourse/rails_multisite@c6785cd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/rails_multisite/security/advisories/GHSA-844m-cpr9-jcmh", "ref_desc": "Secure/signed cookies share secrets between sites in a multi-site application \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/rails_multisite \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
