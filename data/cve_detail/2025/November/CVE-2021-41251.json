{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41251", "Description": "@sap-cloud-sdk/core contains the core functionality of the SAP Cloud SDK as well as the SAP Business Technology Platform abstractions. This affects applications on SAP Business Technology Platform that use the SAP Cloud SDK and enabled caching of destinations. In affected versions and in some cases, when user information was missing, destinations were cached without user information, allowing other users to retrieve the same destination with its permissions. By default, destination caching is disabled. The security for caching has been increased. The changes are released in version 1.52.0. Users unable to upgrade are advised to disable destination caching (it is disabled by default).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41251", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbCloud Sdk\u00bbForJavaVersions  before (<) 1.52.0cpe:2.3:a:sap:cloud_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:java:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-01  0.31%  0.33%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.61%  0.31%  -0.30 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.31%  0.61%  +0.30 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.19%  0.31%  +0.13 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-09-27  0.19%  0.18%  0.00 \n 7  2024-07-21  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-01-28  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-05-29  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-04-18  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/pull/1769", "ref_desc": "fix: wrong token for cache by FrankEssenberger \u00b7 Pull Request #1769 \u00b7 SAP/cloud-sdk-js \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/security/advisories/GHSA-gp2f-254m-rh32", "ref_desc": "Possibility to elevate privileges or get unauthorized access to data \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 SAP/cloud-sdk-js \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/pull/1770", "ref_desc": "Fix: destination cache vulnerablity by jjtang1985 \u00b7 Pull Request #1770 \u00b7 SAP/cloud-sdk-js \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
