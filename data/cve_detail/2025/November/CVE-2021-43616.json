{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43616", "Description": "The npm ci command in npm 7.x and 8.x through 8.1.3 proceeds with an installation even if dependency information in package-lock.json differs from package.json. This behavior is inconsistent with the documentation, and makes it easier for attackers to install malware that was supposed to have been blocked by an exact version match requirement in package-lock.json. NOTE: The npm team believes this is not a vulnerability. It would require someone to socially engineer package.json which has different dependencies than package-lock.json. That user would have to have file system or write access to change dependencies. The npm team states preventing malicious actors from socially engineering or gaining file system access is outside the scope of the npm CLI.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43616", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbNext Generation Application Programming Interface\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:next_generation_application_programming_interface:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNpmjs\u00bbNPMVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.1.3cpe:2.3:a:npmjs:npm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNpmjs\u00bbNPMVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.24.2cpe:2.3:a:npmjs:npm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.77% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-03  0.81%  0.77%  -0.05 \n 2  2025-03-30  3.34%  0.81%  -2.53 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.81%  3.34%  +2.53 \n 4  2025-03-28  3.34%  0.81%  -2.53 \n 5  2025-03-27  0.81%  3.34%  +2.53 \n 6  2025-03-17  1.98%  0.81%  -1.17 \n 7  2024-12-17  2.46%  1.98%  -0.48 \n 8  2024-07-29  1.81%  2.46%  +0.66 \n 9  2024-06-19  1.52%  1.81%  +0.28 \n 10  2024-02-05  1.18%  1.52%  +0.34 \n 11  2023-11-08  0.84%  1.18%  +0.35 \n 12  2023-07-05  0.67%  0.84%  +0.16 \n 13  2023-06-21  0.55%  0.67%  +0.12 \n 14  2023-06-06  0.57%  0.55%  -0.01 \n 15  2023-04-26  0.48%  0.57%  +0.09 \n 16  2023-03-07  1.54%  0.48%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2701#issuecomment-979054224", "ref_desc": "[BUG] `npm ci` succeeds when `package-lock.json` doesn't match `package.json` \u00b7 Issue #2701 \u00b7 npm/cli \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/icatalina/CVE-2021-43616", "ref_desc": "GitHub - icatalina/CVE-2021-43616: Repo demonstrating CVE-2021-43616 / https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2701Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211210-0002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-43616 NPM Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2701", "ref_desc": "[BUG] `npm ci` succeeds when `package-lock.json` doesn't match `package.json` \u00b7 Issue #2701 \u00b7 npm/cli \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://medium.com/cider-sec/this-time-we-were-lucky-85c0dcac94a0", "ref_desc": "Our dependencies are under attack, and this time we were lucky\u2026 | by Rotem Bar | Cider Security | Nov, 2021 | MediumExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NXNVFKOF5ZYH5NIRWHKN6O6UBCHDV6FE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: nodejs-16.14.0-2.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NXNVFKOF5ZYH5NIRWHKN6O6UBCHDV6FE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: nodejs-16.14.0-2.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-ci", "ref_desc": "npm-ci | npm DocsProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2701#issuecomment-972900511", "ref_desc": "[BUG] `npm ci` succeeds when `package-lock.json` doesn't match `package.json` \u00b7 Issue #2701 \u00b7 npm/cli \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-ci", "ref_desc": "npm-ci | npm Docs", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/npm/cli/commit/457e0ae61bbc55846f5af44afa4066921923490f", "ref_desc": "fix(ci): lock file validation \u00b7 npm/cli@457e0ae \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
