{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43174", "Description": "NLnet Labs Routinator versions 0.9.0 up to and including 0.10.1, support the gzip transfer encoding when querying RRDP repositories. This encoding can be used by an RRDP repository to cause an out-of-memory crash in these versions of Routinator. RRDP uses XML which allows arbitrary amounts of white space in the encoded data. The gzip scheme compresses such white space extremely well, leading to very small compressed files that become huge when being decompressed for further processing, big enough that Routinator runs out of memory when parsing input data waiting for the next XML element.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43174", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNlnetlabs\u00bbRoutinatorVersions  from including (>=) 0.9.0andbefore (<) 0.10.2cpe:2.3:a:nlnetlabs:routinator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.72% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-10  0.72%  0.72%  0.00 \n 2  2025-04-07  0.86%  0.72%  -0.14 \n 3  2025-03-30  1.77%  0.86%  -0.92 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.86%  1.77%  +0.92 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.12%  0.86%  +0.74 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.12%  -0.02 \n 7  2024-09-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 8  2024-07-25  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 9  2024-06-15  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-06-02  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-04-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1325 Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1325/Improperly-Controlled-Sequential-Memory-Allocation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/routinator/CVE-2021-43172_CVE-2021-43173_CVE-2021-43174.txt", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/juHi7HhcTzkRXODUgq515OYN7YU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5041", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5041-1 cfrpkiThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Qn6xZJOn0yWX-lUu1Uy9biJ8Juk.html"}]}
