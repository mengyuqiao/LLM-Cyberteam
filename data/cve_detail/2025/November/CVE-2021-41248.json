{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41248", "Description": "GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41248", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGraphql\u00bbGraphiql\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 0.5.0andbefore (<) 1.4.7cpe:2.3:a:graphql:graphiql:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-30  0.38%  0.40%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.54%  0.38%  -0.16 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.38%  0.54%  +0.16 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.08%  0.38%  +0.30 \n 5  2024-07-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-06-10  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-05-28  0.09%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-04-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/commit/cb237eeeaf7333c4954c752122261db7520f7bf4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8 \u00b7 graphql/graphiql@cb237ee \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability in GraphQL Playground from untrusted schemas \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 graphql/graphql-playground \u00b7 GitHubNot Applicable;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HS6f44Zi5Tlnf7YiaUC23qpKSr8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8", "ref_desc": "GraphiQL introspection schema template injection attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 graphql/graphiql \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nTdTlBv8XdN4JeGeHcQUaFNvReM.html"}]}
