{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41264", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. In affected versions upgradeable contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` may be vulnerable to an attack affecting uninitialized implementation contracts. A fix is included in version 4.3.2 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`. For users unable to upgrade; initialize implementation contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` by invoking the initializer function (usually called `initialize`). An example is provided [in the forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/security-advisory-initialize-uups-implementation-contracts/15301).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41264", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.3.2cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.24%  0.64%  -0.60 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.64%  1.24%  +0.60 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.25%  0.64%  +0.39 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.35%  0.25%  -0.10 \n 5  2024-07-28  0.32%  0.35%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-06-18  0.32%  0.32%  +0.00 \n 7  2024-05-23  0.30%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-07-04  0.27%  0.30%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-06-20  0.23%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-06-05  0.23%  0.23%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-04-25  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.20%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-665 Improper Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/665/Improper-Initialization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/security-advisory-initialize-uups-implementation-contracts/15301", "ref_desc": "Security advisory: Initialize UUPS implementation contracts - General / Announcements - OpenZeppelin CommunityIssue Tracking;Mitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/024cc50df478d2e8f78539819749e94d6df60592", "ref_desc": "Restrict upgrade to proxy context in UUPSUpgradeable \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@024cc50 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-5vp3-v4hc-gx76", "ref_desc": "UUPSUpgradeable vulnerability in OpenZeppelin Contracts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
