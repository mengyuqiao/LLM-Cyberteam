{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43979", "Description": "Styra Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper through 3.7.0 mishandles concurrency, sometimes resulting in incorrect access control. The data replication mechanism allows policies to access the Kubernetes cluster state. During data replication, OPA/Gatekeeper does not wait for the replication to finish before processing a request, which might cause inconsistencies between the replicated resources in OPA/Gatekeeper and the resources actually present in the cluster. Inconsistency can later be reflected in a policy bypass. NOTE: the vendor disagrees that this is a vulnerability, because Kubernetes states are only eventually consistent", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43979", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenpolicyagent\u00bbGatekeeperVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.7.0cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:gatekeeper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-13  0.22%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.20%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.22%  0.20%  -0.03 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.07%  0.22%  +0.16 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 6  2024-08-02  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-06-23  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-02-08  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-06-10  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-04-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hkerma/opa-gatekeeper-concurrency-issue", "ref_desc": "GitHub - hkerma/opa-gatekeeper-concurrency-issue: PoC of a concurrency issue in OPA/Gatekeeper using data replicationThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 open-policy-agent/gatekeeper \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
