{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41244", "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions when the fine-grained access control beta feature is enabled and there is more than one organization in the Grafana instance admins are able to access users from other organizations. Grafana 8.0 introduced a mechanism which allowed users with the Organization Admin role to list, add, remove, and update users\u2019 roles in other organizations in which they are not an admin. With fine-grained access control enabled, organization admins can list, add, remove and update users' roles in another organization, where they do not have organization admin role. All installations between v8.0 and v8.2.3 that have fine-grained access control beta enabled and more than one organization should be upgraded as soon as possible. If you cannot upgrade, you should turn off the fine-grained access control using a feature flag.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41244", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.2.4cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.53% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-15  0.55%  0.53%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-04-29  0.44%  0.55%  +0.11 \n 3  2025-04-24  0.38%  0.44%  +0.05 \n 4  2025-04-07  0.37%  0.38%  +0.01 \n 5  2025-04-05  0.39%  0.37%  -0.02 \n 6  2025-03-30  1.18%  0.39%  -0.79 \n 7  2025-03-29  0.39%  1.18%  +0.79 \n 8  2025-03-18  0.37%  0.39%  +0.02 \n 9  2025-03-17  0.15%  0.37%  +0.22 \n 10  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.15%  -0.16 \n 11  2023-10-02  0.37%  0.31%  -0.06 \n 12  2023-07-07  0.32%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 13  2023-06-23  0.31%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 14  2023-06-08  0.21%  0.31%  +0.10 \n 15  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.21%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://grafana.com/blog/2021/11/15/grafana-8.2.4-released-with-security-fixes/", "ref_desc": "Grafana 8.2.4 released with security fixes | Grafana LabsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-mpwp-42x6-4wmx", "ref_desc": "Fine-grained access control enables organization admins to create/modify/delete user roles in other organization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/15/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Grafana 8.2.4 released with security fixesMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211223-0001/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-41244 Grafana Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
