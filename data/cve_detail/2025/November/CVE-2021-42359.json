{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-42359", "Description": "WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, \u2018admin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u2018, which lacked a capability check and a nonce check and was available to unauthenticated users, and did not check the post type when deleting unsubscription requests. As such, it was possible for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the site by sending an AJAX request with the \u201caction\u201d parameter set to \u201cadmin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u201d and the \u201cid\u201d parameter set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42359", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nLegalweb\u00bbWp Dsgvo Tools\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.1.23cpe:2.3:a:legalweb:wp_dsgvo_tools:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  35.61%  1.45%  -34.16 \n 2  2025-03-29  1.45%  35.61%  +34.16 \n 3  2025-03-24  14.87%  1.45%  -13.43 \n 4  2025-03-23  1.45%  14.87%  +13.43 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.17%  1.45%  +1.28 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 7  2024-07-21  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-06-11  0.11%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-05-29  0.15%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 10  2023-04-18  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/11/vulnerability-in-wp-dsgvo-tools-gdpr-plugin-allows-unauthenticated-page-deletion/", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) Plugin Allows Unauthenticated Page DeletionExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
