{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43780", "Description": "Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43780", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nRedash\u00bbRedashVersions  before (<) 10.0.1cpe:2.3:a:redash:redash:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  0.24%  0.19%  -0.05 \n 2  2025-06-01  0.19%  0.24%  +0.05 \n 3  2025-05-19  0.22%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 4  2025-05-04  0.23%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 5  2025-05-01  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 6  2025-03-30  0.42%  0.22%  -0.21 \n 7  2025-03-29  0.22%  0.42%  +0.21 \n 8  2025-03-17  0.10%  0.22%  +0.11 \n 9  2023-06-16  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-06  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getredash/redash/security/advisories/GHSA-fcpv-hgq6-87h7", "ref_desc": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Redash \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getredash/redash \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getredash/redash/commit/61bbb5aa7a23a93f2f93710005f71bc972826099", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-fcpv-hgq6-87h7 \u00b7 getredash/redash@61bbb5a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
