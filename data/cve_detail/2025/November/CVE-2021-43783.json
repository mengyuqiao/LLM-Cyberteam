{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43783", "Description": "@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend is the backend for the default Backstage software templates. In affected versions a malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template is able to manipulate the template in a way that writes files to arbitrary paths on the scaffolder-backend host instance. This vulnerability can in some situation also be exploited through user input when executing a template, meaning you do not need write access to the templates. This method will not allow the attacker to control the contents of the injected file however, unless the template is also crafted in a specific way that gives control of the file contents. This vulnerability is fixed in version `0.15.14` of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`. This attack is mitigated by restricting access and requiring reviews when registering or modifying scaffolder templates.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43783", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbBackstageVersions  before (<) 0.15.14cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:backstage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-25  0.34%  0.35%  +0.02 \n 2  2025-03-30  0.40%  0.34%  -0.06 \n 3  2025-03-29  0.34%  0.40%  +0.06 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.08%  0.34%  +0.26 \n 5  2023-06-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/f9352ab606367cd9efc6ff048915c70ed3013b7f", "ref_desc": "scaffolder-backend: removed all usaged and prevent new usage of path.\u2026 \u00b7 backstage/backstage@f9352ab \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-mg3m-f475-28hv", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal in @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend fetch:template action \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
