{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41195", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation of `tf.math.segment_*` operations results in a `CHECK`-fail related abort (and denial of service) if a segment id in `segment_ids` is large. This is similar to CVE-2021-29584 (and similar other reported vulnerabilities in TensorFlow, localized to specific APIs): the implementation (both on CPU and GPU) computes the output shape using `AddDim`. However, if the number of elements in the tensor overflows an `int64_t` value, `AddDim` results in a `CHECK` failure which provokes a `std::abort`. Instead, code should use `AddDimWithStatus`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41195", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.04%  -0.06 \n 4  2024-01-28  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46888", "ref_desc": "tf.math.segment_max/min/mean/sun/prod crashes(aborts) when segment_ids is large \u00b7 Issue #46888 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51733", "ref_desc": "Fix tf.math.segment_max/min/mean/sun/prod crashes(aborts) when segment_ids is large by yongtang \u00b7 Pull Request #51733 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7dcfVU2C9BFLbDMe5Hu654AXGBg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cq76-mxrc-vchh", "ref_desc": "Crash in `tf.math.segment_*` operations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e9c81c1e1a9cd8dd31f4e83676cab61b60658429", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #51733 from yongtang:46888-tf.math.segment_ \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@e9c81c1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
