{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22968", "Description": "A bypass of adding remote files in Concrete CMS (previously concrete5) File Manager leads to remote code execution in Concrete CMS (concrete5) versions 8.5.6 and below.The external file upload feature stages files in the public directory even if they have disallowed file extensions. They are stored in a directory with a random name, but it's possible to stall the uploads and brute force the directory name. You have to be an admin with the ability to upload files, but this bug gives you the ability to upload restricted file types and execute them depending on server configuration.To fix this, a check for allowed file extensions was added before downloading files to a tmp directory.Concrete CMS Security Team gave this a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.4 AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:NThis fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22968", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nConcretecms\u00bbConcrete CmsVersions  before (<) 8.5.7cpe:2.3:a:concretecms:concrete_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.67% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-06  2.53%  2.67%  +0.14 \n 2  2025-06-01  2.67%  2.53%  -0.14 \n 3  2025-05-15  2.53%  2.67%  +0.14 \n 4  2025-05-05  2.53%  2.53%  0.00 \n 5  2025-05-01  2.53%  2.53%  +0.00 \n 6  2025-04-14  2.53%  2.53%  0.00 \n 7  2025-04-13  2.53%  2.53%  +0.00 \n 8  2025-04-02  2.53%  2.53%  0.00 \n 9  2025-04-01  2.53%  2.53%  +0.00 \n 10  2025-03-30  3.50%  2.53%  -0.97 \n 11  2025-03-29  2.53%  3.50%  +0.97 \n 12  2025-03-28  2.53%  2.53%  +0.00 \n 13  2025-03-18  2.53%  2.53%  0.00 \n 14  2025-03-17  0.29%  2.53%  +2.24 \n 15  2024-12-17  0.98%  0.29%  -0.69 \n 16  2024-05-03  0.95%  0.98%  +0.03 \n 17  2024-02-11  0.90%  0.95%  +0.04 \n 18  2023-11-05  0.90%  0.90%  +0.01 \n 19  2023-09-08  0.89%  0.90%  +0.01 \n 20  2023-08-09  0.81%  0.89%  +0.08 \n 21  2023-07-25  0.40%  0.81%  +0.41 \n 22  2023-07-01  0.57%  0.40%  -0.17 \n 23  2023-06-27  0.40%  0.57%  +0.17 \n 24  2023-06-12  0.42%  0.40%  -0.02 \n 25  2023-03-07  2.43%  0.42%  -2.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-98 Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/98/Improper-Control-of-Filename-for-Include-Require-Statement-i.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://documentation.concretecms.org/developers/introduction/version-history/857-release-notes", "ref_desc": "8.5.7 Release Notes :: Concrete CMSRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mIGQ9QLuMDSeQJFUtb_9GXFEHQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1350444", "ref_desc": "#1350444 A bypass of adding remote files in concrete5 FIlemanager leads to remote code executionExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
