{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41200", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions if `tf.summary.create_file_writer` is called with non-scalar arguments code crashes due to a `CHECK`-fail. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41200", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.09%  0.05%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-01-28  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-06-27  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-05-29  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/874bda09e6702cd50bac90b453b50bcc65b2769e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #51715 from yongtang:46909-tf.summary.create_file_\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@874bda0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-gh8h-7j2j-qv4f", "ref_desc": "Incomplete validation in `tf.summary.create_file_writer` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46909", "ref_desc": "tf.summary.create_file_writer aborts \u00b7 Issue #46909 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
