{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43562", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the pixxio (aka pixx.io integration or DAM) extension before 1.0.6 for TYPO3. The extension fails to restrict the image download to the configured pixx.io DAM URL, resulting in SSRF. As a result, an attacker can download various content from a remote location and save it to a user-controlled filename, which may result in Remote Code Execution. A TYPO3 backend user account is required to exploit this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43562", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nPixxio\u00bbPixx.io\u00bbForTypo3Versions  before (<) 1.0.6cpe:2.3:a:pixxio:pixx.io:*:*:*:*:*:typo3:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  6.18%  1.47%  -4.71 \n 2  2025-03-29  1.47%  6.18%  +4.71 \n 3  2025-03-20  1.28%  1.47%  +0.19 \n 4  2025-03-17  0.23%  1.28%  +1.05 \n 5  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.23%  -0.08 \n 6  2024-04-24  0.30%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-02-02  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-10-26  0.26%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-06-18  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-06-03  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.22%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-ext-sa-2021-017", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-EXT-SA-2021-017: Multiple vulnerabilities in extension \"pixx.io integration for TYPO3 (DAM)\" (pixxio)Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7S_q6MDaECfZFcjoaYT8njWcskk.html"}]}
