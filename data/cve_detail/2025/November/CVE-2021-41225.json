{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41225", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer has a use of unitialized variable. If the `train_nodes` vector (obtained from the saved model that gets optimized) does not contain a `Dequeue` node, then `dequeue_node` is left unitialized. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41225", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 3 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.02%  0.04%  +0.02 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-05-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/908/Use-of-Uninitialized-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/68867bf01239d9e1048f98cbad185bf4761bedd3", "ref_desc": "Prevent unitialized variable use in grappler. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@68867bf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-7r94-xv9v-63jw", "ref_desc": "A use of uninitialized value vulnerability in Tensorflow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
