{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-42694", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the character definitions of the Unicode Specification through 14.0. The specification allows an adversary to produce source code identifiers such as function names using homoglyphs that render visually identical to a target identifier. Adversaries can leverage this to inject code via adversarial identifier definitions in upstream software dependencies invoked deceptively in downstream software. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of international text that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard (all versions). Unless mitigated, an adversary could produce source code identifiers using homoglyph characters that render visually identical to but are distinct from a target identifier. In this way, an adversary could inject adversarial identifier definitions in upstream software that are not detected by human reviewers and are invoked deceptively in downstream software. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of security vulnerability in its document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42694", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nUnicode\u00bbUnicodeVersions  before (<) 14.0.0cpe:2.3:a:unicode:unicode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "12.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-04-10  9.58%  12.47%  +2.89 \n 2  2025-03-30  38.19%  9.58%  -28.61 \n 3  2025-03-29  9.58%  38.19%  +28.61 \n 4  2025-03-28  38.19%  9.58%  -28.61 \n 5  2025-03-27  9.58%  38.19%  +28.61 \n 6  2025-03-22  10.10%  9.58%  -0.52 \n 7  2025-03-17  0.75%  10.10%  +9.35 \n 8  2025-02-02  0.91%  0.75%  -0.16 \n 9  2024-12-17  0.54%  0.91%  +0.37 \n 10  2024-10-30  0.32%  0.54%  +0.22 \n 11  2024-07-17  0.31%  0.32%  +0.02 \n 12  2024-06-07  0.30%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-06-22  0.31%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 14  2023-06-08  0.31%  0.31%  0.00 \n 15  2023-05-24  0.32%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 16  2023-05-08  0.21%  0.32%  +0.11 \n 17  2023-04-13  0.17%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 18  2023-03-07  12.26%  0.17%  -12.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1007 Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1007/Insufficient-Visual-Distinction-of-Homoglyphs-Presented-to-U.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/", "ref_desc": "UTS #39: Unicode Security MechanismsTechnical Description;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-ZAEHFroxShINqgoL7LInjiN28I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-09", "ref_desc": "Rust: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202210-09) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Cky_3iN_cRVTOXZy3dYrHl8m7WA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/", "ref_desc": "Unicode 14.0.0Release Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eDHdAUjbEiKiy6hjFcES3yxd43k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://trojansource.codes", "ref_desc": "Trojan Source AttacksThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fUOUjlYbuMjKhDm9UB6UliPNObY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/999008", "ref_desc": "VU#999008 - Compilers permit Unicode control and homoglyph charactersThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RN8BDek_UACE_oj0GRKM4x22wOk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/", "ref_desc": "UTR #36: Unicode Security ConsiderationsTechnical Description;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/So9-ULEJ043ZqHBTq1VbRAG6it0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/01/6", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Trojan Source AttacksMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sy618RJ_VuGIyoh2cphKaKyQOGs.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/01/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-42574: rustc 1.56.0 and bidirectional-override codepoints in source codeMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U2VYduFuinRRWTLzyTt-D--zd2E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1007.html", "ref_desc": "CWE - CWE-1007: Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User (4.7)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.scyon.nl/post/trojans-in-your-source-code", "ref_desc": "Trojans in your source codeExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zl9tcXu4WYL9egOiBnJZ7AzLjkI.html"}]}
