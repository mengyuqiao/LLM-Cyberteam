{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41202", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions while calculating the size of the output within the `tf.range` kernel, there is a conditional statement of type `int64 = condition ? int64 : double`. Due to C++ implicit conversion rules, both branches of the condition will be cast to `double` and the result would be truncated before the assignment. This result in overflows. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41202", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-681 Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/681/Incorrect-Conversion-between-Numeric-Types.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-xrqm-fpgr-6hhx", "ref_desc": "Overflow/crash in `tf.range` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1b0e0ec27e7895b9985076eab32445026ae5ca94", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #51711 from yongtang:46899-tf.range \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@1b0e0ec \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46889", "ref_desc": "tf.keras.backend.arange crash (abort) when start is large \u00b7 Issue #46889 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46912", "ref_desc": "`tf.sparse.eye` crashes(aborts) when num_rows contains large number \u00b7 Issue #46912 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6d94002a09711d297dbba90390d5482b76113899", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #51359 from yongtang:46913-range-overflow \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@6d94002 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
