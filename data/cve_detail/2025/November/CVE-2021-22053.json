{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22053", "Description": "Applications using both `spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-dashboard` and `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf` expose a way to execute code submitted within the request URI path during the resolution of view templates. When a request is made at `/hystrix/monitor;[user-provided data]`, the path elements following `hystrix/monitor` are being evaluated as SpringEL expressions, which can lead to code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22053", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbSpring Cloud NetflixVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.10cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_cloud_netflix:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "87.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-06-04  82.34%  87.38%  +5.04 \n 2  2025-06-01  88.67%  82.34%  -6.32 \n 3  2025-05-15  89.16%  88.67%  -0.49 \n 4  2025-05-04  86.21%  89.16%  +2.95 \n 5  2025-05-01  89.16%  86.21%  -2.95 \n 6  2025-03-30  90.49%  89.16%  -1.33 \n 7  2025-03-29  89.16%  90.49%  +1.33 \n 8  2025-03-28  90.64%  89.16%  -1.48 \n 9  2025-03-27  89.16%  90.64%  +1.48 \n 10  2025-03-26  87.88%  89.16%  +1.28 \n 11  2025-03-24  89.16%  87.88%  -1.28 \n 12  2025-03-23  87.88%  89.16%  +1.28 \n 13  2025-03-18  89.16%  87.88%  -1.28 \n 14  2025-03-17  80.97%  89.16%  +8.19 \n 15  2025-02-20  79.90%  80.97%  +1.07 \n 16  2024-12-17  51.69%  79.90%  +28.22 \n 17  2024-12-06  48.34%  51.69%  +3.35 \n 18  2024-11-22  55.98%  48.34%  -7.64 \n 19  2024-11-07  58.88%  55.98%  -2.90 \n 20  2024-09-27  62.77%  58.88%  -3.89 \n 21  2024-08-30  54.05%  62.77%  +8.72 \n 22  2024-04-06  51.94%  54.05%  +2.11 \n 23  2024-01-13  59.41%  51.94%  -7.47 \n 24  2023-11-16  63.18%  59.41%  -3.77 \n 25  2023-10-19  65.51%  63.18%  -2.33 \n 26  2023-09-08  71.63%  65.51%  -6.12 \n 27  2023-06-12  70.87%  71.63%  +0.76 \n 28  2023-05-30  73.92%  70.87%  -3.05 \n 29  2023-05-02  80.69%  73.92%  -6.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22053", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-22053: Spring Cloud Netflix Hystrix Dashboard template resolution vulnerability | Security | VMware TanzuVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
