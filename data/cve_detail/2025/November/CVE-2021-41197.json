{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41197", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow allows tensor to have a large number of dimensions and each dimension can be as large as desired. However, the total number of elements in a tensor must fit within an `int64_t`. If an overflow occurs, `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` would return a negative result. In the majority of TensorFlow codebase this then results in a `CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs exist which return a `Status` instead of crashing the binary. This is similar to CVE-2021-29584. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41197", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.02% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-05-26  0.04%  0.02%  -0.01 \n 2  2025-05-17  0.02%  0.04%  +0.01 \n 3  2025-03-30  0.04%  0.02%  -0.02 \n 4  2025-03-29  0.02%  0.04%  +0.02 \n 5  2025-03-17  0.11%  0.02%  -0.09 \n 6  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-28  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-06-27  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-06-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/51908", "ref_desc": "tf.pad crashes with large paddings \u00b7 Issue #51908 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a871989d7b6c18cdebf2fb4f0e5c5b62fbc19edf", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #51658 from yongtang:51618-tf.image.extract_glimpse \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@a871989 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46890", "ref_desc": "tf.image.resize/resize_with_crop_or_pad/pad_to_bounding_box/extract_glimpse crash(abort) \u00b7 Issue #46890 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-prcg-wp5q-rv7p", "ref_desc": "Crashes due to overflow and `CHECK`-fail in ops with large tensor shapes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d81b1351da3e8c884ff836b64458d94e4a157c15", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #51717 from yongtang:46890-tf.image.pad_to_boundin\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@d81b135 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7c1692bd417eb4f9b33ead749a41166d6080af85", "ref_desc": "PR #51732: Fix crash of tf.image.crop_and_resize when input is large \u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@7c1692b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
