{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43581", "Description": "An Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability exists when reading a U3D file using Open Design Alliance PRC SDK before 2022.11. The specific issue exists within the parsing of U3D files. Incorrect use of the LibJpeg source manager inside the U3D library, and crafted data in a U3D file, can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43581", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpendesign\u00bbPrc SdkVersions  before (<) 2022.11cpe:2.3:a:opendesign:prc_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2025-03-30  1.13%  0.51%  -0.62 \n 2  2025-03-29  0.51%  1.13%  +0.62 \n 3  2025-03-17  0.44%  0.51%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-12-09  0.52%  0.44%  -0.08 \n 5  2024-10-28  0.49%  0.52%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-08-07  0.54%  0.49%  -0.05 \n 7  2024-06-28  0.28%  0.54%  +0.25 \n 8  2023-09-11  0.25%  0.28%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-06-15  0.28%  0.25%  -0.03 \n 10  2023-05-05  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.27%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.opendesign.com/security-advisories", "ref_desc": "ODA Security Advisories | Open Design AllianceVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0nfh8pGQ_z9zByY3PmWDSBBErgk.html"}]}
