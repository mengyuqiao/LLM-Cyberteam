{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24336", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Contiki through 3.0 and Contiki-NG through 4.5. The code for parsing Type A domain name answers in ip64-dns64.c doesn't verify whether the address in the answer's length is sane. Therefore, when copying an address of an arbitrary length, a buffer overflow can occur. This bug can be exploited whenever NAT64 is enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24336", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-os\u00bbContikiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.0cpe:2.3:o:contiki-os:contiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.5cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-27  5.20%  4.23%  -0.97 \n 2  2023-07-18  7.07%  5.20%  -1.87 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  7.07%  +6.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815128", "ref_desc": "VU#815128 - Embedded TCP/IP stacks have memory corruption vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-FUlxT2jz69AbCp7LSKOixlsgNQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-343-01", "ref_desc": "Multiple Embedded TCP/IP Stacks | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GksSr3Ut2DFDp7UMd6qt_iwyAl8.html"}]}
