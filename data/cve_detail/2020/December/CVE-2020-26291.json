{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26291", "Description": "URI.js is a javascript URL mutation library (npm package urijs). In URI.js before version 1.19.4, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\\`) character followed by an at (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect. Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior. For example the URL `https://expected-example.com\\@observed-example.com` will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version. Patched versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the WHATWG URL specification, including web browsers and Node's built-in URL class. Version 1.19.4 is patched against all known payload variants. Version 1.19.3 has a partial patch but is still vulnerable to a payload variant.]", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26291", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nUri.js Project\u00bbUri.jsVersions  before (<) 1.19.4cpe:2.3:a:uri.js_project:uri.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/commit/b02bf037c99ac9316b77ff8bfd840e90becf1155", "ref_desc": "fix(parse): treat backslash as forwardslash in authority (#403) \u00b7 medialize/URI.js@b02bf03 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/security/advisories/GHSA-3329-pjwv-fjpg", "ref_desc": "Hostname spoofing via backslashes in URL \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 medialize/URI.js \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/releases/tag/v1.19.4", "ref_desc": "Release 1.19.4 (December 23rd 2020) \u00b7 medialize/URI.js \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/urijs", "ref_desc": "urijs - npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
