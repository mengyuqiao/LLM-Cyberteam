{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26281", "Description": "async-h1 is an asynchronous HTTP/1.1 parser for Rust (crates.io). There is a request smuggling vulnerability in async-h1 before version 2.3.0. This vulnerability affects any webserver that uses async-h1 behind a reverse proxy, including all such Tide applications. If the server does not read the body of a request which is longer than some buffer length, async-h1 will attempt to read a subsequent request from the body content starting at that offset into the body. One way to exploit this vulnerability would be for an adversary to craft a request such that the body contains a request that would not be noticed by a reverse proxy, allowing it to forge forwarded/x-forwarded headers. If an application trusted the authenticity of these headers, it could be misled by the smuggled request. Another potential concern with this vulnerability is that if a reverse proxy is sending multiple http clients' requests along the same keep-alive connection, it would be possible for the smuggled request to specify a long content and capture another user's request in its body. This content could be captured in a post request to an endpoint that allows the content to be subsequently retrieved by the adversary. This has been addressed in async-h1 2.3.0 and previous versions have been yanked.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26281", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRust-lang\u00bbAsync-h1\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:rust-lang:async-h1:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-06  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/http-rs/async-h1/releases/tag/v2.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.3.0 \u00b7 http-rs/async-h1 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/http-rs/async-h1/security/advisories/GHSA-4vr9-8cjf-vf9c", "ref_desc": "Async-h1 request smuggling possible with long unread bodies \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 http-rs/async-h1 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
