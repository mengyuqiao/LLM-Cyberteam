{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26260", "Description": "BookStack is a platform for storing and organising information and documentation. In BookStack before version 0.30.5, a user with permissions to edit a page could set certain image URL's to manipulate functionality in the exporting system, which would allow them to make server side requests and/or have access to a wider scope of files within the BookStack file storage locations. The issue was addressed in BookStack v0.30.5. As a workaround, page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26260", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBookstackapp\u00bbBookstackVersions  before (<) 0.30.5cpe:2.3:a:bookstackapp:bookstack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bookstackapp.com/blog/beta-release-v0-30-5/", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-8wfc-w2r5-x7cr", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.30.5", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
