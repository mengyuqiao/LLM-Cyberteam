{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27755", "Description": "in SetImageExtent() of /MagickCore/image.c, an incorrect image depth size can cause a memory leak because the code which checks for the proper image depth size does not reset the size in the event there is an invalid size. The patch resets the depth to a proper size before throwing an exception. The memory leak can be triggered by a crafted input file that is processed by ImageMagick and could cause an impact to application reliability, such as denial of service. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27755", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nImagemagick\u00bbImagemagickVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0-0andbefore (<) 7.0.9-0cpe:2.3:a:imagemagick:imagemagick:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nImagemagick\u00bbImagemagickVersions  before (<) 6.9.10-69cpe:2.3:a:imagemagick:imagemagick:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-08-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894232", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
