{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28912", "Description": "With MariaDB running on Windows, when local clients connect to the server over named pipes, it's possible for an unprivileged user with an ability to run code on the server machine to intercept the named pipe connection and act as a man-in-the-middle, gaining access to all the data passed between the client and the server, and getting the ability to run SQL commands on behalf of the connected user. This occurs because of an incorrect security descriptor. This affects MariaDB Server before 10.1.48, 10.2.x before 10.2.35, 10.3.x before 10.3.26, 10.4.x before 10.4.16, and 10.5.x before 10.5.7. NOTE: this issue exists because certain details of the MariaDB CVE-2019-2503 fix did not comprehensively address attack variants against MariaDB. This situation is specific to MariaDB, and thus CVE-2020-28912 does NOT apply to other vendors that were originally affected by CVE-2019-2503.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28912", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMariadb\u00bbMariadbVersions  from including (>=) 10.2.0andbefore (<) 10.2.35cpe:2.3:a:mariadb:mariadb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMariadb\u00bbMariadbVersions  from including (>=) 10.4.0andbefore (<) 10.4.16cpe:2.3:a:mariadb:mariadb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMariadb\u00bbMariadbVersions  from including (>=) 10.5.0andbefore (<) 10.5.7cpe:2.3:a:mariadb:mariadb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMariadb\u00bbMariadbVersions  before (<) 10.1.48cpe:2.3:a:mariadb:mariadb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMariadb\u00bbMariadbVersions  from including (>=) 10.3.0andbefore (<) 10.3.26cpe:2.3:a:mariadb:mariadb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-24040", "ref_desc": "[MDEV-24040] Named pipe permission issue - JiraIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1019891", "ref_desc": "#1019891 Named pipe connection inteceptionThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
