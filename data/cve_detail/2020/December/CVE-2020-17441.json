{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17441", "Description": "An issue was discovered in picoTCP 1.7.0. The code for processing the IPv6 headers does not validate whether the IPv6 payload length field is equal to the actual size of the payload, which leads to an Out-of-Bounds read during the ICMPv6 checksum calculation, resulting in either Denial-of-Service or Information Disclosure. This affects pico_ipv6_extension_headers and pico_checksum_adder (in pico_ipv6.c and pico_frame.c).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17441", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMicrochip\u00bbMplab HarmonyVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.7.0cpe:2.3:a:microchip:mplab_harmony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAltran\u00bbPicotcpVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:altran:picotcp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-27  0.25%  0.28%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-07-18  0.25%  0.25%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.25%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815128", "ref_desc": "VU#815128 - Embedded TCP/IP stacks have memory corruption vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-FUlxT2jz69AbCp7LSKOixlsgNQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-343-01", "ref_desc": "Multiple Embedded TCP/IP Stacks | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GksSr3Ut2DFDp7UMd6qt_iwyAl8.html"}]}
