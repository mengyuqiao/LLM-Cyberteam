{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26257", "Description": "Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. Synapse is a reference \"homeserver\" implementation of Matrix. A malicious or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room by specifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This can lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be correctly sent to other servers over federation. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. The Matrix Synapse reference implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementation is vulnerable to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1. As a workaround homeserver administrators could limit access to the federation API to trusted servers (for example via `federation_domain_whitelist`).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26257", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.23.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-30  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.18%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.18%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/CHANGES.md#synapse-1231-2020-12-09", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-hxmp-pqch-c8mm", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DBTIU3ZNBFWZ56V4X7JIAD33V5H2GOMC/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: matrix-synapse-1.24.0-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/3ce2f303f15f6ac3dc352298972dc6e04d9b7a8b", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8776", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QR4MMYZKX5N5GYGH4H5LBUUC5TLAFHI7/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: matrix-synapse-1.24.0-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
