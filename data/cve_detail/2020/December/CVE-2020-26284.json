{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26284", "Description": "Hugo is a fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built in Go. Hugo depends on Go's `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents if these binaries are found in the system `%PATH%` on Windows. In Hugo before version 0.79.1, if a malicious file with the same name (`exe` or `bat`) is found in the current working directory at the time of running `hugo`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one. Windows users who run `hugo` inside untrusted Hugo sites are affected. Users should upgrade to Hugo v0.79.1. Other than avoiding untrusted Hugo sites, there is no workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26284", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGohugo\u00bbHugo\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 0.79.1cpe:2.3:a:gohugo:hugo:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.94% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.94%  +0.71 \n 2  2024-07-18  0.23%  0.23%  0.00 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.27%  0.23%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-12-10  0.19%  0.27%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-11-13  0.19%  0.19%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38736", "ref_desc": "proposal: os/exec: make LookPath not look in dot implicitly on Windows \u00b7 Issue #38736 \u00b7 golang/go \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/security/advisories/GHSA-8j34-9876-pvfq", "ref_desc": "Hugo can execute a binary from the current directory on Windows \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gohugoio/hugo \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
