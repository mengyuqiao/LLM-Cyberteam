{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25663", "Description": "A call to ConformPixelInfo() in the SetImageAlphaChannel() routine of /MagickCore/channel.c caused a subsequent heap-use-after-free or heap-buffer-overflow READ when GetPixelRed() or GetPixelBlue() was called. This could occur if an attacker is able to submit a malicious image file to be processed by ImageMagick and could lead to denial of service. It likely would not lead to anything further because the memory is used as pixel data and not e.g. a function pointer. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25663", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nImagemagick\u00bbImagemagickVersions  before (<) 7.0.8-56cpe:2.3:a:imagemagick:imagemagick:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-08-24  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-15  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1723#issuecomment-718275153", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1891601", "ref_desc": "Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1723", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
