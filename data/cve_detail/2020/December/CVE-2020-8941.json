{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8941", "Description": "An arbitrary memory read vulnerability in Asylo versions up to 0.6.0 allows an untrusted attacker to make a call to enc_untrusted_inet_pton using an attacker controlled klinux_addr_buffer parameter. The parameter size is unchecked allowing the attacker to read memory locations outside of the intended buffer size including memory addresses within the secure enclave.
