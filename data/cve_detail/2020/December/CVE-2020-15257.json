{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15257", "Description": "containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim\u2019s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \"host\" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15257", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbContainerdVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.4.3cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbContainerdVersions  before (<) 1.3.9cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  2.01%  0.05%  -1.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-669 Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/669/Incorrect-Resource-Transfer-Between-Spheres.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/4a4bb851f5da563ff6e68a83dc837c7699c469ad", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4 \u00b7 containerd/containerd@4a4bb85 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-33", "ref_desc": "containerd: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202105-33) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dVT9YHqxsESELbk65lR_TWQY58M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LNKXLOLZWO5FMAPX63ZL7JNKTNNT5NQD/", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.3", "ref_desc": "Release containerd 1.4.3 \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-36xw-fx78-c5r4", "ref_desc": "containerd-shim API exposed to host network containers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4865", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4865-1 docker.ioThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/X9rT6iN84Yd-lUybLAVtFzuvsxc.html"}]}
