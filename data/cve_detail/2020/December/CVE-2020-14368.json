{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14368", "Description": "A flaw was found in Eclipse Che in versions prior to 7.14.0 that impacts CodeReady Workspaces. When configured with cookies authentication, Theia IDE doesn't properly set the SameSite value, allowing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and consequently allowing a cross-site WebSocket hijack on Theia IDE. This flaw allows an attacker to gain full access to the victim's workspace through the /services endpoint. To perform a successful attack, the attacker conducts a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) and tricks the victim into executing a request via an untrusted link, which performs the CSRF and the Socket hijack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14368", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbCHEVersions  before (<) 7.14.0cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:che:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  5.25%  0.06%  -5.19 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1823892", "ref_desc": "1823892 \u2013 (CVE-2020-14368) CVE-2020-14368 eclipse che: cross-site websocket hijack of service endpointIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
