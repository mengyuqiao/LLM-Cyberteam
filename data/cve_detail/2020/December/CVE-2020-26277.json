{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26277", "Description": "DBdeployer is a tool that deploys MySQL database servers easily. In DBdeployer before version 1.58.2, users unpacking a tarball may use a maliciously packaged tarball that contains symlinks to files external to the target. In such scenario, an attacker could induce dbdeployer to write into a system file, thus altering the computer defenses. For the attack to succeed, the following factors need to contribute: 1) The user is logged in as root. While dbdeployer is usable as root, it was designed to run as unprivileged user. 2) The user has taken a tarball from a non secure source, without testing the checksum. When the tarball is retrieved through dbdeployer, the checksum is compared before attempting to unpack. This has been fixed in version 1.58.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26277", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDbdeployer\u00bbDbdeployerVersions  before (<) 1.58.2cpe:2.3:a:dbdeployer:dbdeployer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-06  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer/commit/548e256c1de2f99746e861454e7714ec6bc9bb10", "ref_desc": "Prevent arbitrary symlinks from tarballs \u00b7 datacharmer/dbdeployer@548e256 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer/security/advisories/GHSA-47wr-426j-fr82", "ref_desc": "Symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 datacharmer/dbdeployer \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
