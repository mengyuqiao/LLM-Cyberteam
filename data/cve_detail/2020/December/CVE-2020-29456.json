{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-29456", "Description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Papermerge before 1.5.2 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the rename, tag, upload, or create folder function. The payload can be in a folder, a tag, or a document's filename. If email consumption is configured in Papermerge, a malicious document can be sent by email and is automatically uploaded into the Papermerge web application. Therefore, no authentication is required to exploit XSS if email consumption is configured. Otherwise authentication is required.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29456", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPapermerge\u00bbPapermergeVersions  before (<) 1.5.2cpe:2.3:a:papermerge:papermerge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.10%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-10-06  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-08-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-09  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.10%  -1.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ciur/papermerge/releases/tag/v1.5.2", "ref_desc": "Release Version 1.5.2 \u00b7 ciur/papermerge \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.papermerge.com/", "ref_desc": "Open Source - Papermerge - Document Management SystemProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ciur/papermerge/issues/228", "ref_desc": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) \u00b7 Issue #228 \u00b7 ciur/papermerge \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
