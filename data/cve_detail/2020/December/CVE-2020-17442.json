{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17442", "Description": "An issue was discovered in picoTCP 1.7.0. The code for parsing the hop-by-hop IPv6 extension headers does not validate the bounds of the extension header length value, which may result in Integer Wraparound. Therefore, a crafted extension header length value may cause Denial-of-Service because it affects the loop in which the extension headers are parsed in pico_ipv6_process_hopbyhop() in pico_ipv6.c.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17442", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nAltran\u00bbPicotcpVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:altran:picotcp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-08-27  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-07-18  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815128", "ref_desc": "VU#815128 - Embedded TCP/IP stacks have memory corruption vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-FUlxT2jz69AbCp7LSKOixlsgNQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-343-01", "ref_desc": "Multiple Embedded TCP/IP Stacks | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GksSr3Ut2DFDp7UMd6qt_iwyAl8.html"}]}
