{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15023", "Description": "Askey AP5100W devices through AP5100W_Dual_SIG_1.01.097 are affected by WPS PIN offline brute-force cracking. This arises because of issues with the random number selection for the Diffie-Hellman exchange. By capturing an attempted (and even failed) WPS authentication attempt, it is possible to brute force the overall authentication exchange. This allows an attacker to obtain the recovered WPS PIN in minutes or even seconds, and eventually obtain the Wi-Fi PSK key, gaining access to the Wi=Fi network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15023", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAskey\u00bbAp5100w FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.01.097cpe:2.3:o:askey:ap5100w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Askey\u00bbAp5100w\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.45%  +0.17 \n 2  2024-04-15  0.26%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-03  0.27%  0.26%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-08-27  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-07-18  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.20%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.askey.com.tw/Products/wifi.html", "ref_desc": "AskeyProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.askey.com.tw/incident_report_notifications.html", "ref_desc": "AskeyVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/p4PKoawsI2ytCmwgwd-f5eKSNvo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://medium.com/csg-govtech/bolstering-security-how-i-breached-a-wifi-mesh-access-point-from-close-proximity-to-uncover-f8f77dc3cd5d", "ref_desc": "Bolstering security: How I breached a WiFi Mesh access point from close proximity to uncover vulnerabilities | by Keith Tay | CSG @ GovTech | Dec, 2020 | MediumExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QZu1ALufA1WerdR14zR69wrwklE.html"}]}
