{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11093", "Description": "Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11093", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbIndy-nodeVersions  before (<) 1.12.4cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:indy-node:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.25%  +0.07 \n 2  2023-09-09  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-31  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-18  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.11%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/auth_rules.md", "ref_desc": "indy-node/auth_rules.md at master \u00b7 hyperledger/indy-node \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1124", "ref_desc": "indy-node/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 hyperledger/indy-node \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/security/advisories/GHSA-wh2w-39f4-rpv2", "ref_desc": "Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hyperledger/indy-node \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/commit/55056f22c83b7c3520488b615e1577e0f895d75a", "ref_desc": "changed auth rules check to skip those without verkey and role \u00b7 hyperledger/indy-node@55056f2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
