{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26255", "Description": "Kirby is a CMS. In Kirby CMS (getkirby/cms) before version 3.4.5, and Kirby Panel before version 2.5.14 , an editor with full access to the Kirby Panel can upload a PHP .phar file and execute it on the server. This vulnerability is critical if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users, as they can gain access to the server with such a Phar file. Visitors without Panel access *cannot* use this attack vector. The problem has been patched in Kirby 2.5.14 and Kirby 3.4.5. Please update to one of these or a later version to fix the vulnerability. Note: Kirby 2 reaches end of life on December 31, 2020. We therefore recommend to upgrade your Kirby 2 sites to Kirby 3. If you cannot upgrade, we still recommend to update to Kirby 2.5.14.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26255", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  before (<) 3.4.5cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbPanelVersions  before (<) 2.5.14cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:panel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-27  0.18%  0.23%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.18%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.4.5", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/getkirby/cms", "ref_desc": "Product;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/aE4qrjuv6z3P5mFB2WvmLkAitK8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby-v2/panel/commit/5a569d4e3ddaea2b6628d7ec1472a3e8bc410881", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/db8f371b13036861c9cc5ba3e85e27f73fce5e09", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-g3h8-cg9x-47qw", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/getkirby/panel", "ref_desc": "Product;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Zn1TLG0KaT5vYDhDtongnRiQvIw.html"}]}
