{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25095", "Description": "LogRhythm Platform Manager (PM) 7.4.9 allows CSRF. The Web interface is vulnerable to Cross-site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH). If a logged-in PM user visits a malicious site in the same browser session, that site can perform a CSRF attack to create a WebSocket from the victim client to the vulnerable PM server. Once the socket is created, the malicious site can interact with the vulnerable web server in the context of the logged-in user. This can include WebSocket payloads that result in command execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25095", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nLogrhythm\u00bbPlatform Manager\u00bbVersion:7.4.9cpe:2.3:a:logrhythm:platform_manager:7.4.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-09-01  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-07-23  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.11%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cybercx.com.au/blog/2020/12/15/logrhythm-zero-days/", "ref_desc": "LogRhythm Zero Days | CyberCXThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZHPnuzLftQJshYFCKhSHel7ZdsY.html"}]}
