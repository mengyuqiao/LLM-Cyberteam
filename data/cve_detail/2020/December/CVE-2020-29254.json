{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-29254", "Description": "TikiWiki 21.2 allows templates to be edited without CSRF protection. This could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user. These action include allowing attackers to submit their own code through an authenticated user resulting in local file Inclusion. If an authenticated user who is able to edit TikiWiki templates visits an malicious website, template code can be edited.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29254", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nTiki\u00bbTikiwiki Cms/groupware\u00bbVersion:21.2cpe:2.3:a:tiki:tikiwiki_cms\\/groupware:21.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.68% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.44%  0.68%  +0.25 \n 2  2024-08-28  0.37%  0.44%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-07-25  0.30%  0.37%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-08-27  0.31%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-07-18  0.32%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  7.38%  0.32%  -7.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/S1lkys/CVE-2020-29254/blob/main/Tiki-Wiki%2021.2%20by%20Maximilian%20Barz.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-29254/Tiki-Wiki 21.2 by Maximilian Barz.pdf at main \u00b7 S1lkys/CVE-2020-29254 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://youtu.be/Uc3sRBitu50", "ref_desc": "TikiWiki 21.2 - Edit Template CSRF - CVE-2020-29254 - YouTubeExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/S1lkys/CVE-2020-29254", "ref_desc": "GitHub - S1lkys/CVE-2020-29254: TikiWiki 21.2 allows to edit templates without the use of a CSRF protection.Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
