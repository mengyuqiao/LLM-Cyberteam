{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35702", "Description": "DCTStream::getChars in DCTStream.cc in Poppler 20.12.1 has a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted PDF document. NOTE: later reports indicate that this only affects builds from Poppler git clones in late December 2020, not the 20.12.1 release. In this situation, it should NOT be considered a Poppler vulnerability. However, several third-party Open Source projects directly rely on Poppler git clones made at arbitrary times, and therefore the CVE remains useful to users of those projects", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35702", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nFreedesktop\u00bbPoppler\u00bbVersion:20.12.1cpe:2.3:a:freedesktop:poppler:20.12.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-07-31  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/issues/1011", "ref_desc": "Heap-Buffer-Overflow in DCTStream::getChars (#1011) \u00b7 Issues \u00b7 poppler / poppler \u00b7 GitLabExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
