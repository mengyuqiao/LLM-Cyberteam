{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17438", "Description": "An issue was discovered in uIP 1.0, as used in Contiki 3.0 and other products. The code that reassembles fragmented packets fails to properly validate the total length of an incoming packet specified in its IP header, as well as the fragmentation offset value specified in the IP header. By crafting a packet with specific values of the IP header length and the fragmentation offset, attackers can write into the .bss section of the program (past the statically allocated buffer that is used for storing the fragmented data) and cause a denial of service in uip_reass() in uip.c, or possibly execute arbitrary code on some target architectures.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17438", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nUip Project\u00bbUIP\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:uip_project:uip:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Contiki-os\u00bbContiki\u00bbVersion:3.0", "EPSS Score": "0.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-15  0.34%  0.48%  +0.14 \n 2  2023-11-17  0.32%  0.34%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-08-27  0.36%  0.32%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-07-18  0.38%  0.36%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.38%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815128", "ref_desc": "VU#815128 - Embedded TCP/IP stacks have memory corruption vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-FUlxT2jz69AbCp7LSKOixlsgNQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-343-01", "ref_desc": "Multiple Embedded TCP/IP Stacks | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GksSr3Ut2DFDp7UMd6qt_iwyAl8.html"}]}
