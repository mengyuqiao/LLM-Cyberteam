{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-29566", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When they require assistance from the device model, x86 HVM guests must be temporarily de-scheduled. The device model will signal Xen when it has completed its operation, via an event channel, so that the relevant vCPU is rescheduled. If the device model were to signal Xen without having actually completed the operation, the de-schedule / re-schedule cycle would repeat. If, in addition, Xen is resignalled very quickly, the re-schedule may occur before the de-schedule was fully complete, triggering a shortcut. This potentially repeating process uses ordinary recursive function calls, and thus could result in a stack overflow. A malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest can cause Xen to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the entire host. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 stubdomains serving HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29566", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXEN\u00bbXEN\u00bbForX86Versions  up to, including, (<=) 4.14.0cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OBLV6L6Q24PPQ2CRFXDX4Q76KU776GKI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: xen-4.14.0-14.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jMfq1daDux87C1e21A2DTy2xfIA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2C6M6S3CIMEBACH6O7V4H2VDANMO6TVA/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: xen-4.13.2-5.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Kow5dw4mazMWjnPS-yvMVpOH-cM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4812", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4812-1 xenThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Mn4xZwpQozs_oW4SDk-b6YfVrEw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-348.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-348 - Xen Security AdvisoriesPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-30", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202107-30) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UOh9rWWorJz0YZeHveEaWWYNUBI.html"}]}
