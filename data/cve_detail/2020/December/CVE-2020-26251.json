{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26251", "Description": "Open Zaak is a modern, open-source data- and services-layer to enable zaakgericht werken, a Dutch approach to case management. In Open Zaak before version 1.3.3 the Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing policy in Open Zaak is currently wide open - every client is allowed. This allows evil.com to run scripts that perform AJAX calls to known Open Zaak installations, and the browser will not block these. This was intended to only apply to development machines running on localhost/127.0.0.1. Open Zaak 1.3.3 disables CORS by default, while it can be opted-in through environment variables. The vulnerability does not actually seem exploitable because: a) The session cookie has a `Same-Site: Lax` policy which prevents it from being sent along in Cross-Origin requests. b) All pages that give access to (production) data are login-protected c) `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `false` d) CSRF checks probably block the remote origin, since they're not explicitly added to the trusted allowlist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26251", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzaak\u00bbOpen ZaakVersions  before (<) 1.3.3cpe:2.3:a:openzaak:open_zaak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.10%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2024-10-07  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-03  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-25  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-06-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#133-2020-12-17", "ref_desc": "open-zaak/CHANGELOG.rst at master \u00b7 open-zaak/open-zaak \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/security/advisories/GHSA-chhr-gxrg-64x7", "ref_desc": "CORS configuration is possibly vulnerable \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-zaak/open-zaak \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/commit/952269269f1b629fce9c94485f83ac13f31d6c46", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-chhr-gxrg-64x7 \u00b7 open-zaak/open-zaak@9522692 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
