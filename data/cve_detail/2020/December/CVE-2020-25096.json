{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25096", "Description": "LogRhythm Platform Manager (PM) 7.4.9 has Incorrect Access Control. Users within LogRhythm can be delegated different roles and privileges, intended to limit what data and services they can interact with. However, no access control is enforced for WebSocket-based communication to the PM application server, which will forward requests to any configured back-end server, regardless of whether the user's access rights should permit this. As a result, even the most low-privileged user can interact with any back-end component that has a LogRhythm agent installed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25096", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLogrhythm\u00bbPlatform Manager\u00bbVersion:7.4.9cpe:2.3:a:logrhythm:platform_manager:7.4.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cybercx.com.au/blog/2020/12/15/logrhythm-zero-days/", "ref_desc": "LogRhythm Zero Days | CyberCXThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZHPnuzLftQJshYFCKhSHel7ZdsY.html"}]}
