{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35677", "Description": "BigProf Online Invoicing System before 4.0 fails to adequately sanitize fields for HTML characters upon an administrator using admin/pageEditGroup.php to create a new group, resulting in Stored XSS. The caveat here is that an attacker would need administrative privileges in order to create the payload. One might think this completely mitigates the privilege-escalation impact as there is only one high-privileged role. However, it was discovered that the endpoint responsible for creating the group lacks CSRF protection.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35677", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nBigprof\u00bbOnline Invoicing SystemVersions  before (<) 4.0cpe:2.3:a:bigprof:online_invoicing_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://labs.ingredous.com/2020/07/13/ois-groupedit-xss/", "ref_desc": "BigProf-Software Online Invoicing System | Stored XSS via CSRF in /admin/pageEditGroup.php -> Application Takeover - Ingredous LabsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
