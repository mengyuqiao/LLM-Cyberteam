{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35693", "Description": "On some Samsung phones and tablets running Android through 7.1.1, it is possible for an attacker-controlled Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device to pair silently with a vulnerable target device, without any user interaction, when the target device's Bluetooth is on, and it is running an app that offers a connectable BLE advertisement. An example of such an app could be a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app, such as Australia's COVIDSafe app, Singapore's TraceTogether app, or France's TousAntiCovid (formerly StopCovid). As part of the pairing process, two pieces (among others) of personally identifiable information are exchanged: the Identity Address of the Bluetooth adapter of the target device, and its associated Identity Resolving Key (IRK). Either one of these identifiers can be used to perform re-identification of the target device for long term tracking. The list of affected devices includes (but is not limited to): Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy A3, Tab A (2017), J2 Pro (2018), Galaxy Note 4, and Galaxy S5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35693", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.1.1cpe:2.3:o:google:android:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbGalaxy A3\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbGalaxy Note 4\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbGalaxy Note 5\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbGalaxy S5\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbGalaxy S6 Edge\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbJ2 Pro (2018)\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbTab A (2017)\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-04-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-31  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/alwentiu/contact-tracing-research/blob/main/samsung.pdf", "ref_desc": "contact-tracing-research/samsung.pdf at main \u00b7 alwentiu/contact-tracing-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
