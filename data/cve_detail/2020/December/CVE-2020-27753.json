{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27753", "Description": "There are several memory leaks in the MIFF coder in /coders/miff.c due to improper image depth values, which can be triggered by a specially crafted input file. These leaks could potentially lead to an impact to application availability or cause a denial of service. It was originally reported that the issues were in `AcquireMagickMemory()` because that is where LeakSanitizer detected the leaks, but the patch resolves issues in the MIFF coder, which incorrectly handles data being passed to `AcquireMagickMemory()`. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27753", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nImagemagick\u00bbImagemagickVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0-0andbefore (<) 7.0.9-0cpe:2.3:a:imagemagick:imagemagick:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nImagemagick\u00bbImagemagickVersions  before (<) 6.9.10-69cpe:2.3:a:imagemagick:imagemagick:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-08-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894229", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
