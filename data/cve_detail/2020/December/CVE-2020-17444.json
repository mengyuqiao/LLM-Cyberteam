{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17444", "Description": "An issue was discovered in picoTCP 1.7.0. The routine for processing the next header field (and deducing whether the IPv6 extension headers are valid) doesn't check whether the header extension length field would overflow. Therefore, if it wraps around to zero, iterating through the extension headers will not increment the current data pointer. This leads to an infinite loop and Denial-of-Service in pico_ipv6_check_headers_sequence() in pico_ipv6.c.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17444", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nAltran\u00bbPicotcpVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:altran:picotcp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.18%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-04-30  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-08-27  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-18  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815128", "ref_desc": "VU#815128 - Embedded TCP/IP stacks have memory corruption vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-FUlxT2jz69AbCp7LSKOixlsgNQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-343-01", "ref_desc": "Multiple Embedded TCP/IP Stacks | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GksSr3Ut2DFDp7UMd6qt_iwyAl8.html"}]}
