{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25507", "Description": "An incorrect permission assignment during the installation script of TeamworkCloud 18.0 thru 19.0 allows a local unprivileged attacker to execute arbitrary code as root. During installation, the user is instructed to set the system enviroment file with world writable permissions (0777 /etc/environment). Any local unprivileged user can execute arbitrary code simply by writing to /etc/environment, which will force all users, including root, to execute arbitrary code during the next login or reboot. In addition, the entire home directory of the twcloud user at /home/twcloud is recursively given world writable permissions. This allows any local unprivileged attacker to execute arbitrary code, as twcloud. This product was previous named Cameo Enterprise Data Warehouse (CEDW).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25507", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\n3DS\u00bbTeamwork CloudVersions  from including (>=) 18.0andup to, including, (<=) 19.0cpe:2.3:a:3ds:teamwork_cloud:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-02  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-22  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.51%  0.13%  -1.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sick.codes/sick-2020-002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-25507 - NoMagic (Dassault Syst\u00e8mes 3DS) Teamwork Cloud 18.0-19.0 - Incorrect Permissions Assignment for a Critical Resource Allows Arbitrary Code Execution and Local Privilege Escalation to R", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sick.codes/finding-a-vulnerability-in-teamwork-cloud-server-nomagic-3ds-which-is-used-by-gov-enterprise-to-design-rockets-missiles-and-satellites", "ref_desc": "Finding a Vulnerability in Teamwork Cloud Server (NoMagic, 3DS), Which Is Used By Gov/Enterprise to Design Rockets, Missiles, and Satellites. - Sick Codes - Linux, NetSec, VPS, Arch, Debian, CentOS Tw", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.nomagic.com/display/TWCloud190/Installation+on+Linux+using+scripts", "ref_desc": "Installation on Linux using scriptsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://community.nomagic.com/finding-and-fixing-wrong-file-permission-twc-installation-t7165.html", "ref_desc": "No Magic Community Forum \u2022 View topic - Finding and fixing wrong file permission - TWC installation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sickcodes/security/blob/master/advisories/SICK-2020-002.md", "ref_desc": "security/SICK-2020-002.md at master \u00b7 sickcodes/security \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219155833/https://docs.nomagic.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20846937", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219095507/https://docs.nomagic.com/display/TWCloud185SP1/Installation+on+Centos+7.", "ref_desc": "Wayback Machine", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
