{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26287", "Description": "HedgeDoc is a collaborative platform for writing and sharing markdown. In HedgeDoc before version 1.7.1 an attacker can inject arbitrary `script` tags in HedgeDoc notes using mermaid diagrams. Our content security policy prevents loading scripts from most locations, but `www.google-analytics.com` is allowed. Using Google Tag Manger it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript and execute it on page load. Depending on the configuration of the instance, the attacker may not need authentication to create or edit notes. The problem is patched in HedgeDoc 1.7.1. As a workaround one can disallow `www.google-analytics.com` in the `Content-Security-Policy` header. Note that other ways to leverage the `script` tag injection might exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26287", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nHedgedoc\u00bbHedgedocVersions  before (<) 1.7.1cpe:2.3:a:hedgedoc:hedgedoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.46%  0.40%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-01-31  0.32%  0.46%  +0.14 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.32%  -0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/releases/tag/1.7.1", "ref_desc": "Release HedgeDoc 1.7.1 \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3u-VTlLAfzFgnRaaPrKj6dhFTlQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-g6w6-7xf9-m95p", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in mermaid diagrams \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Alemmi/ctf-writeups/blob/main/hxpctf-2020/hackme/solution.md", "ref_desc": "ctf-writeups/solution.md at main \u00b7 Alemmi/ctf-writeups \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/58276ebbf4504a682454a3686dcaff88bc1069d4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-g6w6-7xf9-m95p \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc@58276eb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/issues/1630", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in mermaid \u00b7 Issue #1630 \u00b7 hackmdio/codimd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
