{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26276", "Description": "Fleet is an open source osquery manager. In Fleet before version 3.5.1, due to issues in Go's standard library XML parsing, a valid SAML response may be mutated by an attacker to modify the trusted document. This can result in allowing unverified logins from a SAML IdP. Users that configure Fleet with SSO login may be vulnerable to this issue. This issue is patched in 3.5.1. The fix was made using https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator If upgrade to 3.5.1 is not possible, users should disable SSO authentication in Fleet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26276", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFleetdm\u00bbFleetVersions  before (<) 3.5.1cpe:2.3:a:fleetdm:fleet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.59%  0.56%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.43%  0.59%  +0.16 \n 3  2024-10-06  0.36%  0.43%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-09-02  0.33%  0.36%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-07-24  0.32%  0.33%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-28  0.31%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.31%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mattermost.com/blog/coordinated-disclosure-go-xml-vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "Coordinated disclosure of XML round-trip vulnerabilities in Go libraryNot Applicable;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-w3wf-cfx3-6gcx", "ref_desc": "SAML authentication vulnerability due to stdlib XML parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fleetdm/fleet \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/commit/57812a532e5f749c8e18c6f6a652eca65c083607", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-w3wf-cfx3-6gcx \u00b7 fleetdm/fleet@57812a5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#fleet-351-dec-14-2020", "ref_desc": "fleet/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 fleetdm/fleet \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator", "ref_desc": "GitHub - mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validatorThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
