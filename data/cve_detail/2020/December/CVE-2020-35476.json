{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35476", "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability occurs in OpenTSDB through 2.4.0 via command injection in the yrange parameter. The yrange value is written to a gnuplot file in the /tmp directory. This file is then executed via the mygnuplot.sh shell script. (tsd/GraphHandler.java attempted to prevent command injections by blocking backticks but this is insufficient.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35476", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpentsdb\u00bbOpentsdbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:opentsdb:opentsdb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  95.93%  96.64%  +0.70 \n 2  2024-11-22  95.25%  95.93%  +0.69 \n 3  2024-11-06  95.18%  95.25%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-10-05  95.25%  95.18%  -0.06 \n 5  2024-09-17  95.35%  95.25%  -0.11 \n 6  2024-09-02  95.59%  95.35%  -0.24 \n 7  2024-08-15  95.54%  95.59%  +0.05 \n 8  2024-07-30  95.95%  95.54%  -0.41 \n 9  2024-07-13  96.21%  95.95%  -0.27 \n 10  2024-05-21  95.88%  96.21%  +0.34 \n 11  2024-05-05  96.09%  95.88%  -0.22 \n 12  2024-04-20  95.90%  96.09%  +0.20 \n 13  2024-04-03  95.56%  95.90%  +0.34 \n 14  2024-03-04  95.34%  95.56%  +0.21 \n 15  2024-02-17  95.41%  95.34%  -0.07 \n 16  2024-02-02  95.74%  95.41%  -0.33 \n 17  2023-12-05  96.02%  95.74%  -0.27 \n 18  2023-11-22  96.08%  96.02%  -0.06 \n 19  2023-09-27  96.15%  96.08%  -0.07 \n 20  2023-09-01  96.32%  96.15%  -0.18 \n 21  2023-07-23  96.30%  96.32%  +0.03 \n 22  2023-07-08  76.92%  96.30%  +19.38 \n 23  2023-06-27  72.82%  76.92%  +4.10 \n 24  2023-06-14  75.02%  72.82%  -2.20 \n 25  2023-05-31  74.50%  75.02%  +0.52 \n 26  2023-05-08  78.49%  74.50%  -3.99 \n 27  2023-04-07  68.19%  78.49%  +10.30 \n 28  2023-03-22  62.35%  68.19%  +5.84 \n 29  2023-03-07  87.65%  62.35%  -25.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170331/OpenTSDB-2.4.0-Command-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "OpenTSDB 2.4.0 Command Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/issues/2051", "ref_desc": "OpenTSDB 2.4.0 Remote Code Execution \u00b7 Issue #2051 \u00b7 OpenTSDB/opentsdb \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
