{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26275", "Description": "The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter notebook, JupyterLab, and Voila. In Jupyter Server before version 1.1.1, an open redirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter server to redirect the browser to a different malicious website. All jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8. This is fixed in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix: \"jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/\".", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26275", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbJupyter ServerVersions  before (<) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyter_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-09-06  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-28  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-15  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-server/", "ref_desc": "jupyter-server \u00b7 PyPIProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://advisory.checkmarx.net/advisory/CX-2020-4291", "ref_desc": "Checkmarx Advisory | CX-2020-4291 / Open redirect in Jupyter serverExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/85e4abccf6ea9321d29153f73b0bd72ccb3a6bca", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-9f66-54xg-pc2c \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server@85e4abc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-9f66-54xg-pc2c", "ref_desc": "Open redirect vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
