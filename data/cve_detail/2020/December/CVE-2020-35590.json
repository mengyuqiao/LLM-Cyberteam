{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35590", "Description": "LimitLoginAttempts.php in the limit-login-attempts-reloaded plugin before 2.17.4 for WordPress allows a bypass of (per IP address) rate limits because the X-Forwarded-For header can be forged. When the plugin is configured to accept an arbitrary header for the client source IP address, a malicious user is not limited to perform a brute force attack, because the client IP header accepts any arbitrary string. When randomizing the header input, the login count does not ever reach the maximum allowed retries.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35590", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLimitloginattempts\u00bbLimit Login Attempts Reloaded\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.17.4cpe:2.3:a:limitloginattempts:limit_login_attempts_reloaded:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-06  0.21%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  9.03%  0.21%  -8.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/wordpress-plugin-limit-login-attempts-reloaded/", "ref_desc": "WordPress Plugin Limit Login Attempts Reloaded - The Tales of N4nj0Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/beJhZ3TpOvmQ-WBuhSGfEgZDw0M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts-reloaded/#developers", "ref_desc": "Limit Login Attempts Reloaded \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.orgProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VYxZMJh6OvzzpHWcdMg6SlYQhhg.html"}]}
