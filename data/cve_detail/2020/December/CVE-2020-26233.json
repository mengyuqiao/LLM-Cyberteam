{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26233", "Description": "Git Credential Manager Core (GCM Core) is a secure Git credential helper built on .NET Core that runs on Windows and macOS. In Git Credential Manager Core before version 2.0.289, when recursively cloning a Git repository on Windows with submodules, Git will first clone the top-level repository and then recursively clone all submodules by starting new Git processes from the top-level working directory. If a malicious git.exe executable is present in the top-level repository then this binary will be started by Git Credential Manager Core when attempting to read configuration, and not git.exe as found on the %PATH%. This only affects GCM Core on Windows, not macOS or Linux-based distributions. GCM Core version 2.0.289 contains the fix for this vulnerability, and is available from the project's GitHub releases page. GCM Core 2.0.289 is also bundled in the latest Git for Windows release; version 2.29.2(3). As a workaround, users should avoid recursively cloning untrusted repositories with the --recurse-submodules option.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26233", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbGit Credential Manager Core\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 2.0.289cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:git_credential_manager_core:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.11%  -1.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/706/Use-of-Incorrectly-Resolved-Name-or-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.blazeinfosec.com/attack-of-the-clones-2-git-command-client-remote-code-execution-strikes-back/", "ref_desc": "Attack of the clones 2: Git CLI remote code execution strikes backExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core/commit/61c0388e064babb3b4e60d3ec269e8a07ab3bc76", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---recurse-submodulesltpathspecgt", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Gueo5j_Yt-p0s_tP4xpNXVum520.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core/releases/tag/v2.0.289-beta", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core/security/advisories/GHSA-2gq7-ww4j-3m76", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
