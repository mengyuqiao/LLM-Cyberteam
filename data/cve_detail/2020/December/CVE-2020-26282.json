{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26282", "Description": "BrowserUp Proxy allows you to manipulate HTTP requests and responses, capture HTTP content, and export performance data as a HAR file. BrowserUp Proxy works well as a standalone proxy server, but it is especially useful when embedded in Selenium tests. A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in BrowserUp Proxy enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. This has been patched in version 2.1.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26282", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nBrowserup\u00bbBrowserup ProxyVersions  before (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:browserup:browserup_proxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "6.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.63%  6.21%  +0.58 \n 2  2024-02-25  5.32%  5.63%  +0.31 \n 3  2023-12-13  4.17%  5.32%  +1.15 \n 4  2023-11-30  3.96%  4.17%  +0.21 \n 5  2023-11-16  2.83%  3.96%  +1.13 \n 6  2023-09-09  2.79%  2.83%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-07-31  2.09%  2.79%  +0.71 \n 8  2023-06-08  2.01%  2.09%  +0.07 \n 9  2023-03-18  1.57%  2.01%  +0.45 \n 10  2023-03-07  5.63%  1.57%  -4.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/releases/tag/v2.1.2", "ref_desc": "Release v2.1.2 \u00b7 browserup/browserup-proxy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/research/bean-validation-RCE", "ref_desc": "Bean Stalking: Growing Java beans into RCE - GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/commit/4b38e7a3e20917e5c3329d0d4e9590bed9d578ab", "ref_desc": "Fix Critical Java EL Injection RCE vulnerability from GHSL-2020-213 \u00b7 browserup/browserup-proxy@4b38e7a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-wmfg-55f9-j8hq", "ref_desc": "Server-Side Template Injection Vulnerability allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Java EL Expressions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 browserup/browserup-proxy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
