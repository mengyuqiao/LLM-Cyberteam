{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26259", "Description": "XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.15, is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion on the local host when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist running Java 15 or higher. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailed in the referenced advisories.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26259", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXstream Project\u00bbXstreamVersions  before (<) 1.4.15cpe:2.3:a:xstream_project:xstream:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "39.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  60.31%  39.97%  -20.34 \n 2  2024-11-22  57.55%  60.31%  +2.75 \n 3  2024-02-17  49.98%  57.55%  +7.57 \n 4  2023-11-08  61.73%  49.98%  -11.75 \n 5  2023-08-31  58.15%  61.73%  +3.58 \n 6  2023-07-22  58.61%  58.15%  -0.46 \n 7  2023-07-10  62.45%  58.61%  -3.85 \n 8  2023-03-07  26.13%  62.45%  +36.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-jfvx-7wrx-43fh", "ref_desc": "XStream is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion on the local host when unmarshalling \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 x-stream/xstream \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22KVR6B5IZP3BGQ3HPWIO2FWWCKT3DHP/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: xstream-1.4.18-2.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/19VF4b4I-5uRiSGzbcCBa1ZWMTE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r97993e3d78e1f5389b7b172ba9f308440830ce5f051ee62714a0aa34@%3Ccommits.struts.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[struts] branch master updated: Upgrades XStream to version 1.4.15 to address CVE-2020-26258, CVE-2020-26259 - Pony MailMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DdnEkgeupfXiqdcNDwlisWeg-Lw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210409-0005/", "ref_desc": "December 2020 XStream Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ftpRiSFbdAqC9MiW6et72IVq-2g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2020-26259.html", "ref_desc": "XStream - CVE-2020-26259Exploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/12/msg00042.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2507-1] libxstream-java security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kMxEIjesm5JOguqQHYjovbUptzs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGXIU3YDPG6OGTDHMBLAFN7BPBERXREB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: xstream-1.4.18-2.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/osmDFwsKvL8LqkEsC2V5SzRMusk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVPHZA7VW2RRSDCOIPP2W6O5ND254TU7/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: xstream-1.4.18-2.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RHyRl6e6h71UXFZzswq5dp-l-YI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4828", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4828-1 libxstream-javaThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wr8Jd9kcj0wEo7DgAiK4BDntHFY.html"}]}
