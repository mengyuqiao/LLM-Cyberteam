{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26244", "Description": "Python oic is a Python OpenID Connect implementation. In Python oic before version 1.2.1, there are several related cryptographic issues affecting client implementations that use the library. The issues are: 1) The IdToken signature algorithm was not checked automatically, but only if the expected algorithm was passed in as a kwarg. 2) JWA `none` algorithm was allowed in all flows. 3) oic.consumer.Consumer.parse_authz returns an unverified IdToken. The verification of the token was left to the discretion of the implementator. 4) iat claim was not checked for sanity (i.e. it could be in the future). These issues are patched in version 1.2.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26244", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPython Openid Connect Project\u00bbPython Openid ConnectVersions  before (<) 1.2.1cpe:2.3:a:python_openid_connect_project:python_openid_connect:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.10%  -0.06 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.16%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-325 Missing Cryptographic Step", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/325/Missing-Cryptographic-Step.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/pyoidc/security/advisories/GHSA-4fjv-pmhg-3rfg", "ref_desc": "Client vulnerabilites to replay attack and cipher downgrade \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenIDC/pyoidc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/pyoidc/releases/tag/1.2.1", "ref_desc": "Release Security vulnerability fix (CVE-2020-26244) \u00b7 OpenIDC/pyoidc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/oic/", "ref_desc": "oic \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/pyoidc/commit/62f8d753fa17c8b1f29f8be639cf0b33afb02498", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-4fjv-pmhg-3rfg \u00b7 OpenIDC/pyoidc@62f8d75 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
