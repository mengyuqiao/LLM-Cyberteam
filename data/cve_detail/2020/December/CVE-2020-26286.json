{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26286", "Description": "HedgeDoc is a collaborative platform for writing and sharing markdown. In HedgeDoc before version 1.7.1 an unauthenticated attacker can upload arbitrary files to the upload storage backend including HTML, JS and PHP files. The problem is patched in HedgeDoc 1.7.1. You should however verify that your uploaded file storage only contains files that are allowed, as uploaded files might still be served. As workaround it's possible to block the `/uploadimage` endpoint on your instance using your reverse proxy. And/or restrict MIME-types and file names served from your upload file storage.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26286", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHedgedoc\u00bbHedgedocVersions  before (<) 1.7.1cpe:2.3:a:hedgedoc:hedgedoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-10-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-08-04  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-07-09  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-wcr3-xhv7-8gxc", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary file upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/releases/tag/1.7.1", "ref_desc": "Release HedgeDoc 1.7.1 \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3u-VTlLAfzFgnRaaPrKj6dhFTlQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/e9306991cdb5ff2752c1eeba3fedba42aec3c2d8", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wcr3-xhv7-8gxc \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc@e930699 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
