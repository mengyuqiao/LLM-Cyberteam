{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17470", "Description": "An issue was discovered in FNET through 4.6.4. The code that initializes the DNS client interface structure does not set sufficiently random transaction IDs (they are always set to 1 in _fnet_dns_poll in fnet_dns.c). This significantly simplifies DNS cache poisoning attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17470", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nButok\u00bbFnetVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.6.4cpe:2.3:a:butok:fnet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-15  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2024-09-30  0.08%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-18  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-06-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815128", "ref_desc": "VU#815128 - Embedded TCP/IP stacks have memory corruption vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-FUlxT2jz69AbCp7LSKOixlsgNQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-343-01", "ref_desc": "Multiple Embedded TCP/IP Stacks | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GksSr3Ut2DFDp7UMd6qt_iwyAl8.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://fnet.sourceforge.net/manual/fnet_history.html", "ref_desc": "Embedded TCP/IP stack: FNET Change LogRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ivcD6yMmmFHkB5GL52wQ7Tv6Y4s.html"}]}
