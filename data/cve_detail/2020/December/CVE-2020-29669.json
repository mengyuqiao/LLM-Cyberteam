{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-29669", "Description": "In the Macally WIFISD2-2A82 Media and Travel Router 2.000.010, the Guest user is able to reset its own password. This process has a vulnerability which can be used to take over the administrator account and results in shell access. As the admin user may read the /etc/shadow file, the password hashes of each user (including root) can be dumped. The root hash can be cracked easily which results in a complete system compromise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29669", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMacally\u00bbWifisd2-2a82 Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.000.010cpe:2.3:o:macally:wifisd2-2a82_firmware:2.000.010:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Macally\u00bbWifisd2-2a82\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "11.98% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  8.18%  11.98%  +3.80 \n 2  2024-08-31  6.97%  8.18%  +1.21 \n 3  2024-05-19  5.16%  6.97%  +1.81 \n 4  2024-04-18  5.12%  5.16%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-01-16  3.72%  5.12%  +1.40 \n 6  2023-12-17  2.66%  3.72%  +1.06 \n 7  2023-11-05  2.72%  2.66%  -0.06 \n 8  2023-03-07  11.75%  2.72%  -9.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PpiRhhfph8U_0KAoIp0AnwY3mVtp-R-g/view", "ref_desc": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PpiRhhfph8U_0KAoIp0AnwY3mVtp-R-g/viewExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/S1lkys/CVE-2020-29669", "ref_desc": "GitHub - S1lkys/CVE-2020-29669: Macally WIFISD2Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160478/Macally-WIFISD2-2A82-2.000.010-Privilege-Escalation.html", "ref_desc": "Macally WIFISD2-2A82 2.000.010 Privilege Escalation \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
