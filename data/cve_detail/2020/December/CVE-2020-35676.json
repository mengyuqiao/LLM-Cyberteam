{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35676", "Description": "BigProf Online Invoicing System before 3.1 fails to correctly sanitize an XSS payload when a user registers using the self-registration functionality. As such, an attacker can input a crafted payload that will execute upon the application's administrator browsing the registered users' list. Once the arbitrary Javascript is executed in the context of the admin, this will cause the attacker to gain administrative privileges, effectively leading into an application takeover. This affects app/membership_signup.php and app/admin/pageViewMembers.php.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35676", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBigprof\u00bbOnline Invoicing SystemVersions  before (<) 3.1cpe:2.3:a:bigprof:online_invoicing_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.14%  +0.07 \n 2  2023-09-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-30  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://labs.ingredous.com/2020/07/13/ois-membershipsignup-xss/", "ref_desc": "BigProf-Software Online Invoicing System | Stored XSS in /membership_signup.php -> Application Takeover - Ingredous LabsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-invoicing-system/releases/tag/3.1", "ref_desc": "Release 3.1 \u00b7 bigprof-software/online-invoicing-system \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
