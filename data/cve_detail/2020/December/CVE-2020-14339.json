{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14339", "Description": "A flaw was found in libvirt, where it leaked a file descriptor for `/dev/mapper/control` into the QEMU process. This file descriptor allows for privileged operations to happen against the device-mapper on the host. This flaw allows a malicious guest user or process to perform operations outside of their standard permissions, potentially causing serious damage to the host operating system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14339", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0    Advanced VirtualizationEditioncpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8.0:*:*:*:advanced_virtualization:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbLibvirtVersions  from including (>=) 6.2.0andbefore (<) 6.7.0cpe:2.3:a:redhat:libvirt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/772/Missing-Release-of-Resource-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-06", "ref_desc": "libvirt: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202210-06) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-sIclYryKIfK_cmIl3Rh5k2cfak.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-22", "ref_desc": "libvirt: Unintended access to /dev/mapper/control (GLSA 202101-22) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860069", "ref_desc": "1860069 \u2013 (CVE-2020-14339) CVE-2020-14339 libvirt: leak of /dev/mapper/control into QEMU guestsIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
