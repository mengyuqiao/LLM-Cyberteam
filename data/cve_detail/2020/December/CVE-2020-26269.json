{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26269", "Description": "In TensorFlow release candidate versions 2.4.0rc*, the general implementation for matching filesystem paths to globbing pattern is vulnerable to an access out of bounds of the array holding the directories. There are multiple invariants and preconditions that are assumed by the parallel implementation of GetMatchingPaths but are not verified by the PRs introducing it (#40861 and #44310). Thus, we are completely rewriting the implementation to fully specify and validate these. This is patched in version 2.4.0. This issue only impacts master branch and the release candidates for TF version 2.4. The final release of the 2.4 release will be patched.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26269", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.4.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.4.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.4.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.4.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.4.0UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.4.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.4.0UpdateRC3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.4.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.4.0UpdateRC4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.4.0:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-07-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8b5b9dc96666a3a5d27fad7179ff215e3b74b67c", "ref_desc": "Completely rewrite `GetMatchingPaths`. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@8b5b9dc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9jjw-hf72-3mxw", "ref_desc": "Heap out of bounds read in filesystem glob matching \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
