{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26273", "Description": "osquery is a SQL powered operating system instrumentation, monitoring, and analytics framework. In osquery before version 4.6.0, by using sqlite's ATTACH verb, someone with administrative access to osquery can cause reads and writes to arbitrary sqlite databases on disk. This _does_ allow arbitrary files to be created, but they will be sqlite databases. It does not appear to allow existing non-sqlite files to be overwritten. This has been patched in osquery 4.6.0. There are several mitigating factors and possible workarounds. In some deployments, the people with access to these interfaces may be considered administrators. In some deployments, configuration is managed by a central tool. This tool can filter for the `ATTACH` keyword. osquery can be run as non-root user. Because this also limits the desired access levels, this requires deployment specific testing and configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26273", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbOsqueryVersions  before (<) 4.6.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:osquery:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-09  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/SQLite%20Injection.md#remote-command-execution-using-sqlite-command---load_extension", "ref_desc": "PayloadsAllTheThings/SQLite Injection.md at master \u00b7 swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osquery/osquery/releases/tag/4.6.0", "ref_desc": "Release 4.6.0 \u00b7 osquery/osquery \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osquery/osquery/commit/c3f9a3dae22d43ed3b4f6a403cbf89da4cba7c3c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-4g56-2482-x7q8 \u00b7 osquery/osquery@c3f9a3d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osquery/osquery/security/advisories/GHSA-4g56-2482-x7q8", "ref_desc": "sqlite ATTACH allows some filesystem access \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 osquery/osquery \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
