{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20225", "Description": "An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE: it has been reported that this is intended functionality and the user is responsible for using --extra-index-url securely", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20225", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPypa\u00bbPIPcpe:2.3:a:pypa:pip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.11%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1835736", "ref_desc": "1835736 \u2013 (CVE-2018-20225) CVE-2018-20225 python-pip: when --extra-index-url option is used and package does not already exist in the public index, the installation of malicious package with arbitrary", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cowlicks.website/posts/arbitrary-code-execution-from-pips-extra-index-url.html", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary code execution from pip's \"\u2014extra-index-url\" | cowlicksThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb1adce798445facd032870d644eb39c4baaf9c4a7dd5477d12bb6ab2%40%3Cgithub.arrow.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[GitHub] [arrow] BinduAggarwal opened a new pull request #7294: upgrading pip/wheel/setuptools-Apache Mail Archives", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb1adce798445facd032870d644eb39c4baaf9c4a7dd5477d12bb6ab2@%3Cgithub.arrow.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[GitHub] [arrow] BinduAggarwal opened a new pull request #7294: upgrading pip/wheel/setuptools - Pony Mail", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/", "ref_desc": "Changelog \u2014 pip 20.1 documentationRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
