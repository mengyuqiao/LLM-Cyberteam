{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11053", "Description": "In OAuth2 Proxy before 5.1.1, there is an open redirect vulnerability. Users can provide a redirect address for the proxy to send the authenticated user to at the end of the authentication flow. This is expected to be the original URL that the user was trying to access. This redirect URL is checked within the proxy and validated before redirecting the user to prevent malicious actors providing redirects to potentially harmful sites. However, by crafting a redirect URL with HTML encoded whitespace characters the validation could be bypassed and allow a redirect to any URL provided. This has been patched in 5.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11053", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nOauth2 Proxy Project\u00bbOauth2 ProxyVersions  before (<) 5.1.1cpe:2.3:a:oauth2_proxy_project:oauth2_proxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-j7px-6hwj-hpjg", "ref_desc": "Open Redirect Vulnerability with encoded Whitespace characters \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
