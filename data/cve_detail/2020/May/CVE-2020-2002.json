{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-2002", "Description": "An authentication bypass by spoofing vulnerability exists in the authentication daemon and User-ID components of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS by failing to verify the integrity of the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) before authenticating users. This affects all forms of authentication that use a Kerberos authentication profile. A man-in-the-middle type of attacker with the ability to intercept communication between PAN-OS and KDC can login to PAN-OS as an administrator. This issue affects: PAN-OS 7.1 versions earlier than 7.1.26; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.13; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.6; All version of PAN-OS 8.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2002", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.0.20cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.0.6cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 7.1.0andbefore (<) 7.1.26cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 8.1.0andbefore (<) 8.1.13cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2002", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-2002 PAN-OS: Spoofed Kerberos key distribution center authentication bypassVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
