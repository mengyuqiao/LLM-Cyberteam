{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18666", "Description": "An issue was discovered on D-Link DAP-1360 revision F devices. Remote attackers can start a telnet service without authorization via an undocumented HTTP request. Although this is the primary vulnerability, the impact depends on the firmware version. Versions 609EU through 613EUbeta were tested. Versions through 6.12b01 have weak root credentials, allowing an attacker to gain remote root access. After 6.12b01, the root credentials were changed but the telnet service can still be started without authorization.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18666", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDlink\u00bbDap-1360 Revision F FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.12b01cpe:2.3:o:dlink:dap-1360_revision_f_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDap-1360 Revision F\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.44% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.43%  1.44%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-09-18  1.19%  1.43%  +0.24 \n 3  2023-04-27  1.18%  1.19%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.14%  1.18%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10171", "ref_desc": "D-Link Technical SupportPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://c1a.eu/dlink-dap-1360.html", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://daschloer.github.io/sec/dlink-dap-1360.html", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
