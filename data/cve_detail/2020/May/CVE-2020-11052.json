{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11052", "Description": "In Sorcery before 0.15.0, there is a brute force vulnerability when using password authentication via Sorcery. The brute force protection submodule will prevent a brute force attack for the defined lockout period, but once expired, protection will not be re-enabled until a user or malicious actor logs in successfully. This does not affect users that do not use the built-in brute force protection submodule, nor users that use permanent account lockout. This has been patched in 0.15.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11052", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSorcery Project\u00bbSorcery\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 0.15.0cpe:2.3:a:sorcery_project:sorcery:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-03-11  0.28%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-02-25  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.23%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/commit/0f116d223826895a73b12492f17486e5d54ab7a7", "ref_desc": "Fix brute force vuln due to callbacks not being ran (#235) \u00b7 Sorcery/sorcery@0f116d2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/pull/235", "ref_desc": "Fix brute force vuln due to callbacks not being ran by athix \u00b7 Pull Request #235 \u00b7 Sorcery/sorcery \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/security/advisories/GHSA-jc8m-cxhj-668x", "ref_desc": "Brute Force Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sorcery/sorcery \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/issues/231", "ref_desc": "brute force vulnerability \u00b7 Issue #231 \u00b7 Sorcery/sorcery \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
