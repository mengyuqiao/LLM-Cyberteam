{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12801", "Description": "If LibreOffice has an encrypted document open and crashes, that document is auto-saved encrypted. On restart, LibreOffice offers to restore the document and prompts for the password to decrypt it. If the recovery is successful, and if the file format of the recovered document was not LibreOffice's default ODF file format, then affected versions of LibreOffice default that subsequent saves of the document are unencrypted. This may lead to a user accidentally saving a MSOffice file format document unencrypted while believing it to be encrypted. This issue affects: LibreOffice 6-3 series versions prior to 6.3.6; 6-4 series versions prior to 6.4.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12801", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLibreoffice\u00bbLibreofficeVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.0andbefore (<) 6.4.3cpe:2.3:a:libreoffice:libreoffice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLibreoffice\u00bbLibreofficeVersions  from including (>=) 6.3.0andbefore (<) 6.3.6cpe:2.3:a:libreoffice:libreoffice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-22  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-03-07  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-01  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00026.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3703-1] libreoffice security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/a1i56dF7Kzlc4dlraeHHtw2e5qs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/CVE-2020-12801", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-12801 | LibreOffice - Free Office Suite - Based on OpenOffice - Compatible with MicrosoftVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-06/msg00011.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0786-1: moderate: Security update fMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
