{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-20802", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Readdle Documents app before 6.9.7 for iOS. The application's file-transfer web server improperly displays directory names, leading to Stored XSS, which may be used to steal a user's data. This requires user interaction because there is no known direct way for an attacker to create a crafted directory name on a victim's device. However, a crafted directory name can occur if a victim extracts a ZIP archive that was provided by an attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20802", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nReaddle\u00bbDocuments\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 6.9.7cpe:2.3:a:readdle:documents:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://logicaltrust.net/blog/2019/12/documents.html#xss", "ref_desc": "Security Audits, Penetration Tests - LogicalTrust - [EN] A-Z: Documents - hacking web app inside iOS appExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/documents-by-readdle/id364901807", "ref_desc": "\u200eDocuments by Readdle on the App\u00a0StoreProduct;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UbQSjOI1jzrm-oPgo9gTWba2V4k.html"}]}
