{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3178", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based GUI of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities are due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by intercepting an HTTP request and modifying it to redirect a user to a specific malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page or to obtain sensitive browser-based information. This type of attack is commonly referred to as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks to get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3178", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbContent Security Management ApplianceVersions  before (<) 13.6.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:content_security_management_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-10  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-opn-rdrct-yPPMdsMQ", "ref_desc": "Cisco Content Security Management Appliance Open Redirect VulnerabilitiesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
