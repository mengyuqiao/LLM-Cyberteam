{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11443", "Description": "The Zoom IT installer for Windows (ZoomInstallerFull.msi) prior to version 4.6.10 deletes files located in %APPDATA%\\Zoom before installing an updated version of the client. Standard users are able to write to this directory, and can write links to other directories on the machine. As the installer runs with SYSTEM privileges and follows these links, a user can cause the installer to delete files that otherwise cannot be deleted by the user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11443", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZoom\u00bbIt Installer\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 4.6.10cpe:2.3:a:zoom:it_installer:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360043036451-Security-CVE-2020-11443", "ref_desc": "Security: CVE-2020-11443 \u2013 Zoom Help CenterBroken Link;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201361953-New-Updates-for-Windows", "ref_desc": "New updates for Windows \u2013 Zoom Help CenterBroken Link;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360043036451", "ref_desc": "Security: CVE-2020-11443 \u2013 Zoom Help CenterBroken Link;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
