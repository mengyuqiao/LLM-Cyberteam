{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11055", "Description": "In BookStack greater than or equal to 0.18.0 and less than 0.29.2, there is an XSS vulnerability in comment creation. A user with permission to create comments could POST HTML directly to the system to be saved in a comment, which would then be executed/displayed to others users viewing the comment. Through this vulnerability custom JavaScript code could be injected and therefore ran on other user machines. This most impacts scenarios where not-trusted users are given permission to create comments. This has been fixed in 0.29.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11055", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBookstackapp\u00bbBookstackVersions  from including (>=) 0.18.0andbefore (<) 0.29.2cpe:2.3:a:bookstackapp:bookstack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-5vf7-q87h-pg6w", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting Through Comment Creation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN41035278/index.html", "ref_desc": "JVN#41035278: BookStack vulnerable to cross-site scriptingThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bookstackapp.com/blog/beta-release-v0-29-2/", "ref_desc": "Beta Security Release v0.29.2 \u00b7 BookStackRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.29.2", "ref_desc": "Release BookStack Beta v0.29.2 \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
