{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10030", "Description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0. It allows an attacker (with enough privileges to change the system's hostname) to cause disclosure of uninitialized memory content via a stack-based out-of-bounds read. It only occurs on systems where gethostname() does not have '\\0' termination of the returned string if the hostname is larger than the supplied buffer. (Linux systems are not affected because the buffer is always large enough. OpenBSD systems are not affected because the returned hostname always has '\\0' termination.) Under some conditions, this issue can lead to the writing of one '\\0' byte out-of-bounds on the stack, causing a denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10030", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPowerdns\u00bbRecursorVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.3.0cpe:2.3:a:powerdns:recursor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-23  0.83%  0.58%  -0.24 \n 2  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.83%  -1.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NMP72NJGKBWR5WEBXAWX5KSLQUDFTG6S/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: pdns-recursor-4.2.2-1.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8MwxVtvpt5UvHKGegjDQk792Za8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PS4ZN5XGENYNFKX7QIIOUCQQHXE37GJF/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: pdns-recursor-4.3.1-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/flB6UEGQk6Q4YqemVGDKlWJNyxQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2020-03.html", "ref_desc": "PowerDNS Security Advisory 2020-03: Information disclosure \u2014 PowerDNS Recursor documentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00052.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0698-1: moderate: Security update fCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/O-LqpNuTn6PUT897Gzc87TZNlOw.html"}]}
