{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10737", "Description": "A race condition was found in the mkhomedir tool shipped with the oddjob package in versions before 0.34.5 and 0.34.6 wherein, during the home creation, mkhomedir copies the /etc/skel directory into the newly created home and changes its ownership to the home's user without properly checking the homedir path. This flaw allows an attacker to leverage this issue by creating a symlink point to a target folder, which then has its ownership transferred to the new home directory's unprivileged user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10737", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOddjobVersions  before (<) 0.34.5cpe:2.3:a:redhat:oddjob:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 \n 2  2023-02-23  1.40%  0.89%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pagure.io/oddjob/c/10b8aaa1564b723a005b53acc069df71313f4cac?branch", "ref_desc": "Commit - oddjob - 10b8aaa1564b723a005b53acc069df71313f4cac - Pagure.ioPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-10737", "ref_desc": "1833042 \u2013 (CVE-2020-10737) CVE-2020-10737 oddjob: race condition in oddjob_selinux_mkdir function in mkhomedir.c can lead to symlink attackIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
