{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10187", "Description": "Doorkeeper version 5.0.0 and later contains an information disclosure vulnerability that allows an attacker to retrieve the client secret only intended for the OAuth application owner. After authorizing the application and allowing access, the attacker simply needs to request the list of their authorized applications in a JSON format (usually GET /oauth/authorized_applications.json). An application is vulnerable if the authorized applications controller is enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10187", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDoorkeeper Project\u00bbDoorkeeper\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 5.1.0andbefore (<) 5.1.1cpe:2.3:a:doorkeeper_project:doorkeeper:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nDoorkeeper Project\u00bbDoorkeeper\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.3cpe:2.3:a:doorkeeper_project:doorkeeper:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nDoorkeeper Project\u00bbDoorkeeper\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 5.3.0andbefore (<) 5.3.2cpe:2.3:a:doorkeeper_project:doorkeeper:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nDoorkeeper Project\u00bbDoorkeeper\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 5.2.0andbefore (<) 5.2.5cpe:2.3:a:doorkeeper_project:doorkeeper:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-08  0.15%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-02-22  0.13%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.13%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/commit/25d038022c2fcad45af5b73f9d003cf38ff491f6", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-j7vx-8mqj-cqp9 \u00b7 doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper@25d0380 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/pull/446", "ref_desc": "Add CVE-2020-10187 for doorkeeper by stefansundin \u00b7 Pull Request #446 \u00b7 rubysec/ruby-advisory-db \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/security/advisories/GHSA-j7vx-8mqj-cqp9", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-10187 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
