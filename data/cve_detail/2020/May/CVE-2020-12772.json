{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12772", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Ignite Realtime Spark 2.8.3 (and the ROAR plugin for it) on Windows. A chat message can include an IMG element with a SRC attribute referencing an external host's IP address. Upon access to this external host, the (NT)LM hashes of the user are sent with the HTTP request. This allows an attacker to collect these hashes, crack them, and potentially compromise the computer. (ROAR can be configured for automatic access. Also, access can occur if the user clicks.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12772", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nIgniterealtime\u00bbSpark\u00bbVersion:2.8.3cpe:2.3:a:igniterealtime:spark:2.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.63%  +0.38 \n 2  2023-09-15  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/theart42/cves/blob/master/cve-2020-12772/CVE-2020-12772.md", "ref_desc": "cves/CVE-2020-12772.md at master \u00b7 theart42/cves \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
