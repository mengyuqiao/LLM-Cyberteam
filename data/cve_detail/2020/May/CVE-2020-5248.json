{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5248", "Description": "GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5248", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpiVersions  before (<) 9.4.6cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  4.50%  0.07%  -4.43 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-j222-j9mf-h6j9", "ref_desc": "Public GLPIKEY can be used to decrypt any data \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/commit/efd14468c92c4da43333aa9735e65fd20cbc7c6c", "ref_desc": "Deprecate GLPIKEY usage \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi@efd1446 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
