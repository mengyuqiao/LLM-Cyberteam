{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13021", "Description": "The administrative passwords for all versions of Bond JetSelect are stored within an unprotected file on the filesystem, rather than encrypted within the MySQL database. This backup copy of the passwords is made as part of the installation script, after the administrator has generated a password using ENCtool.jar (see CVE-2019-13022). This allows any low-privilege user who can read this file to trivially obtain the passwords for the administrative accounts of the JetSelect application. The path to the file containing the encoded password hash is /opt/JetSelect/SFC/resources/sfc-general-properties.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13021", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJetstream\u00bbJetselectcpe:2.3:a:jetstream:jetselect:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-09-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-04-06  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://labs.nettitude.com/blog/cve-2019-13021-22-23-jetselect-network-segregation-application/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-13021, 22, 23: JETSELECT Network Segregation Application \u2014 Nettitude LabsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CKaJlcifor4kqXLZgYeFCGgzXNM.html"}]}
