{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12691", "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themselves for a project that they have a specified role on, and then perform an update to the credential user and project, allowing them to masquerade as another user. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12691", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:18.04    LTSEditioncpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:18.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbKeystoneVersions  before (<) 15.0.1cpe:2.3:a:openstack:keystone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbKeystone\u00bbVersion:16.0.0cpe:2.3:a:openstack:keystone:16.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.07%  0.37%  -0.69 \n 2  2024-08-30  0.77%  1.07%  +0.30 \n 3  2024-03-27  0.56%  0.77%  +0.20 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.28%  0.56%  +0.28 \n 5  2023-04-25  0.21%  0.28%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.21%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/05/07/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: [OSSA-2020-004] Keystone: Keystone credential endpoints allow owner modification and are not protected from a scoped context (CVE PENDING)Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_vbUH0vDJvcRF-tBfSjrWLGcdHY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re237267da268c690df5e1c6ea6a38a7fc11617725e8049490f58a6fa@%3Ccommits.druid.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[druid] branch master updated: Suppress CVE-2021-27568 from json-smart 2.3 dependency (#11438) - Pony MailMailing List;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/a8JyDgeVvI7d1xEIbcJWZeLqMKI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2020-004.html", "ref_desc": "OpenStack Docs: OSSA-2020-004: Keystone credential endpoints allow owner modification and are not protected from a scoped contextVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bdkI5EQwIxJT76wHOqRoQ6XVmWQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4480-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-4480-1: OpenStack Keystone vulnerabilities | Ubuntu security notices | UbuntuThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eJYLT2-fVM9bkRfxDpICKT-ElJ0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/05/06/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [OSSA-2020-004] Keystone: Keystone credential endpoints allow owner modification and are not protected from a scoped context (CVE PENDING)Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JneEY8K6F9T_Im2ySWAv1n7ZDxY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1872733", "ref_desc": "Bug #1872733 \u201cKeystone V3 /credentials endpoint policy logic all...\u201d : Bugs : OpenStack Identity (keystone)Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re4ffc55cd2f1b55a26e07c83b3c22c3fe4bae6054d000a57fb48d8c2@%3Ccommits.druid.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[GitHub] [druid] ccaominh opened a new pull request #9903: Suppress CVEs for openstack-keystone - Pony MailMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zryYmf5MJdDEIGKonFfLHPQzKF0.html"}]}
