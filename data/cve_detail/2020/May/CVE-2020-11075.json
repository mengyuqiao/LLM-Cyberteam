{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11075", "Description": "In Anchore Engine version 0.7.0, a specially crafted container image manifest, fetched from a registry, can be used to trigger a shell escape flaw in the anchore engine analyzer service during an image analysis process. The image analysis operation can only be executed by an authenticated user via a valid API request to anchore engine, or if an already added image that anchore is monitoring has its manifest altered to exploit the same flaw. A successful attack can be used to execute commands that run in the analyzer environment, with the same permissions as the user that anchore engine is run as - including access to the credentials that Engine uses to access its own database which have read-write ability, as well as access to the running engien analyzer service environment. By default Anchore Engine is released and deployed as a container where the user is non-root, but if users run Engine directly or explicitly set the user to 'root' then that level of access may be gained in the execution environment where Engine runs. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11075", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAnchore\u00bbEngine\u00bbVersion:0.7.0cpe:2.3:a:anchore:engine:0.7.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-16  0.19%  0.24%  +0.06 \n 2  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.19%  -2.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-114 Process Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/114/Process-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine/issues/430", "ref_desc": "Ensure only supported os overrides are used in skopeo download commands \u00b7 Issue #430 \u00b7 anchore/anchore-engine \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine/security/advisories/GHSA-w4rm-w22x-h7m5", "ref_desc": "Shell Escape in analyzer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anchore/anchore-engine \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine/commit/e41786901f097fd32104447a45864073105d37db", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #431 from anchore/dev/nurmi/osoverride_skopeo_update \u00b7 anchore/anchore-engine@e417869 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine/pull/431", "ref_desc": "Ensure only supported os overrides are used in skopeo download comman\u2026 by nurmi \u00b7 Pull Request #431 \u00b7 anchore/anchore-engine \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
