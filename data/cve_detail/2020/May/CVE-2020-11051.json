{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11051", "Description": "In Wiki.js before 2.3.81, there is a stored XSS in the Markdown editor. An editor with write access to a page, using the Markdown editor, could inject an XSS payload into the content. If another editor (with write access as well) load the same page into the Markdown editor, the XSS payload will be executed as part of the preview panel. The rendered result does not contain the XSS payload as it is stripped by the HTML Sanitization security module. This vulnerability only impacts editors loading the malicious page in the Markdown editor. This has been patched in 2.3.81.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11051", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRequarks\u00bbWiki.jsVersions  before (<) 2.3.81cpe:2.3:a:requarks:wiki.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/05e8a71ceff39167aee830ba8ad5eb0161f2911a", "ref_desc": "fix: sanitize markdown preview on content change \u00b7 Requarks/wiki@05e8a71 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-vj72-c9vq-qxrv", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in Markdown editor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
