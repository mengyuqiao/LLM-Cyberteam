{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1959", "Description": "A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in Apache Syncope prior to 2.1.6 enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Apache Syncope uses Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators. When building custom constraint violation error messages, they support different types of interpolation, including Java EL expressions. Therefore, if an attacker can inject arbitrary data in the error message template being passed, they will be able to run arbitrary Java code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1959", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSyncopeVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andbefore (<) 2.1.6cpe:2.3:a:apache:syncope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.21%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-917 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/917/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-Expre.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://syncope.apache.org/security", "ref_desc": "Apache Syncope \u2013 Security AdvisoriesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/T0JKKQ3WrOWGU0KYNMHgaU83ik4.html"}]}
