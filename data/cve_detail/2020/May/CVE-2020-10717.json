{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10717", "Description": "A potential DoS flaw was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon (virtiofsd) implementation of the QEMU version >= v5.0. Virtio-fs is meant to share a host file system directory with a guest via virtio-fs device. If the guest opens the maximum number of file descriptors under the shared directory, a denial of service may occur. This flaw allows a guest user/process to cause this denial of service on the host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10717", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nQemu\u00bbQemuVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.0.1cpe:2.3:a:qemu:qemu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 \n 2  2023-02-22  1.67%  0.95%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/05/04/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2020-10717 QEMU: virtiofsd: guest may open maximum file descriptor to cause DoSMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-10717", "ref_desc": "1827808 \u2013 (CVE-2020-10717) CVE-2020-10717 QEMU: virtiofsd: guest may open maximum file descriptor to cause DoSIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg00143.html", "ref_desc": "[PULL 2/6] virtiofsd: stay below fs.file-max sysctl value (CVE-2020-1071Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202011-09", "ref_desc": "QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202011-09) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Qa5MJNkE85d1SyWDC-GNySW6S60.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg00141.html", "ref_desc": "[PULL 0/6] virtiofs queueMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
