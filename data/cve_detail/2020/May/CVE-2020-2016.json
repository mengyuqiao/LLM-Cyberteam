{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-2016", "Description": "A race condition due to insecure creation of a file in a temporary directory vulnerability in PAN-OS allows for root privilege escalation from a limited linux user account. This allows an attacker who has escaped the restricted shell as a low privilege administrator, possibly by exploiting another vulnerability, to escalate privileges to become root user. This issue affects: PAN-OS 7.1 versions earlier than 7.1.26; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.13; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.6; All versions of PAN-OS 8.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2016", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.0.20cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.0.6cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 7.1.0andbefore (<) 7.1.26cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 8.1.0andbefore (<) 8.1.13cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-377 Insecure Temporary File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/377/Insecure-Temporary-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2016", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-2016 PAN-OS: Temporary file race condition vulnerability in PAN-OS leads to local privilege escalationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
