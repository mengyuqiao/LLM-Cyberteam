{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3329", "Description": "A vulnerability in role-based access control of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow a read-only authenticated, remote attacker to disable user accounts on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect allocation of the enable/disable action button under the role-based access control code on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as a read-only user and then updating the roles of other users to disable them. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable users, including administrative users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3329", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUcs DirectorVersions  from including (>=) 5.4.0.0andbefore (<) 6.7.4.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIntegrated Management Controller SupervisorVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:integrated_management_controller_supervisor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUcs Director Express For Big DataVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0.0andbefore (<) 3.7.4.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director_express_for_big_data:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucsd-Ar6BAguz", "ref_desc": "Cisco IMC Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data Role-Based Access Control VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
