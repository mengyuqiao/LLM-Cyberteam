{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1955", "Description": "CouchDB version 3.0.0 shipped with a new configuration setting that governs access control to the entire database server called `require_valid_user_except_for_up`. It was meant as an extension to the long standing setting `require_valid_user`, which in turn requires that any and all requests to CouchDB will have to be made with valid credentials, effectively forbidding any anonymous requests. The new `require_valid_user_except_for_up` is an off-by-default setting that was meant to allow requiring valid credentials for all endpoints except for the `/_up` endpoint. However, the implementation of this made an error that lead to not enforcing credentials on any endpoint, when enabled. CouchDB versions 3.0.1[1] and 3.1.0[2] fix this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1955", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCouchdb\u00bbVersion:3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:couchdb:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-12  0.21%  0.15%  -0.06 \n 2  2023-03-16  0.30%  0.21%  -0.09 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.30%  -0.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/cve/2020-1955.html", "ref_desc": "2.13.
