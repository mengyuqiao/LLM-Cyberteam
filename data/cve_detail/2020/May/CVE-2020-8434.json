{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8434", "Description": "Jenzabar JICS (aka Internet Campus Solution) before 9.0.1 Patch 3, 9.1 before 9.1.2 Patch 2, and 9.2 before 9.2.2 Patch 8 has session cookies that are a deterministic function of the username. There is a hard-coded password to supply a PBKDF feeding into AES to encrypt a username and base64 encode it to a client-side cookie for persistent session authentication. By knowing the key and algorithm, an attacker can select any username, encrypt it, base64 encode it, and save it in their browser with the correct JICSLoginCookie cookie format to impersonate any real user in the JICS database without the need for authenticating (or verifying with MFA if implemented).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8434", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJenzabar\u00bbInternet Campus SolutionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.0.1cpe:2.3:a:jenzabar:internet_campus_solution:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenzabar\u00bbInternet Campus SolutionVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.1.2cpe:2.3:a:jenzabar:internet_campus_solution:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJenzabar\u00bbInternet Campus SolutionVersions  from including (>=) 9.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.2.2cpe:2.3:a:jenzabar:internet_campus_solution:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-08  0.52%  0.22%  -0.30 \n 2  2023-09-22  0.49%  0.52%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-04-11  0.35%  0.49%  +0.14 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.35%  -0.53 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/@mdavis332/higher-ed-erp-portal-vulnerability-auth-bypass-to-login-any-account-f1aeef438f80", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
