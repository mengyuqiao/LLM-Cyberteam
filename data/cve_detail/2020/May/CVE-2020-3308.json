{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3308", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Image Signature Verification feature of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrator-level credentials to install a malicious software patch on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper verification of digital signatures for patch images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an unsigned software patch to bypass signature checks and loading it on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software patch image.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3308", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  before (<) 6.2.2.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.2.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.2.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sigbypass-FcvPPCeP", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software Signature Verification Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
