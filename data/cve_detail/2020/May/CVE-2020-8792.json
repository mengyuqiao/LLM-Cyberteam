{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8792", "Description": "The OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3) has an information-exposure issue. In the mobile app, an attempt to add an already-bound lock by its barcode reveals the email address of the account to which the lock is bound, as well as the name of the lock. Valid barcode inputs can be easily guessed because barcode strings follow a predictable pattern. Correctly guessed valid barcode inputs entered through the app interface disclose arbitrary users' email addresses and lock names.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8792", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOklok Project\u00bbOklok\u00bbVersion:3.1.1ForIphone Oscpe:2.3:a:oklok_project:oklok:3.1.1:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fierceoj/ownklok", "ref_desc": "GitHub - fierceoj/ownklok: PoC code for vulnerabilities on the OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3).Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/peOMI9UMXkkoPOKMcvzUUY-wCo4.html"}]}
