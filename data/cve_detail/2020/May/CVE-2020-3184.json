{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3184", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface improperly validates user input for specific SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application with valid administrative credentials and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view information that they are not authorized to view, make changes to the system that they are not authorized to make, or delete information from the database that they are not authorized to delete.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3184", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime Collaboration ProvisioningVersions  before (<) 12.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_collaboration_provisioning:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbPrime Collaboration Provisioning\u00bbVersion:12.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_collaboration_provisioning:12.6:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbPrime Collaboration Provisioning\u00bbVersion:12.6UpdateService Update1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_collaboration_provisioning:12.6:service_update1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-pcp-sql-inj-22Auwt66", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software SQL Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
