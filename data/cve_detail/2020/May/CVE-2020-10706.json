{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10706", "Description": "A flaw was found in OpenShift Container Platform where OAuth tokens are not encrypted when the encryption of data at rest is enabled. This flaw allows an attacker with access to a backup to obtain OAuth tokens and then use them to log into the cluster as any user who logged into the cluster via the WebUI or via the command line in the last 24 hours. Once the backup is older than 24 hours the OAuth tokens are no longer valid.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10706", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container Platform\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 \n 2  2023-02-13  0.95%  0.89%  -0.07 \n 3  2023-02-03  0.89%  0.95%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-10706", "ref_desc": "1819011 \u2013 (CVE-2020-10706) CVE-2020-10706 openshift/openshift-apiserver: oauth tokens not encrypted when enabling encryption of data at restIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
