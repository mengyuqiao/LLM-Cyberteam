{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-20794", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.18 through 5.6.11 when unprivileged user namespaces are allowed. A user can create their own PID namespace, and mount a FUSE filesystem. Upon interaction with this FUSE filesystem, if the userspace component is terminated via a kill of the PID namespace's pid 1, it will result in a hung task, and resources being permanently locked up until system reboot. This can result in resource exhaustion.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20794", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 4.18andup to, including, (<=) 5.6.11cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/772/Missing-Release-of-Resource-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/08/24/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2019-20794 kernel: task processes not being properly ended could lead to resource exhaustionMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sargun/fuse-example", "ref_desc": "GitHub - sargun/fuse-example: An Example FUSE Filesystem Turned into an Exploit VectorExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sourceforge.net/p/fuse/mailman/message/36598753/", "ref_desc": "Filesystem in Userspace / [fuse-devel] Kernel Hung in FUSEExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200608-0001/", "ref_desc": "May 2020 Linux Kernel Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fXIf1QOPY57K65zh5TIdg-rfI9E.html"}]}
