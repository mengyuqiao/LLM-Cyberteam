{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8791", "Description": "The OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3) allows remote attackers to submit API requests using authenticated but unauthorized tokens, resulting in IDOR issues. A remote attacker can use their own token to make unauthorized API requests on behalf of arbitrary user IDs. Valid and current user IDs are trivial to guess because of the user ID assignment convention used by the app. A remote attacker could harvest email addresses, unsalted MD5 password hashes, owner-assigned lock names, and owner-assigned fingerprint names for any range of arbitrary user IDs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8791", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOklok Project\u00bbOklok\u00bbVersion:3.1.1ForIphone Oscpe:2.3:a:oklok_project:oklok:3.1.1:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.25%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-06-13  0.23%  0.31%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-01-20  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-09-07  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.22%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fierceoj/ownklok", "ref_desc": "GitHub - fierceoj/ownklok: PoC code for vulnerabilities on the OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3).Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/peOMI9UMXkkoPOKMcvzUUY-wCo4.html"}]}
