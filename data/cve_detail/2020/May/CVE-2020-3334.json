{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3334", "Description": "A vulnerability in the ARP packet processing of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of ARP packets received by the management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of unicast ARP packets in a short timeframe that would reach the management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume resources on an affected device, which would prevent the device from sending internal system keepalives and eventually cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3334", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 9.10andbefore (<) 9.10.1.37cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 9.13andbefore (<) 9.13.1.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 9.12andbefore (<) 9.12.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  before (<) 6.6.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 2110\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 2120\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 2130\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 2140\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fp2100-arp-dos-kLdCK8ks", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances ARP Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
