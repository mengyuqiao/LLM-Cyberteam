{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3280", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Java Remote Management Interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious serialized Java object to a specific listener on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on an affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3280", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Contact Center ExpressVersions  from including (>=) 12.0andbefore (<) 12.0\\(1\\)es03cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.87% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.74%  0.87%  -0.87 \n 2  2024-03-09  1.53%  1.74%  +0.20 \n 3  2024-02-07  1.59%  1.53%  -0.06 \n 4  2023-06-09  2.24%  1.59%  -0.65 \n 5  2023-04-28  2.13%  2.24%  +0.12 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.16%  2.13%  +0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-uccx-rce-GMSC6RKN", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Contact Center Express Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
