{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10134", "Description": "Pairing in Bluetooth\u00ae Core v5.2 and earlier may permit an unauthenticated attacker to acquire credentials with two pairing devices via adjacent access when the unauthenticated user initiates different pairing methods in each peer device and an end-user erroneously completes both pairing procedures with the MITM using the confirmation number of one peer as the passkey of the other. An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker could be able to initiate any Bluetooth operation on either attacked device exposed by the enabled Bluetooth profiles. This exposure may be limited when the user must authorize certain access explicitly, but so long as a user assumes that it is the intended remote device requesting permissions, device-local protections may be weakened.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10134", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBluetooth\u00bbBluetooth Core\u00bb     BREditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.2cpe:2.3:a:bluetooth:bluetooth_core:*:*:*:*:br:*:*:*Matching versions\nBluetooth\u00bbBluetooth Core\u00bb     LEEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.2cpe:2.3:a:bluetooth:bluetooth_core:*:*:*:*:le:*:*:*Matching versions\nBluetooth\u00bbBluetooth Core\u00bb     EDREditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.2cpe:2.3:a:bluetooth:bluetooth_core:*:*:*:*:edr:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-351 Insufficient Type Distinction", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/351/Insufficient-Type-Distinction.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/method-vulnerability/", "ref_desc": "Security Notice | Bluetooth\u00ae Technology WebsiteVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/534195/", "ref_desc": "VU#534195 - Bluetooth devices supporting LE and specific BR/EDR implementations are vulnerable to method confusion attacksThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
