{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3285", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security version 1.3 (TLS 1.3) policy with URL category functionality for Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured TLS 1.3 policy to block traffic for a specific URL. The vulnerability is due to a logic error with Snort handling of the connection with the TLS 1.3 policy and URL category configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS 1.3 connections to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the TLS 1.3 policy and access URLs that are outside the affected device and normally would be dropped.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3285", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.0andup to, including, (<=) 6.4.0.8cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ssl-bypass-O5tGum2n", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SSL/TLS URL Category Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
