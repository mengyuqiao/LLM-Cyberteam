{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15008", "Description": "A SQLi exists in the probe code of all Connectwise Automate versions before 2020.7 or 2019.12. A SQL Injection in the probe implementation to save data to a custom table exists due to inadequate server side validation. As the code creates dynamic SQL for the insert statement and utilizes the user supplied table name with little validation, the table name can be modified to allow arbitrary update commands to be run. Usage of other SQL injection techniques such as timing attacks, it is possible to perform full data extraction as well.
