{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15128", "Description": "In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework to decrypt it for them. Issue has been fixed in build 468 (v1.0.468).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15128", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  before (<) 1.0.468cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-565 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/565/Reliance-on-Cookies-without-Validation-and-Integrity-Checkin.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/28310d4fb336a1741b39498f4474497644a6875c", "ref_desc": "Improvements to cookie value validation (#508) \u00b7 octobercms/library@28310d4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/library/pull/508", "ref_desc": "Improvements to cookie value validation by LukeTowers \u00b7 Pull Request #508 \u00b7 octobercms/library \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-55mm-5399-7r63", "ref_desc": "Encrypted cookie values are not tied to the cookie name \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
