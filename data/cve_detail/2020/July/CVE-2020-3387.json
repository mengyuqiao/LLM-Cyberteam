{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3387", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute code with root privileges on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization during user authentication processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted response to the Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the software and execute commands they should not be authorized to execute.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3387", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 18.4.0andbefore (<) 19.2.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:sd-wan_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltegb Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltena Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-6g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 18.3.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:sd-wan_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltegb Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltena Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-6g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 19.3.0andbefore (<) 20.1.1.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:sd-wan_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltegb Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltena Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-6g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.47%  0.50%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.33%  0.47%  +0.14 \n 3  2024-07-22  0.23%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 4  2023-11-19  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-18  0.24%  0.22%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.24%  -1.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162958/Cisco-SD-WAN-vManage-19.2.2-Remote-Root.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage 19.2.2 Remote Root \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ObsO5F-WmFQnlIbgJxueE2ucGS0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanrce-4jtWT28P", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
