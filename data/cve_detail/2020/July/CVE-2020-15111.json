{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15111", "Description": "In Fiber before version 1.12.6, the filename that is given in c.Attachment() (https://docs.gofiber.io/ctx#attachment) is not escaped, and therefore vulnerable for a CRLF injection attack. I.e. an attacker could upload a custom filename and then give the link to the victim. With this filename, the attacker can change the name of the downloaded file, redirect to another site, change the authorization header, etc. A possible workaround is to serialize the input before passing it to ctx.Attachment().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15111", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGofiber\u00bbFiberVersions  before (<) 1.12.6cpe:2.3:a:gofiber:fiber:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-93 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/93/Improper-Neutralization-of-CRLF-Sequences-CRLF-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/579/commits/f698b5d5066cfe594102ae252cd58a1fe57cf56f", "ref_desc": "\ud83d\udc1b Escape fname by Fenny \u00b7 Pull Request #579 \u00b7 gofiber/fiber \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-9cx9-x2gp-9qvh", "ref_desc": "CRLF vulnerability in c.Attachment() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gofiber/fiber \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
