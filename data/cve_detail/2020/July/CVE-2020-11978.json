{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11978", "Description": "An issue was found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. A remote code/command injection vulnerability was discovered in one of the example DAGs shipped with Airflow which would allow any authenticated user to run arbitrary commands as the user running airflow worker/scheduler (depending on the executor in use). If you already have examples disabled by setting load_examples=False in the config then you are not vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11978", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbAirflowVersions  before (<) 1.10.11cpe:2.3:a:apache:airflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.39%  97.30%  -0.09 \n 2  2024-11-27  97.40%  97.39%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-10-25  97.42%  97.40%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-09-10  97.42%  97.42%  0.00 \n 5  2024-07-25  97.45%  97.42%  -0.03 \n 6  2024-07-23  97.44%  97.45%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-05-20  97.42%  97.44%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-04-17  97.43%  97.42%  0.00 \n 9  2024-02-11  97.41%  97.43%  +0.02 \n 10  2024-02-07  97.16%  97.41%  +0.25 \n 11  2023-11-19  97.20%  97.16%  -0.05 \n 12  2023-10-18  97.20%  97.20%  0.00 \n 13  2023-10-03  97.11%  97.20%  +0.10 \n 14  2023-09-22  97.38%  97.11%  -0.27 \n 15  2023-09-20  97.52%  97.38%  -0.15 \n 16  2023-06-08  97.54%  97.52%  -0.02 \n 17  2023-04-27  97.53%  97.54%  +0.01 \n 18  2023-04-01  97.54%  97.53%  -0.01 \n 19  2023-03-07  16.53%  97.54%  +81.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r7255cf0be3566f23a768e2a04b40fb09e52fcd1872695428ba9afe91%40%3Cusers.airflow.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Apache Airflow security vulnerabilities fixed in v1.10.11: CVE-2020-9485, CVE-2020-11978, CVE-2020-11981, CVE-2020-11982, CVE-2020-11983, CVE-2020-13927 - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B9YA_vESmS7HGZf7X-bj_Degl3c.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174764/Apache-Airflow-1.10.10-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Airflow 1.10.10 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OI5OuKHjZgWtaCsA_0wHsBPfNec.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162908/Apache-Airflow-1.10.10-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Airflow 1.10.10 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pYIDtXm30ZJlCFd_oTrYsFcbeNA.html"}]}
