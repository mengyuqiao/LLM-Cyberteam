The vulnerability is due to insufficient file scope limiting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specific file reference on the filesystem and then accessing it through the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the filesystem of the underlying operating system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3437", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan FirmwareVersions  before (<) 19.2.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:sd-wan_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.29%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.14%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-04-01  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-11-19  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanwebid-5QWMcCvt", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162958/Cisco-SD-WAN-vManage-19.2.2-Remote-Root.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage 19.2.2 Remote Root \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ObsO5F-WmFQnlIbgJxueE2ucGS0.html"}]}
