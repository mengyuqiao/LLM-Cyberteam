{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3381", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and obtain read and write access to sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of files that are uploaded to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to view or modify arbitrary files on the targeted system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3381", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 18.4.0andbefore (<) 19.2.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:sd-wan_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltegb Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltena Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-6g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 18.3.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:sd-wan_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltegb Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltena Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-6g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 19.3.0andup to, including, (<=) 20.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:sd-wan_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltegb Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltena Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-6g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-11  0.35%  0.33%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-04-01  0.36%  0.35%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.36%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmdirtrav-eFdAxsJg", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Directory Traversal VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
