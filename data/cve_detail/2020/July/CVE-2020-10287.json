{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10287", "Description": "The IRC5 family with UAS service enabled comes by default with credentials that can be found on publicly available manuals. ABB considers this a well documented functionality that helps customer set up however, out of our research, we found multiple production systems running these exact default credentials and consider thereby this an exposure that should be mitigated. Moreover, future deployments should consider that these defaults should be forbidden (user should be forced to change them).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10287", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nABB\u00bbIrb140 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:abb:irb140_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:ABB\u00bbIrb140\u00bbVersion:N/A\nABB\u00bbIrc5 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:abb:irc5_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:ABB\u00bbIrc5\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-31  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.20%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-255", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/255/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/3326", "ref_desc": "RVD#3326: Hardcoded default credentials on IRC 5 OPC Server \u00b7 Issue #3326 \u00b7 aliasrobotics/RVD \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
