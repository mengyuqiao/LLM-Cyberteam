{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3331", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input data by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3331", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv110w Wireless-n Vpn Firewall FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.2.2.8cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv110w_wireless-n_vpn_firewall_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv110w Wireless-n Vpn Firewall\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv215w Wireless-n Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.3.1.7cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv215w_wireless-n_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv215w Wireless-n Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-04  0.55%  0.54%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-01  0.40%  0.55%  +0.15 \n 3  2023-06-22  0.38%  0.40%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-04-01  0.35%  0.38%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.35%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-code-exec-wH3BNFb", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV110W and RV215W Series Routers Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
