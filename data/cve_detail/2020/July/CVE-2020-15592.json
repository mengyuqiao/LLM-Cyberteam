{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15592", "Description": "SteelCentral Aternity Agent before 11.0.0.120 on Windows allows Privilege Escalation via a crafted file. It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. The remotely callable methods from remotable objects available through interprocess communication allow loading of arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins\u201d directory, where the name of the plugin is passed as part of an XML-serialized object. However, because the name of the DLL is concatenated with the \u201c.\\plugins\u201d string, a directory traversal vulnerability exists in the way plugins are resolved.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15592", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRiverbed\u00bbSteelcentral Aternity AgentVersions  before (<) 11.0.0.120cpe:2.3:a:riverbed:steelcentral_aternity_agent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://aternity.force.com/customersuccess/s/article/Recorder-tool-security-notification-mitigation-steps-for-On-Prem", "ref_desc": "Login | Aternity Customer SuccessPermissions Required;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SsjAh0HSRWwowddaeVQix9Wz4rM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-steelcentral-aternity-agent-cve-2020-15592-cve-2020-15593/", "ref_desc": "Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in SteelCentral Aternity Agent \u2013 SEC ConsultThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vwOCw3A3Jv44LOvAPZNZCXxVGEw.html"}]}
