{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14000", "Description": "MIT Lifelong Kindergarten Scratch scratch-vm before 0.2.0-prerelease.20200714185213 loads extension URLs from untrusted project.json files with certain _ characters, resulting in remote code execution because the URL's content is treated as a script and is executed as a worker. The responsible code is getExtensionIdForOpcode in serialization/sb3.js. The use of _ is incompatible with a protection mechanism in older versions, in which URLs were split and consequently deserialization attacks were prevented. NOTE: the scratch.mit.edu hosted service is not affected because of the lack of worker scripts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14000", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMIT\u00bbScratch-vmVersions  before (<) 0.2.0-prerelease.20200714185213cpe:2.3:a:mit:scratch-vm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.27%  0.50%  -3.77 \n 2  2024-08-25  3.19%  4.27%  +1.08 \n 3  2024-05-05  2.83%  3.19%  +0.37 \n 4  2024-04-02  2.09%  2.83%  +0.74 \n 5  2023-09-17  1.48%  2.09%  +0.61 \n 6  2023-06-22  1.41%  1.48%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-04-01  1.21%  1.41%  +0.20 \n 8  2023-03-07  23.85%  1.21%  -22.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm/pull/2476", "ref_desc": "sanitize extension ID in getExtensionIdForOpcode by cwillisf \u00b7 Pull Request #2476 \u00b7 LLK/scratch-vm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/422904/?page=1#post-4223443", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-14000: Script Injection vulnerability in scratch-vm - Discuss ScratchVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
