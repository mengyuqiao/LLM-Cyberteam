{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15098", "Description": "In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20, and greater than or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, it has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains including potential privilege escalation, insecure deserialization & remote code execution. The overall severity of this vulnerability is high based on mentioned attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session (authenticated). This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15098", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code;Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.6cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.20cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  1.04%  +0.73 \n 2  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.32%  -4.25 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-325 Missing Cryptographic Step", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/325/Missing-Cryptographic-Step.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/commit/85d3e70dff35a99ef53f4b561114acfa9e5c47e1", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Avoid ambiguous HMAC results \u00b7 TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS@85d3e70 \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-m5vr-3m74-jwxp", "ref_desc": "Sensitive Information Disclosure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-008", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-008: Sensitive Information DisclosureVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2016-013", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2016-013: Missing Access Check in TYPO3 CMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
