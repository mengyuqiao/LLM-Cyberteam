{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6165", "Description": "SilverStripe 4.5.0 allows attackers to read certain records that should not have been placed into a result set. This affects silverstripe/recipe-cms. The automatic permission-checking mechanism in the silverstripe/graphql module does not provide complete protection against lists that are limited (e.g., through pagination), resulting in records that should have failed a permission check being added to the final result set. GraphQL endpoints are configured by default (e.g., for assets), but the admin/graphql endpoint is access protected by default. This limits the vulnerability to all authenticated users, including those with limited permissions (e.g., where viewing records exposed through admin/graphql requires administrator permissions). However, if custom GraphQL endpoints have been configured for a specific implementation (usually under /graphql), this vulnerability could also be exploited through unauthenticated requests. This vulnerability only applies to reading records; it does not allow unauthorised changing of records.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6165", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripeVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.4cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripeVersions  from including (>=) 4.5.0andbefore (<) 4.5.3cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripeVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.5andbefore (<) 3.3.0cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-31  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2020-6165", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-6165 Limited queries break CanViewPermissionChecker \u00bb SilverStripeVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
