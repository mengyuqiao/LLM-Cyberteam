{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14172", "Description": "This issue exists to document that a security improvement in the way that Jira Server and Data Center use velocity templates has been implemented. The way in which velocity templates were used in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center in affected versions allowed remote attackers to achieve remote code execution via insecure deserialization, if they were able to exploit a server side template injection vulnerability. The affected versions are before version 7.13.0, from version 8.0.0 before 8.5.0, and from version 8.6.0 before version 8.8.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14172", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAtlassian\u00bbJiraVersions  from including (>=) 8.6.0andbefore (<) 8.8.1cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJiraVersions  before (<) 7.13.0cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJiraVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.5.0cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJira Software Data CenterVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.5.0cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira_software_data_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJira Software Data CenterVersions  before (<) 7.13.0cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira_software_data_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJira Software Data CenterVersions  from including (>=) 8.6.0andbefore (<) 8.8.1cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira_software_data_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-06-08  0.27%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-18  0.23%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.23%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-70940", "ref_desc": "Log in to continue - Log in with Atlassian accountVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
