{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3374", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization, enabling them to access sensitive information, modify the system configuration, or impact the availability of the affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checking on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privileges beyond what would normally be authorized for their configured user authorization level. The attacker may be able to access sensitive information, modify the system configuration, or impact the availability of the affected system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3374", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 19.2.0andbefore (<) 19.2.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  up to, including, (<=) 18.3.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 18.4.0andbefore (<) 18.4.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 19.3.0andbefore (<) 20.1.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.21%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-uabvman-SYGzt8Bv", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Authorization Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
