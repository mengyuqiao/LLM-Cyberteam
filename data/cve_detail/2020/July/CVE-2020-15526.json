{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15526", "Description": "In Redgate SQL Monitor 7.1.4 through 10.1.6 (inclusive), the scope for disabling some TLS security certificate checks can extend beyond that defined by various options on the Configuration > Notifications pages to disable certificate checking for alert notifications. These TLS security checks are also ignored during monitoring of VMware machines. This would make SQL Monitor vulnerable to potential man-in-the-middle attacks when sending alert notification emails, posting to Slack or posting to webhooks. The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.1.7.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15526", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRed-gate\u00bbSql MonitorVersions  from including (>=) 7.1.4andup to, including, (<=) 10.1.6cpe:2.3:a:red-gate:sql_monitor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-25  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.red-gate.com/privacy-and-security/vulnerabilities/2020-07-08-sql-monitor", "ref_desc": "Security vulnerability in SQL Monitor (CVE-2020-15526)Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
