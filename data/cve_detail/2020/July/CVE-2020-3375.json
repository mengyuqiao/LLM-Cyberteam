{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3375", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN Solution Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to information that they are not authorized to access, make changes to the system that they are not authorized to make, and execute commands on an affected system with privileges of the root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3375", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 19.2.0andbefore (<) 19.2.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  up to, including, (<=) 18.3.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 18.4.0andbefore (<) 18.4.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 19.3.0andbefore (<) 20.1.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe Sd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 16.12.0andup to, including, (<=) 16.12.4cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe_sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe Sd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 17.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 17.2.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe_sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe Sd-wanVersions  up to, including, (<=) 16.9.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe_sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-26  0.86%  0.61%  -0.25 \n 2  2024-03-28  0.73%  0.86%  +0.13 \n 3  2023-06-22  0.67%  0.73%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-04-15  0.53%  0.67%  +0.14 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.53%  -0.53 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdbufof-h5f5VSeL", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN Solution Software Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
