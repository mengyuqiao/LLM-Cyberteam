{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15123", "Description": "In codecov (npm package) before version 3.7.1 the upload method has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the codecov-node library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability. A similar CVE (CVE-2020-7597 for GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh) was issued but the fix was incomplete. It only blocked &, and command injection is still possible using backticks instead to bypass the sanitizer. The attack surface is low in this case. Particularly in the standard use of codecov, where the module is used directly in a build pipeline, not built against as a library in another application that may supply malicious input and perform command injection.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15123", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCodecov\u00bbCodecov\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.7.1cpe:2.3:a:codecov:codecov:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.60%  3.26%  +1.66 \n 2  2023-07-24  1.13%  1.60%  +0.47 \n 3  2023-06-12  0.80%  1.13%  +0.33 \n 4  2023-04-05  0.73%  0.80%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-03-07  9.19%  0.73%  -8.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/codecov/codecov-node/pull/180", "ref_desc": "Switch from execSync to execFileSync by drazisil \u00b7 Pull Request #180 \u00b7 codecov/codecov-node \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codecov/codecov-node/commit/c0711c656686e902af2cd92d6aecc8074de4d83d", "ref_desc": "Switch from execSync to execFileSync (#180) \u00b7 codecov/codecov-node@c0711c6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh", "ref_desc": "codecov NPM module allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands \u00b7 CVE-2020-7597 \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lgtm.com/query/7714424068617023832", "ref_desc": "Query console - LGTMExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codecov/codecov-node/security/advisories/GHSA-xp63-6vf5-xf3v", "ref_desc": "Command injection in upload method \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codecov/codecov-node \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
