{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11081", "Description": "osquery before version 4.4.0 enables a privilege escalation vulnerability. If a Window system is configured with a PATH that contains a user-writable directory then a local user may write a zlib1.dll DLL, which osquery will attempt to load. Since osquery runs with elevated privileges this enables local escalation. This is fixed in version 4.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11081", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbOsqueryVersions  before (<) 4.4.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:osquery:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 \n 2  2023-02-23  1.67%  0.95%  -0.72 \n 3  2023-01-21  0.95%  1.67%  +0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-114 Process Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/114/Process-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/osquery/osquery/security/advisories/GHSA-2xwp-8fv7-c5pm", "ref_desc": "osquery susceptible to DLL search order hijacking of zlib1.dll \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 osquery/osquery \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osquery/osquery/releases/tag/4.4.0", "ref_desc": "Release 4.4.0 \u00b7 osquery/osquery \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osquery/osquery/commit/4d4957f12a6aa0becc9d01d9f97061e1e3d809c5", "ref_desc": "Disable openssl compression support (#6433) \u00b7 osquery/osquery@4d4957f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6433", "ref_desc": "Disable openssl compression support by Smjert \u00b7 Pull Request #6433 \u00b7 osquery/osquery \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/6426", "ref_desc": "Privilege Escalation Bug in Osquery 4.2.0 (windows) via Dll Search Order Hijacking \u00b7 Issue #6426 \u00b7 osquery/osquery \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
