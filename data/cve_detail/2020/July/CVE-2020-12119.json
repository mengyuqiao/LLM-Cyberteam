{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12119", "Description": "Ledger Live before 2.7.0 does not handle Bitcoin's Replace-By-Fee (RBF). It increases the user's balance with the value of an unconfirmed transaction as soon as it is received (before the transaction is confirmed) and does not decrease the balance when it is canceled. As a result, users are exposed to basic double spending attacks, amplified double spending attacks, and DoS attacks without user consent.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12119", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLedger\u00bbLedger LiveVersions  before (<) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:ledger:ledger_live:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-18  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://donjon.ledger.com/lsb/012/", "ref_desc": "Ledger Security Bulletin 012 | DonjonPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
