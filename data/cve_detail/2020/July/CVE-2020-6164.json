{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6164", "Description": "In SilverStripe through 4.5.0, a specific URL path configured by default through the silverstripe/framework module can be used to disclose the fact that a domain is hosting a Silverstripe application. There is no disclosure of the specific version. The functionality on this URL path is limited to execution in a CLI context, and is not known to present a vulnerability through web-based access. As a side-effect, this preconfigured path also blocks the creation of other resources on this path (e.g. a page).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6164", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripeVersions  from including (>=) 4.5.0andbefore (<) 4.5.4cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripeVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.4.7cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-11  0.21%  0.30%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-10-10  0.30%  0.21%  -0.09 \n 3  2024-08-24  0.25%  0.30%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-11-18  0.18%  0.25%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-06-21  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-31  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.16%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2020-6164", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-6164 Information disclosure on /interactive URL path \u00bb SilverStripeVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
