{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10281", "Description": "This vulnerability applies to the Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol and allows a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information provided it has access to the communication medium. MAVLink is a header-based protocol that does not perform encryption to improve transfer (and reception speed) and efficiency by design. The increasing popularity of the protocol (used accross different autopilots) has led to its use in wired and wireless mediums through insecure communication channels exposing sensitive information to a remote attacker with ability to intercept network traffic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10281", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDronecode\u00bbMicro Air Vehicle Link\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:dronecode:micro_air_vehicle_link:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-12  0.35%  0.48%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-03-20  0.26%  0.35%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-07-07  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-19  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.23%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XtbD0ORNkhZ8eKrsbSIZNLyg9sFRXMXbsR2mp37KbIg/edit", "ref_desc": "Some Proposals for MAVLink 2 - Google DocumentenTechnical Description;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
