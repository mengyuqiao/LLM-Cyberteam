{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3382", "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary actions with administrative privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because different installations share a static encryption key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the static key to craft a valid session token. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3382", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbData Center Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 11.4\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:data_center_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.76% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-07  1.07%  0.76%  -0.31 \n 2  2024-04-15  1.51%  1.07%  -0.44 \n 3  2023-04-15  1.37%  1.51%  +0.14 \n 4  2023-04-02  0.97%  1.37%  +0.40 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.97%  -0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-bypass-dyEejUMs", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
