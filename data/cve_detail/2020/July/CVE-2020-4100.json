{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-4100", "Description": "\"HCL Verse for Android was found to employ dynamic code loading. This mechanism allows a developer to specify which components of the application should not be loaded by default when the application is started. Typically, core components and additional dependencies are loaded natively at runtime; however, dynamically loaded components are only loaded as they are specifically requested. While this can have a positive impact on performance, or grant additional functionality (for example, a non-invasive update feature), it can also open the application to loading unintended code if not implemented properly.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4100", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHcltechsw\u00bbHcl Verse\u00bbVersion:11.0.4ForAndroidcpe:2.3:a:hcltechsw:hcl_verse:11.0.4:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-913 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/913/Improper-Control-of-Dynamically-Managed-Code-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0080800", "ref_desc": "Security Bulletin: HCL Verse for Android was susceptible to dynamic code loading (CVE-2020-4100) - Customer SupportVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
