{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15001", "Description": "An information leak was discovered on Yubico YubiKey 5 NFC devices 5.0.0 to 5.2.6 and 5.3.0 to 5.3.1. The OTP application allows a user to set optional access codes on OTP slots. This access code is intended to prevent unauthorized changes to OTP configurations. The access code is not checked when updating NFC specific components of the OTP configurations. This may allow an attacker to access configured OTPs and passwords stored in slots that were not configured by the user to be read over NFC, despite a user having set an access code. (Users who have not set an access code, or who have not configured the OTP slots, are not impacted by this issue.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15001", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nYubico\u00bbYubikey 5 Nfc FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.2.6cpe:2.3:o:yubico:yubikey_5_nfc_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Yubico\u00bbYubikey 5 Nfc\u00bbVersion:N/A\nYubico\u00bbYubikey 5 Nfc FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 5.3.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.3.1cpe:2.3:o:yubico:yubikey_5_nfc_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Yubico\u00bbYubikey 5 Nfc\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-11-12  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-01  0.11%  0.10%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-25  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2020-04/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory 2020-07-08 | YubicoExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
