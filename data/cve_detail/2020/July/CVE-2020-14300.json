{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14300", "Description": "The docker packages version docker-1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30.el7 as released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHBA-2020:0053 (https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:0053) included an incorrect version of runc that was missing multiple bug and security fixes. One of the fixes regressed in that update was the fix for CVE-2016-9962, that was previously corrected in the docker packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHSA-2017:0116 (https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0116). The CVE-2020-14300 was assigned to this security regression and it is specific to the docker packages produced by Red Hat. The original issue - CVE-2016-9962 - could possibly allow a process inside container to compromise a process entering container namespace and execute arbitrary code outside of the container. This could lead to compromise of the container host or other containers running on the same container host. This issue only affects a single version of Docker, 1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30, shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Both earlier and later versions are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14300", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux Server\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux_server:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDocker\u00bbDocker\u00bbVersion:1.13.1cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:1.13.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.37%  0.05%  -1.31 \n 2  2023-02-13  1.61%  1.37%  -0.24 \n 3  2023-02-03  1.37%  1.61%  +0.24 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-273 Improper Check for Dropped Privileges", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/273/Improper-Check-for-Dropped-Privileges.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/cve-2016-9962", "ref_desc": "On-entry container attack - CVE-2016-9962 - Red Hat Customer PortalNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-be6eDrdrmKZ30BOspx7ZESNt5c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:0427", "ref_desc": "RHBA-2020:0427 - Bug Fix Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gpA2iL548AQuzZC32_EYVonhJ_4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-9962", "ref_desc": "1409531 \u2013 (CVE-2016-9962) CVE-2016-9962 docker: insecure opening of file-descriptor allows privilege escalationNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9962", "ref_desc": "Red Hat Customer PortalNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
