{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15892", "Description": "An issue was discovered in apply.cgi on D-Link DAP-1520 devices before 1.10b04Beta02. Whenever a user performs a login action from the web interface, the request values are being forwarded to the ssi binary. On the login page, the web interface restricts the password input field to a fixed length of 15 characters. The problem is that validation is being done on the client side, hence it can be bypassed. When an attacker manages to intercept the login request (POST based) and tampers with the vulnerable parameter (log_pass), to a larger length, the request will be forwarded to the webserver. This results in a stack-based buffer overflow. A few other POST variables, (transferred as part of the login request) are also vulnerable: html_response_page and log_user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15892", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nDlink\u00bbDap-1520 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.10b04cpe:2.3:o:dlink:dap-1520_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDap-1520\u00bbVersion:A1", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-11  0.23%  0.32%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-11-25  0.21%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-09  0.23%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-07-26  0.32%  0.23%  -0.10 \n 6  2023-06-14  0.23%  0.32%  +0.10 \n 7  2023-04-07  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-669 Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/669/Incorrect-Resource-Transfer-Between-Spheres.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://research.loginsoft.com/bugs/classic-stack-based-buffer-overflow-in-dlink-firmware-dap-1520/", "ref_desc": "1 new messageExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10169", "ref_desc": "D-Link Technical SupportPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RUIeEfMlQd1M0gDjRv7bGgle4lo.html"}]}
