{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15093", "Description": "The tough library (Rust/crates.io) prior to version 0.7.1 does not properly verify the threshold of cryptographic signatures. It allows an attacker to duplicate a valid signature in order to circumvent TUF requiring a minimum threshold of unique signatures before the metadata is considered valid. A fix is available in version 0.7.1. CVE-2020-6174 is assigned to the same vulnerability in the TUF reference implementation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15093", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbTough\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.7.1cpe:2.3:a:amazon:tough:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-05-13  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-25  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/awslabs/tough/security/advisories/GHSA-5q2r-92f9-4m49", "ref_desc": "Improper uniqueness verification of signature threshold \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 awslabs/tough \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://crates.io/crates/tough", "ref_desc": "tough - crates.io: Rust Package RegistryThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/commit/2977188139d065ff3356c3cb4aec60c582b57e0e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #974 from lukpueh/fix-signature-threshold \u00b7 theupdateframework/tuf@2977188 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/pull/974", "ref_desc": "Fix signature threshold by lukpueh \u00b7 Pull Request #974 \u00b7 theupdateframework/tuf \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XsxnVHZEZhYxq1hgd6MHmxibtjE.html"}]}
