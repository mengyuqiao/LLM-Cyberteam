{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15086", "Description": "In TYPO3 installations with the \"mediace\" extension from version 7.6.2 and before version 7.6.5, it has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. The allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code and can lead to remote code execution. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to at least one `Extbase` plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation. This is fixed in version 7.6.5 of the \"mediace\" extension for TYPO3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15086", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbMediace\u00bbForTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 7.6.2andbefore (<) 7.6.5cpe:2.3:a:typo3:mediace:*:*:*:*:*:typo3:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "5.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  11.51%  5.36%  -6.15 \n 2  2024-01-19  8.47%  11.51%  +3.04 \n 3  2023-12-17  8.47%  8.47%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-02  7.14%  8.47%  +1.33 \n 5  2023-10-01  5.17%  7.14%  +1.97 \n 6  2023-09-01  3.72%  5.17%  +1.45 \n 7  2023-08-16  2.66%  3.72%  +1.06 \n 8  2023-07-05  2.52%  2.66%  +0.14 \n 9  2023-04-14  2.36%  2.52%  +0.16 \n 10  2023-03-07  5.63%  2.36%  -3.27 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-325 Missing Cryptographic Step", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/325/Missing-Cryptographic-Step.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/mediace/security/advisories/GHSA-4h44-w6fm-548g", "ref_desc": "Sensitive Information Disclosure in extension \"Media Content Element\" (mediace) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FriendsOfTYPO3/mediace \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/mediace/pull/31", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Restrict file validation hash generation by ohader \u00b7 Pull Request #31 \u00b7 FriendsOfTYPO3/mediace \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/mediace/commit/fa29ffd3e8b275782a8600d2406e1b1e5e16ae75", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Restrict file validation hash generation \u00b7 FriendsOfTYPO3/mediace@fa29ffd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
