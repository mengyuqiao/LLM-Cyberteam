{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15099", "Description": "In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20, and greater than or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, in a case where an attacker manages to generate a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) - either by using a different existing vulnerability or in case the internal encryptionKey was exposed - it is possible to retrieve arbitrary files of a TYPO3 installation. This includes the possibility to fetch typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php, which again contains the encryptionKey as well as credentials of the database management system being used. In case a database server is directly accessible either via internet or in a shared hosting network, this allows the ability to completely retrieve, manipulate or delete database contents. This includes creating an administration user account - which can be used to trigger remote code execution by injecting custom extensions. This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15099", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.6cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.20cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.94% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-15  0.69%  0.94%  +0.25 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.49%  0.69%  +0.21 \n 3  2023-07-05  0.46%  0.49%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-04-14  0.43%  0.46%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.43%  -1.55 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-007: Potential Privilege EscalationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-3x94-fv5h-5q2c", "ref_desc": "Potential Privilege Escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
