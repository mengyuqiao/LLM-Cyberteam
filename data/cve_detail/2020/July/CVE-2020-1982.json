{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1982", "Description": "Certain communication between PAN-OS and cloud-delivered services inadvertently use TLS 1.0, which is known to be a cryptographically weak protocol. These cloud services include Cortex Data Lake, the Customer Support Portal, and the Prisma Access infrastructure. Conditions required for exploitation of known TLS 1.0 weaknesses do not exist for the communication between PAN-OS and cloud-delivered services. We do not believe that any communication is impacted as a result of known attacks against TLS 1.0. This issue impacts: All versions of PAN-OS 8.0; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.14; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3. PAN-OS 7.1 is not impacted by this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1982", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.0.20cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.0andbefore (<) 9.1.3cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.0.9cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 8.1.0andbefore (<) 8.1.14cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-08  0.08%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-24  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-1982", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-1982 PAN-OS: TLS 1.0 usage for certain communications with Palo Alto Networks cloud delivered servicesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
