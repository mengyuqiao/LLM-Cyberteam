{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10927", "Description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the encryption of firmware update images. The issue results from the use of an inappropriate encryption algorithm. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of root.
