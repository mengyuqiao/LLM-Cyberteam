{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10923", "Description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the UPnP service, which listens on TCP port 5000. A crafted UPnP message can be used to bypass authentication. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
