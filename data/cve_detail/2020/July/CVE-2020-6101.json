{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6101", "Description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the Shader functionality of AMD Radeon DirectX 11 Driver atidxx64.dll 26.20.15019.19000. An attacker can provide a specially crafted shader file to trigger this vulnerability, resulting in code execution. This vulnerability can be triggered from a HYPER-V guest using the RemoteFX feature, leading to executing the vulnerable code on the HYPER-V host (inside of the rdvgm.exe process). Theoretically this vulnerability could be also triggered from web browser (using webGL and webassembly).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6101", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nAMD\u00bbRadeon Directx 11 Driver Atidxx64.dll\u00bbVersion:26.20.15019.19000cpe:2.3:a:amd:radeon_directx_11_driver_atidxx64.dll:26.20.15019.19000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.20%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-11-23  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-12  0.11%  0.10%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.11%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1041", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2020-1041 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
