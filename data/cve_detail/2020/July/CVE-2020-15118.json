{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15118", "Description": "In Wagtail before versions 2.7.4 and 2.9.3, when a form page type is made available to Wagtail editors through the `wagtail.contrib.forms` app, and the page template is built using Django's standard form rendering helpers such as form.as_p, any HTML tags used within a form field's help text will be rendered unescaped in the page. Allowing HTML within help text is an intentional design decision by Django; however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality should therefore not have been made available to editor-level users. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.4 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.9.3 (for the current 2.9 branch). In these versions, help text will be escaped to prevent the inclusion of HTML tags. Site owners who wish to re-enable the use of HTML within help text (and are willing to accept the risk of this being exploited by editors) may set WAGTAILFORMS_HELP_TEXT_ALLOW_HTML = True in their configuration settings. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can secure their form page templates by rendering forms field-by-field as per Django's documentation, but omitting the |safe filter when outputting the help text.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15118", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 2.7andbefore (<) 2.7.4cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 2.9andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-2473-9hgq-j7xw", "ref_desc": "HTML injection through form field help text \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/master/docs/releases/2.9.3.rst", "ref_desc": "wagtail/2.9.3.rst at master \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.help_text", "ref_desc": "Model field reference | Django documentation | DjangoThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/d9a41e7f24d08c024acc9a3094940199df94db34", "ref_desc": "Escape help text in form builder forms by default \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@d9a41e7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/contrib/forms/index.html#usage", "ref_desc": "Form builder \u2014 Wagtail 2.9.3 documentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
