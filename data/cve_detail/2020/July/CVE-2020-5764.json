{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5764", "Description": "MX Player Android App versions prior to v1.24.5, are vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when user is using the MX Transfer feature in \"Receive\" mode. An attacker can exploit this by connecting to the MX Transfer session as a \"sender\" and sending a MessageType of \"FILE_LIST\" with a \"name\" field containing directory traversal characters (../). This will result in the file being transferred to the victim's phone, but being saved outside of the intended \"/sdcard/MXshare\" directory. In some instances, an attacker can achieve remote code execution by writing \".odex\" and \".vdex\" files in the \"oat\" directory of the MX Player application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5764", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMxplayer\u00bbMx Player\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 1.24.5cpe:2.3:a:mxplayer:mx_player:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.21%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-08-17  0.18%  0.25%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-04-27  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-25  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-06-14  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-24  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.13%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2020-41", "ref_desc": "MX Player Android App Directory Traversal - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TWB-V3Z5UBdZlYzB60RmJA9gBmE.html"}]}
