{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15565", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of insufficient cache write-back under VT-d. When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to them require flushing of both TLBs. Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent, and hence prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs, a CPU cache also needs writing back to memory after changes were made. Such writing back of cached data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings into smaller granularity ones. A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later reused for another purpose. Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege escalation cannot be ruled out. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only x86 Intel systems are affected. x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP), having a passed through PCI device assigned, and having page table sharing enabled can leverage the vulnerability. Note that page table sharing will be enabled (by default) only if Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page size support compatible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15565", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXEN\u00bbXEN\u00bbForX86Versions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.13.1cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:31cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.2cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.05%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00024.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0965-1: important: Security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4agVOWpxRC3qvk9ICFF6lfM-2w8.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-321.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-321 - Xen Security AdvisoriesPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/07/07/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 321 v3 (CVE-2020-15565) - insufficient cache write-back under VT-dMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-02", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202007-02) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JAVbtW92RZA0jw71ndb5DpZXY6w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MXESCOVI7AVRNC7HEAMFM7PMEO6D3AUH/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: xen-4.12.3-3.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jcoZf-cPZ3eQkgzcmkJJnJcwhHc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4723", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JzlEZ9tvQ5GAT4f29vW6iqIB3hI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VB3QJJZV23Z2IDYEMIHELWYSQBUEW6JP/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: xen-4.13.1-4.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/V4yOa0e8zta8H06XibvxX5QcDz0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00031.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0985-1: important: Security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VK_nObkkYS8fpJwJAl9PE58zRok.html"}]}
