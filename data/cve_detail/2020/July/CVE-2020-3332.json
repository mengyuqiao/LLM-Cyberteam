{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3332", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands that are executed by an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands or scripts with root privileges on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3332", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv130w Wireless-n Multifunction Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.3.55cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv130w_wireless-n_multifunction_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv130w Wireless-n Multifunction Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv110w Wireless-n Vpn Firewall FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.2.2.8cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv110w_wireless-n_vpn_firewall_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv110w Wireless-n Vpn Firewall\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv215w Wireless-n Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.3.1.7cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv215w_wireless-n_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv215w Wireless-n Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv130 Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.3.55cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv130_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv130 Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.18%  -0.08 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.26%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cmd-shell-injection-9jOQn9Dy", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Series Routers Command Shell Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
