{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15350", "Description": "RIOT 2020.04 has a buffer overflow in the base64 decoder. The decoding function base64_decode() uses an output buffer estimation function to compute the required buffer capacity and validate against the provided buffer size. The base64_estimate_decode_size() function calculates the expected decoded size with an arithmetic round-off error and does not take into account possible padding bytes. Due to this underestimation, it may be possible to craft base64 input that causes a buffer overflow.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15350", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nRiot-os\u00bbRiot\u00bbVersion:2020.04cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:2020.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-23  0.18%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/131/Incorrect-Calculation-of-Buffer-Size.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/14400", "ref_desc": "sys/base64: Fix, unit test cleanup, and benchmark by maribu \u00b7 Pull Request #14400 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jMCAi8uawV1-an5uCghIxT2TEdxCE1Lk/view?usp=sharing", "ref_desc": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jMCAi8uawV1-an5uCghIxT2TEdxCE1Lk/view?usp=sharingMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
