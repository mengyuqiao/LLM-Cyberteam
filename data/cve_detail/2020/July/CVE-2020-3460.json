{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3460", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a request from a user and injecting malicious data into an HTTP header. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3460", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbData Center Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 11.4\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:data_center_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-03  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-04-15  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-xss-3jkDLsLV", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
