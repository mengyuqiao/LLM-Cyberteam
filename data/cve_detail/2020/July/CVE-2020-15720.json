{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15720", "Description": "In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not enable python-requests certificate validation. Since the verify parameter was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15720", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDogtagpki\u00bbDogtagpkiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 10.8.3cpe:2.3:a:dogtagpki:dogtagpki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.11%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-05-18  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 3  2024-05-03  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-30  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/50c23ec146ee9abf28c9de87a5f7787d495f0b72", "ref_desc": "Enable certificate verification in PKIConnection \u00b7 dogtagpki/pki@50c23ec \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/compare/v10.9.0-a2...v10.9.0-b1", "ref_desc": "Comparing v10.9.0-a2...v10.9.0-b1 \u00b7 dogtagpki/pki \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1855273", "ref_desc": "1855273 \u2013 pki: dogtag's Python client does not validate certificateIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
