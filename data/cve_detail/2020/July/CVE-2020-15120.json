{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15120", "Description": "In \"I hate money\" before version 4.1.5, an authenticated member of one project can modify and delete members of another project, without knowledge of this other project's private code. This can be further exploited to access all bills of another project without knowledge of this other project's private code. With the default configuration, anybody is allowed to create a new project. An attacker can create a new project and then use it to become authenticated and exploit this flaw. As such, the exposure is similar to an unauthenticated attack, because it is trivial to become authenticated. This is fixed in version 4.1.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15120", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIhatemoney\u00bbI Hate MoneyVersions  before (<) 4.1.5cpe:2.3:a:ihatemoney:i_hate_money:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/security/advisories/GHSA-67j9-c52g-w2q9", "ref_desc": "Project data can be accessed and modified from another project without authorization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 spiral-project/ihatemoney \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/commit/8d77cf5d5646e1d2d8ded13f0660638f57e98471", "ref_desc": "Fix unauthorized access and modification of project data (CVE-2020-15\u2026 \u00b7 spiral-project/ihatemoney@8d77cf5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
