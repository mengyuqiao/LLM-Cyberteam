{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15091", "Description": "TenderMint from version 0.33.0 and before version 0.33.6 allows block proposers to include signatures for the wrong block. This may happen naturally if you start a network, have it run for some time and restart it (**without changing chainID**). A malicious block proposer (even with a minimal amount of stake) can use this vulnerability to completely halt the network. This issue is fixed in Tendermint 0.33.6 which checks all the signatures are for the block with 2/3+ majority before creating a commit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15091", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTendermint\u00bbTendermintVersions  from including (>=) 0.33.0andbefore (<) 0.33.6cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-19  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/security/advisories/GHSA-6jqj-f58p-mrw3", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory Syringa \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tendermint/tendermint \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/4926", "ref_desc": "Consensus: \"enterPrevote: ProposalBlock is invalid\" - Error: \"wrong signature\" \u00b7 Issue #4926 \u00b7 tendermint/tendermint \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/commit/480b995a31727593f58b361af979054d17d84340", "ref_desc": "consensus: Do not allow signatures for a wrong block in commits \u00b7 tendermint/tendermint@480b995 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
