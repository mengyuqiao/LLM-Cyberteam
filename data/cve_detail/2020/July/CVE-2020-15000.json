{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15000", "Description": "A PIN management problem was discovered on Yubico YubiKey 5 devices 5.2.0 to 5.2.6. OpenPGP has three passwords: Admin PIN, Reset Code, and User PIN. The Reset Code is used to reset the User PIN, but it is disabled by default. A flaw in the implementation of OpenPGP sets the Reset Code to a known value upon initialization. If the retry counter for the Reset Code is set to non-zero without changing the Reset Code, this known value can be used to reset the User PIN. To set the retry counters, the Admin PIN is required.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15000", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nYubico\u00bbYubikey 5 Nfc FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 5.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.2.6cpe:2.3:o:yubico:yubikey_5_nfc_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Yubico\u00bbYubikey 5 Nfc\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-25  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2020-05/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory 2020-07-08 | YubicoMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
