{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15593", "Description": "SteelCentral Aternity Agent 11.0.0.120 on Windows mishandles IPC. It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. Any user in the system is allowed to access the interprocess communication channel AternityAgentAssistantIpc, retrieve a serialized object and call object methods remotely. Among others, the methods allow any user to: (1) Create and/or overwrite arbitrary XML files across the system; (2) Create arbitrary directories across the system; and (3) Load arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins\u201d directory and execute code contained in them.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15593", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nRiverbed\u00bbSteelcentral Aternity Agent\u00bbVersion:11.0.0.120cpe:2.3:a:riverbed:steelcentral_aternity_agent:11.0.0.120:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.04%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://aternity.force.com/customersuccess/s/article/Recorder-tool-security-notification-mitigation-steps-for-On-Prem", "ref_desc": "Login | Aternity Customer SuccessPermissions Required;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SsjAh0HSRWwowddaeVQix9Wz4rM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-steelcentral-aternity-agent-cve-2020-15592-cve-2020-15593/", "ref_desc": "Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in SteelCentral Aternity Agent \u2013 SEC ConsultThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vwOCw3A3Jv44LOvAPZNZCXxVGEw.html"}]}
