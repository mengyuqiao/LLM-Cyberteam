{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5414", "Description": "VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.19, 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.13, and 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7) contains an App Autoscaler that logs the UAA admin password. This credential is redacted on VMware Tanzu Operations Manager; however, the unredacted logs are available to authenticated users of the BOSH Director. This credential would grant administrative privileges to a malicious user. The same versions of App Autoscaler also log the App Autoscaler Broker password. Prior to newer versions of Operations Manager, this credential was not redacted from logs. This credential allows a malicious user to create, delete, and modify App Autoscaler services instances. Operations Manager started redacting this credential from logs as of its versions 2.7.15, 2.8.6, and 2.9.1. Note that these logs are typically only visible to foundation administrators and operators.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5414", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbTanzu Application Service For Virtual MachinesVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andbefore (<) 2.7.19cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbTanzu Application Service For Virtual MachinesVersions  from including (>=) 2.8.0andbefore (<) 2.8.13cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbTanzu Application Service For Virtual MachinesVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.7cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbOperations ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andbefore (<) 2.7.15cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbOperations ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 2.8.0andbefore (<) 2.8.6cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbOperations ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.1cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2020-5414", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-5414: App Autoscaler logs credentials | Security | VMware TanzuVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
