{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7692", "Description": "PKCE support is not implemented in accordance with the RFC for OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps. Without the use of PKCE, the authorization code returned by an authorization server is not enough to guarantee that the client that issued the initial authorization request is the one that will be authorized. An attacker is able to obtain the authorization code using a malicious app on the client-side and use it to gain authorization to the protected resource. This affects the package com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client before 1.31.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7692", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbOauth Client Library For JavaVersions  before (<) 1.31.0cpe:2.3:a:google:oauth_client_library_for_java:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.93%  0.66%  -0.27 \n 2  2024-11-02  0.67%  0.93%  +0.26 \n 3  2024-06-15  0.58%  0.67%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-05-30  0.43%  0.58%  +0.16 \n 5  2024-03-26  0.37%  0.43%  +0.06 \n 6  2024-02-21  0.43%  0.37%  -0.06 \n 7  2023-11-08  0.23%  0.43%  +0.20 \n 8  2023-03-25  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.24%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r3db6ac73e0558d64f0b664f2fa4ef0a865e57c5de20f8321d3b48678@%3Ccommits.druid.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[GitHub] [druid] suneet-s opened a new pull request #10214: Suppress CVE-2020-7692 - Pony MailMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636%23section-1", "ref_desc": "RFC 7636 - Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public ClientsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client/issues/469", "ref_desc": "PKCE support? \u00b7 Issue #469 \u00b7 googleapis/google-oauth-java-client \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252%23section-8.1", "ref_desc": "RFC 8252 - OAuth 2.0 for Native AppsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client/commit/13433cd7dd06267fc261f0b1d4764f8e3432c824", "ref_desc": "feat: add PKCE support to AuthorizationCodeFlow (#470) \u00b7 googleapis/google-oauth-java-client@13433cd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMGOOGLEOAUTHCLIENT-575276", "ref_desc": "Improper Authorization in com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/reae8909b264d1103f321b9ce1623c10c1ddc77dba9790247f2c0c90f@%3Ccommits.druid.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[druid] branch master updated: Suppress CVE-2020-7692 (#10214) - Pony MailMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
