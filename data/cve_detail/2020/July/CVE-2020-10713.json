{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10713", "Description": "A flaw was found in grub2, prior to version 2.06. An attacker may use the GRUB 2 flaw to hijack and tamper the GRUB verification process. This flaw also allows the bypass of Secure Boot protections. In order to load an untrusted or modified kernel, an attacker would first need to establish access to the system such as gaining physical access, obtain the ability to alter a pxe-boot network, or have remote access to a networked system with root access. With this access, an attacker could then craft a string to cause a buffer overflow by injecting a malicious payload that leads to arbitrary code execution within GRUB. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10713", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGNU\u00bbGrub2Versions  before (<) 2.06cpe:2.3:a:gnu:grub2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbPhoton OsVersions  before (<) 2.0cpe:2.3:o:vmware:photon_os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.2cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.31%  +0.24 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.86%  0.07%  -1.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cve.openeuler.org/#/CVEInfo/CVE-2020-10713", "ref_desc": "openEulerBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/07/29/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - multiple secure boot grub2 and linux kernel vulnerabilitiesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DLfQFOIUyUpf9LRsQ5Wd9W3hnfA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1825243", "ref_desc": "1825243 \u2013 (CVE-2020-10713) CVE-2020-10713 grub2: Crafted grub.cfg file can lead to arbitrary code execution during boot processIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4735", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4735-1 grub2Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EpM42ql7M1zgWGYgHcU16MFzNJQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00016.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1168-1: important: Security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ghDr0Vjpsa4MqaWWK51BLVHzsWc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-grub2-code-exec-xLePCAPY", "ref_desc": "GRUB2 Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/80181", "ref_desc": "VMware response to GRUB2 security vulnerability CVE-2020-10713Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202104-05", "ref_desc": "GRUB: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202104-05) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Mk_xwHUYBKC_nj5gY9Y4NWjdcts.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://eclypsium.com/2020/07/29/theres-a-hole-in-the-boot/", "ref_desc": "There\u2019s a Hole in the Boot - EclypsiumTechnical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200731-0008/", "ref_desc": "July 2020 Grub2 Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/P2bAwNMKNB55IMfRtFtrYBwCWA4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00017.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1169-1: important: Security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WAcW0uYG3mjiYLeotrNmoOkScT4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4432-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-4432-1: GRUB 2 vulnerabilities | Ubuntu security notices | UbuntuThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/x3NcVweOdMBpLuEkVlP-0rZH7pU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/174059", "ref_desc": "VU#174059 - GRUB2 bootloader is vulnerable to buffer overflowThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
