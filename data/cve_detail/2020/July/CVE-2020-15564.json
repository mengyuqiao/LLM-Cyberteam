{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15564", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Arm guest OS users to cause a hypervisor crash because of a missing alignment check in VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info. The hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info is used by a guest to register a shared region with the hypervisor. The region will be mapped into Xen address space so it can be directly accessed. On Arm, the region is accessed with instructions that require a specific alignment. Unfortunately, there is no check that the address provided by the guest will be correctly aligned. As a result, a malicious guest could cause a hypervisor crash by passing a misaligned address. A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). All Xen versions are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15564", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXEN\u00bbXEN\u00bbForARMVersions  from including (>=) 4.8.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.13.1cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:arm:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:31cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.05%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/07/07/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 327 v3 (CVE-2020-15564) - Missing alignment check in VCPUOP_register_vcpu_infoMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-02", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202007-02) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JAVbtW92RZA0jw71ndb5DpZXY6w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MXESCOVI7AVRNC7HEAMFM7PMEO6D3AUH/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: xen-4.12.3-3.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jcoZf-cPZ3eQkgzcmkJJnJcwhHc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4723", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JzlEZ9tvQ5GAT4f29vW6iqIB3hI.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-327.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-327 - Xen Security AdvisoriesPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VB3QJJZV23Z2IDYEMIHELWYSQBUEW6JP/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: xen-4.13.1-4.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/V4yOa0e8zta8H06XibvxX5QcDz0.html"}]}
