{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3340", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need valid administrative credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3340", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services EngineVersions  before (<) 2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.6.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdatePatch1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.6.0:patch1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdatePatch2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.6.0:patch2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdatePatch3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.6.0:patch3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdatePatch5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.6.0:patch5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdatePatch6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.6.0:patch6:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-mlt-ise-strd-xss-nqFhTtx7", "ref_desc": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilitiesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
