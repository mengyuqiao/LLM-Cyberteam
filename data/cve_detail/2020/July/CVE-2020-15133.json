{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15133", "Description": "In faye-websocket before version 0.11.0, there is a lack of certification validation in TLS handshakes. The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses the `EM::Connection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the TLS handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This method does not implement certificate verification by default, meaning that it does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificate for the expected hostname. That means that any `wss:` connection made using this library is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, since it does not confirm the identity of the server it is connected to. For further background information on this issue, please see the referenced GitHub Advisory. Upgrading `faye-websocket` to v0.11.0 is recommended.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15133", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFaye-websocket Project\u00bbFaye-websocketVersions  before (<) 0.11.0cpe:2.3:a:faye-websocket_project:faye-websocket:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-04-17  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-03-14  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-12-04  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-04-16  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-ruby/security/advisories/GHSA-2v5c-755p-p4gv", "ref_desc": "Missing TLS certificate verification \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 faye/faye-websocket-ruby \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.jcoglan.com/2020/07/31/missing-tls-verification-in-faye/", "ref_desc": "Missing TLS certificate verification in Faye \u2013 The If WorksExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/twm79N4ol-hPKD4ODK8K5QTb74Y.html"}]}
