{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15104", "Description": "In Envoy before versions 1.12.6, 1.13.4, 1.14.4, and 1.15.0 when validating TLS certificates, Envoy would incorrectly allow a wildcard DNS Subject Alternative Name apply to multiple subdomains. For example, with a SAN of *.example.com, Envoy would incorrectly allow nested.subdomain.example.com, when it should only allow subdomain.example.com. This defect applies to both validating a client TLS certificate in mTLS, and validating a server TLS certificate for upstream connections. This vulnerability is only applicable to situations where an untrusted entity can obtain a signed wildcard TLS certificate for a domain of which you only intend to trust a subdomain of. For example, if you intend to trust api.mysubdomain.example.com, and an untrusted actor can obtain a signed TLS certificate for *.example.com or *.com. Configurations are vulnerable if they use verify_subject_alt_name in any Envoy version, or if they use match_subject_alt_names in version 1.14 or later. This issue has been fixed in Envoy versions 1.12.6, 1.13.4, 1.14.4, 1.15.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15104", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.12.6cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.14.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-w5f5-6qhq-hhrg", "ref_desc": "TLS cert wildcard \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
