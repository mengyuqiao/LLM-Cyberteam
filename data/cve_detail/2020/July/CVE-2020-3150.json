{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3150", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W and RV215W Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download sensitive information from the device, which could include the device configuration. The vulnerability is due to improper authorization of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a specific URI on the web-based management interface of the router, but only after any valid user has opened a specific file on the device since the last reboot. A successful exploit would allow the attacker to view sensitive information, which should be restricted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3150", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv110w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.2.2.8cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv110w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv110w\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv215w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.3.1.7cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv215w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv215w\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-20  0.21%  0.29%  +0.09 \n 2  2023-04-01  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.19%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-info-dis-FEWBWgsD", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV110W and RV215W Series Routers Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
