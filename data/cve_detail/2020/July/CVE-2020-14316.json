{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14316", "Description": "A flaw was found in kubevirt 0.29 and earlier. Virtual Machine Instances (VMIs) can be used to gain access to the host's filesystem. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to assume the privileges of the VM process on the host system. In worst-case scenarios an attacker can read and modify any file on the system where the VMI is running. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14316", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Virtualization\u00bbVersion:1cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_virtualization:1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKubevirt\u00bbKubevirt\u00bbForKubernetesVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.29cpe:2.3:a:kubevirt:kubevirt:*:*:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1848951", "ref_desc": "1848951 \u2013 (CVE-2020-14316) CVE-2020-14316 kubevirt: VMIs can be used to access host filesIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
