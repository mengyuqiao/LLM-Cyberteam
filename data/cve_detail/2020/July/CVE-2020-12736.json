{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12736", "Description": "Code42 environments with on-premises server versions 7.0.4 and earlier allow for possible remote code execution. When an administrator creates a local (non-SSO) user via a Code42-generated email, the administrator has the option to modify content for the email invitation. If the administrator entered template language code in the subject line, that code could be interpreted by the email generation services, potentially resulting in server-side code injection.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12736", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCode42\u00bbCode42\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.0.4cpe:2.3:a:code42:code42:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-08  0.21%  0.30%  +0.09 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.21%  -1.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.code42.com/Release_Notes", "ref_desc": "Release notes - Code42 SupportRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://code42.com/r/support/CVE-2020-12736", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution on Code42 servers - Code42 SupportVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
