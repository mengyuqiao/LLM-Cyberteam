{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-9309", "Description": "Silverstripe CMS through 4.5 can be susceptible to script execution from malicious upload contents under allowed file extensions (for example HTML code in a TXT file). When these files are stored as protected or draft files, the MIME detection can cause browsers to execute the file contents. Uploads stored as protected or draft files are allowed by default for authorised users only, but can also be enabled through custom logic as well as modules such as silverstripe/userforms. Sites using the previously optional silverstripe/mimevalidator module can configure MIME whitelists rather than extension whitelists, and hence prevent this issue. Sites on the Common Web Platform (CWP) use this module by default, and are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9309", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSilverstripe\u00bbMimevalidatorVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:mimevalidator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbRecipeVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.6.0cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:recipe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-31  0.20%  0.18%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.20%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2020-9309", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-9309 Script execution on protected files with MIME spoofing content \u00bb SilverStripeVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
