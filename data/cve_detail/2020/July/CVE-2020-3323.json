{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3323", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3323", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv130w Wireless-n Multifunction Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.3.54cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv130w_wireless-n_multifunction_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv130w Wireless-n Multifunction Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv110w Wireless-n Vpn Firewall FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.2.2.8cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv110w_wireless-n_vpn_firewall_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv110w Wireless-n Vpn Firewall\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv215w Wireless-n Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.3.1.7cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv215w_wireless-n_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv215w Wireless-n Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv130 Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.3.54cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv130_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv130 Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-04  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-04-01  0.17%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-09-02  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 4  2023-06-08  0.24%  0.17%  -0.07 \n 5  2023-04-15  0.28%  0.24%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-04-01  0.22%  0.28%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.22%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-rce-AQKREqp", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Management Interface Remote Command Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
