{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-4042", "Description": "Bareos before version 19.2.8 and earlier allows a malicious client to communicate with the director without knowledge of the shared secret if the director allows client initiated connection and connects to the client itself. The malicious client can replay the Bareos director's cram-md5 challenge to the director itself leading to the director responding to the replayed challenge. The response obtained is then a valid reply to the directors original challenge. This is fixed in version 19.2.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4042", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBareos\u00bbBareosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 19.2.7cpe:2.3:a:bareos:bareos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBareos\u00bbBareos\u00bbVersion:19.2.8UpdatePREcpe:2.3:a:bareos:bareos:19.2.8:pre:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-26  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.bareos.org/view.php?id=1250", "ref_desc": "0001250: Authentication bypass in Director when allowing client and director initiated connections - Bareos Bug TrackerVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bareos/bareos/security/advisories/GHSA-vqpj-2vhj-h752", "ref_desc": "Authentication bypass in director when allowing client and director initiated connections \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bareos/bareos \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
