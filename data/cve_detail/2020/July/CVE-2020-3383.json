{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3383", "Description": "A vulnerability in the archive utility of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of paths that are embedded within archive files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files in the system with the privileges of the logged-in user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3383", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbData Center Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 11.4\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:data_center_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-26  0.39%  0.38%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-18  0.45%  0.39%  -0.06 \n 3  2024-04-15  0.33%  0.45%  +0.12 \n 4  2023-11-01  0.33%  0.33%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.33%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-path-trav-2xZOnJdR", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager Path Traversal VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
