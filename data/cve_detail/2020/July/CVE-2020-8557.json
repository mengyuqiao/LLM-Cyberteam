{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8557", "Description": "The Kubernetes kubelet component in versions 1.1-1.16.12, 1.17.0-1.17.8 and 1.18.0-1.18.5 do not account for disk usage by a pod which writes to its own /etc/hosts file. The /etc/hosts file mounted in a pod by kubelet is not included by the kubelet eviction manager when calculating ephemeral storage usage by a pod. If a pod writes a large amount of data to the /etc/hosts file, it could fill the storage space of the node and cause the node to fail.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8557", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKubernetes\u00bbKubernetesVersions  before (<) 1.16.13cpe:2.3:a:kubernetes:kubernetes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKubernetes\u00bbKubernetesVersions  from including (>=) 1.18.0andbefore (<) 1.18.6cpe:2.3:a:kubernetes:kubernetes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKubernetes\u00bbKubernetesVersions  from including (>=) 1.17.0andbefore (<) 1.17.9cpe:2.3:a:kubernetes:kubernetes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/93032", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-8557: Node disk DOS by writing to container /etc/hosts \u00b7 Issue #93032 \u00b7 kubernetes/kubernetes \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200821-0002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-8557 Kubernetes Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/cB_JUsYEKyY/m/vVSO61AhBwAJ", "ref_desc": "Inloggen - Google AccountsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
