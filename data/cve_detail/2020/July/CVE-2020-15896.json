{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15896", "Description": "An authentication-bypass issue was discovered on D-Link DAP-1522 devices 1.4x before 1.10b04Beta02. There exist a few pages that are directly accessible by any unauthorized user, e.g., logout.php and login.php. This occurs because of checking the value of NO_NEED_AUTH. If the value of NO_NEED_AUTH is 1, the user has direct access to the webpage without any authentication. By appending a query string NO_NEED_AUTH with the value of 1 to any protected URL, any unauthorized user can access the application directly, as demonstrated by bsc_lan.php?NO_NEED_AUTH=1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15896", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDlink\u00bbDap-1522 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.41cpe:2.3:o:dlink:dap-1522_firmware:1.41:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDap-1522\u00bbVersion:A1\nDlink\u00bbDap-1522 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.42cpe:2.3:o:dlink:dap-1522_firmware:1.42:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDap-1522\u00bbVersion:A1", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.14%  -0.08 \n 2  2023-04-07  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.20%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://research.loginsoft.com/bugs/authentication-bypass-in-d-link-firmware-dap-1522/", "ref_desc": "1 new messageThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10169", "ref_desc": "D-Link Technical SupportPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RUIeEfMlQd1M0gDjRv7bGgle4lo.html"}]}
