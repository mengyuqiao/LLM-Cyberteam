{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3197", "Description": "A vulnerability in the API subsystem of Cisco Meetings App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retain and reuse the Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) server credentials that are configured in an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection mechanisms for the TURN server credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting the legitimate traffic that is generated by an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the TURN server credentials, which the attacker could use to place audio/video calls and forward packets through the configured TURN server. The attacker would not be able to take control of the TURN server unless the same credentials were used in multiple systems.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3197", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbMeeting Servercpe:2.3:a:cisco:meeting_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-20  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-04-01  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cma-turn-crdls-RHjSzKXn", "ref_desc": "Cisco Meetings App Missing TURN Server Credentials Expiration VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
