{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3391", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text. The vulnerability is due to insecure storage of certain unencrypted credentials on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by viewing the network device configuration and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to discover and manage network devices.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3391", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbDigital Network Architecture CenterVersions  before (<) 1.2.10cpe:2.3:a:cisco:digital_network_architecture_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-10  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-03-18  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dnac-info-disc-6xsCyDYy", "ref_desc": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
