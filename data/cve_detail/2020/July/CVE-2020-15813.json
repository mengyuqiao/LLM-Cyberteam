{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15813", "Description": "Graylog before 3.3.3 lacks SSL Certificate Validation for LDAP servers. It allows use of an external user/group database stored in LDAP. The connection configuration allows the usage of unencrypted, SSL- or TLS-secured connections. Unfortunately, the Graylog client code (in all versions that support LDAP) does not implement proper certificate validation (regardless of whether the \"Allow self-signed certificates\" option is used). Therefore, any attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic between a Graylog server and an LDAP server is able to redirect traffic to a different LDAP server (unnoticed by the Graylog server due to the lack of certificate validation), effectively bypassing Graylog's authentication mechanism.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15813", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGraylog\u00bbGraylogVersions  before (<) 3.3.3cpe:2.3:a:graylog:graylog:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-04-16  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-04-02  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/issues/5906", "ref_desc": "LDAP connector does not verify TLS certificates \u00b7 Issue #5906 \u00b7 Graylog2/graylog2-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
