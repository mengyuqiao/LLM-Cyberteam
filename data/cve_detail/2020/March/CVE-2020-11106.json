{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11106", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Responsive Filemanager through 9.14.0. In the dialog.php page, the session variable $_SESSION['RF'][\"view_type\"] wasn't sanitized if it was already set. This made stored XSS possible if one opens ajax_calls.php and uses the \"view\" action and places a payload in the type parameter, and then returns to the dialog.php page. This occurs because ajax_calls.php was also able to set the $_SESSION['RF'][\"view_type\"] variable, but there it wasn't sanitized.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11106", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTecrail\u00bbResponsive FilemanagerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.14.0cpe:2.3:a:tecrail:responsive_filemanager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/issues/603", "ref_desc": "Stored xss in v9.14.0 in dialog.php in $_SESSION['RF'][\"view_type\"] because of no validation if ajax_calls.php setted this session. \u00b7 Issue #603 \u00b7 trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
