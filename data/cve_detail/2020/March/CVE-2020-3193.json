{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3193", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information about an affected device. The vulnerability exists because replies from the web-based management interface include unnecessary server information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inspecting replies received from the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain details about the operating system, including the web server version that is running on the device, which could be used to perform further attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3193", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime Collaboration ProvisioningVersions  before (<) 12.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_collaboration_provisioning:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbPrime Collaboration Provisioning\u00bbVersion:12.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_collaboration_provisioning:12.6:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbPrime Collaboration Provisioning\u00bbVersion:12.6UpdateService Update1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_collaboration_provisioning:12.6:service_update1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-08  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-prim-collab-disclo-FAnX4DKB", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
