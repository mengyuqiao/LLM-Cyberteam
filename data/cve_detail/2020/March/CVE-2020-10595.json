{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10595", "Description": "pam-krb5 before 4.9 has a buffer overflow that might cause remote code execution in situations involving supplemental prompting by a Kerberos library. It may overflow a buffer provided by the underlying Kerberos library by a single '\\0' byte if an attacker responds to a prompt with an answer of a carefully chosen length. The effect may range from heap corruption to stack corruption depending on the structure of the underlying Kerberos library, with unknown effects but possibly including code execution. This code path is not used for normal authentication, but only when the Kerberos library does supplemental prompting, such as with PKINIT or when using the non-standard no_prompt PAM configuration option.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10595", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPam-krb5 Project\u00bbPam-krb5Versions  before (<) 4.9cpe:2.3:a:pam-krb5_project:pam-krb5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.30%  4.62%  +0.32 \n 2  2024-03-07  3.79%  4.30%  +0.51 \n 3  2024-02-03  3.84%  3.79%  -0.05 \n 4  2024-01-19  3.67%  3.84%  +0.17 \n 5  2023-03-07  6.73%  3.67%  -3.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00000.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2166-1] libpam-krb5 security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rra/pam-krb5/commit/e7879e27a37119fad4faf133a9f70bdcdc75d760", "ref_desc": "Add CVE for buffer overflow security fix \u00b7 rra/pam-krb5@e7879e2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/03/31/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - pam-krb5 security advisory (4.9 and earlier)Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/pam-krb5/security/2020-03-30.html", "ref_desc": "pam-krb5 2020-03-30 Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4314-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-4314-1: pam-krb5 vulnerability | Ubuntu security notices", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4648", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4648-1 libpam-krb5Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
