{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-9423", "Description": "LogicalDoc before 8.3.3 could allow an attacker to upload arbitrary files, leading to command execution or retrieval of data from the database. LogicalDoc provides a functionality to add documents. Those documents could then be used for multiple tasks, such as version control, shared among users, applying tags, etc. This functionality could be abused by an unauthenticated attacker to upload an arbitrary file in a restricted folder. This would lead to the executions of malicious commands with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9423", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLogicaldoc\u00bbLogicaldocVersions  before (<) 8.3.3cpe:2.3:a:logicaldoc:logicaldoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.75% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.70%  1.75%  +1.04 \n 2  2024-06-13  0.71%  0.70%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-02-23  0.56%  0.71%  +0.15 \n 4  2023-07-22  0.52%  0.56%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.52%  -0.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/logicaldoc-virtual-appliance-multiple-vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "LogicalDoc Virtual Appliance Multiple VulnerabilitiesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uaLv9ONuOvzAtBP-YFCBtR9ZNCI.html"}]}
