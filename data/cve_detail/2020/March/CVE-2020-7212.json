{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7212", "Description": "The _encode_invalid_chars function in util/url.py in the urllib3 library 1.25.2 through 1.25.7 for Python allows a denial of service (CPU consumption) because of an inefficient algorithm. The percent_encodings array contains all matches of percent encodings. It is not deduplicated. For a URL of length N, the size of percent_encodings may be up to O(N). The next step (normalize existing percent-encoded bytes) also takes up to O(N) for each step, so the total time is O(N^2). If percent_encodings were deduplicated, the time to compute _encode_invalid_chars would be O(kN), where k is at most 484 ((10+6*2)^2).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7212", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPython\u00bbUrllib3Versions  from including (>=) 1.25.2andup to, including, (<=) 1.25.7cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-09  0.21%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-25  0.18%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.18%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/a74c9cfbaed9f811e7563cfc3dce894928e0221a", "ref_desc": "Percent-encode invalid characters with request target (#1586) \u00b7 urllib3/urllib3@a74c9cf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/master/CHANGES.rst", "ref_desc": "urllib3/CHANGES.rst at master \u00b7 urllib3/urllib3 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oWIMPCRpmsvc-JvGwXfd59jtx1c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/1.25.8/", "ref_desc": "urllib3 \u00b7 PyPIRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
