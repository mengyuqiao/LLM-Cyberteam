{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10196", "Description": "An XSS vulnerability in the popup-builder plugin before 3.64.1 for WordPress allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into existing popups via an unsecured ajax action in com/classes/Ajax.php. It is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to insert malicious JavaScript in several of the popup's fields by sending a request to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with the POST action parameter of sgpb_autosave and including additional data in an allPopupData parameter, including the popup's ID (which is visible in the source of the page in which the popup is inserted) and arbitrary JavaScript which will then be executed in the browsers of visitors to that page. Because the plugin functionality automatically adds script tags to data entered into these fields, this injection will typically bypass most WAF applications.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10196", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSygnoos\u00bbPopup-builder\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 3.64.1cpe:2.3:a:sygnoos:popup-builder:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/03/vulnerabilities-patched-in-popup-builder-plugin-affecting-over-100000-sites/", "ref_desc": "Vulnerabilities Patched in Popup Builder Plugin Affecting over 100,000 SitesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/D1AN-BJqofzhAou4-GShR2pYF94.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/10127", "ref_desc": "Popup Builder < 3.64.1 - Multiple IssuesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LmtK5_QhwK5oYdZgu2V_eu39lDI.html"}]}
