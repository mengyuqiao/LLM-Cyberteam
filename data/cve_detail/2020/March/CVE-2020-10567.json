{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10567", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Responsive Filemanager through 9.14.0. In the ajax_calls.php file in the save_img action in the name parameter, there is no validation of what kind of extension is sent. This makes it possible to execute PHP code if a legitimate JPEG image contains this code in the EXIF data, and the .php extension is used in the name parameter. (A potential fast patch is to disable the save_img action in the config file.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10567", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nTecrail\u00bbResponsive FilemanagerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.14.0cpe:2.3:a:tecrail:responsive_filemanager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.81% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.48%  0.81%  +0.33 \n 2  2024-02-19  0.47%  0.48%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-18  0.44%  0.47%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-08  0.49%  0.44%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.49%  -0.40 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171280/ZwiiCMS-12.2.04-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "ZwiiCMS 12.2.04 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/issues/600", "ref_desc": "remote code execution vulnerability in ajax_calls.php in save_img action because of no validation on extension name. \u00b7 Issue #600 \u00b7 trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
