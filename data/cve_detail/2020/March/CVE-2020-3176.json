{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3176", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Remote PHY Device Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with root privileges. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying certain CLI commands with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, which could result in a complete system compromise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3176", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRemote Phy 120 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 7.7cpe:2.3:o:cisco:remote_phy_120_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRemote Phy 120\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRemote Phy 220 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:cisco:remote_phy_220_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRemote Phy 220\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRemote Phy Shelf 7200 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:cisco:remote_phy_shelf_7200_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRemote Phy Shelf 7200\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rphy-cmdinject-DpEjeTgF", "ref_desc": "Cisco Remote PHY Device Software Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
