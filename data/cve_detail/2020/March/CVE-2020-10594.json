{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10594", "Description": "An issue was discovered in drf-jwt 1.15.x before 1.15.1. It allows attackers with access to a notionally invalidated token to obtain a new, working token via the refresh endpoint, because the blacklist protection mechanism is incompatible with the token-refresh feature. NOTE: drf-jwt is a fork of jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt, which is unmaintained.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10594", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nStyria\u00bbDjango-rest-framework-json Web TokensVersions  from including (>=) 1.15.0andbefore (<) 1.15.1cpe:2.3:a:styria:django-rest-framework-json_web_tokens:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-01-18  0.16%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-01-03  0.14%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/drf-jwt/1.15.1/#history", "ref_desc": "drf-jwt \u00b7 PyPIRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt/issues/484", "ref_desc": "Status \u00b7 Issue #484 \u00b7 jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Styria-Digital/django-rest-framework-jwt/issues/36", "ref_desc": "Blacklisted tokens can still be refreshed \u00b7 Issue #36 \u00b7 Styria-Digital/django-rest-framework-jwt \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
