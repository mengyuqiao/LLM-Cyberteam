{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10255", "Description": "Modern DRAM chips (DDR4 and LPDDR4 after 2015) are affected by a vulnerability in deployment of internal mitigations against RowHammer attacks known as Target Row Refresh (TRR), aka the TRRespass issue. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to create certain access patterns to trigger bit flips on affected memory modules, aka a Many-sided RowHammer attack. This means that, even when chips advertised as RowHammer-free are used, attackers may still be able to conduct privilege-escalation attacks against the kernel, conduct privilege-escalation attacks against the Sudo binary, and achieve cross-tenant virtual-machine access by corrupting RSA keys. The issue affects chips produced by SK Hynix, Micron, and Samsung. NOTE: tracking DRAM supply-chain issues is not straightforward because a single product model from a single vendor may use DRAM chips from different manufacturers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10255", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSamsung\u00bbDdr4\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:h:samsung:ddr4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSamsung\u00bbLpddr4\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:h:samsung:lpddr4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicron\u00bbDdr4 Sdram\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:h:micron:ddr4_sdram:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicron\u00bbLpddr4\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:h:micron:lpddr4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSkhynix\u00bbDdr4 Sdram\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:h:skhynix:ddr4_sdram:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSkhynix\u00bbLpddr4\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:h:skhynix:lpddr4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.27%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-24  0.26%  0.26%  0.00 \n 3  2024-10-04  0.30%  0.26%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-09-21  0.32%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-07-04  0.22%  0.32%  +0.10 \n 6  2024-05-20  0.18%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-02-15  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-01-13  0.16%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.16%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vusec/trrespass", "ref_desc": "GitHub - vusec/trrespass: TRRespassProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://thehackernews.com/2020/03/rowhammer-vulnerability-ddr4-dram.html", "ref_desc": "Poor Rowhammer Fixes On DDR4 DRAM Chips Re-Enable Bit Flipping AttacksThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.vusec.net/projects/trrespass/", "ref_desc": "TRRespass - VUSecThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://download.vusec.net/papers/trrespass_sp20.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/antumbral/status/1237425959407513600", "ref_desc": "Katelyn Gadd on Twitter: \"I love that DRAM manufacturers apparently decided the solution for Rowhammer was \"fix the most common version of it in a way that has an incredibly obvious workaround\", and tThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/vu5ec/status/1237399112590467072", "ref_desc": "VUSec on Twitter: \"Remember #Rowhammer?
