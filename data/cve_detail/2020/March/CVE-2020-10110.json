{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10110", "Description": "Citrix Gateway 11.1, 12.0, and 12.1 allows Information Exposure Through Caching. NOTE: Citrix disputes this as not a vulnerability. There is no sensitive information disclosure through the cache headers on Citrix ADC. The \"Via\" header lists cache protocols and recipients between the start and end points for a request or a response. The \"Age\" header provides the age of the cached response in seconds. Both headers are commonly used for proxy cache and the information is not sensitive", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10110", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCitrix\u00bbGateway Firmware\u00bbVersion:11.1cpe:2.3:o:citrix:gateway_firmware:11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCitrix\u00bbGateway Firmware\u00bbVersion:12.0cpe:2.3:o:citrix:gateway_firmware:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCitrix\u00bbGateway Firmware\u00bbVersion:12.1cpe:2.3:o:citrix:gateway_firmware:12.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.24%  0.31%  -0.92 \n 2  2023-12-25  0.95%  1.24%  +0.28 \n 3  2023-06-23  0.67%  0.95%  +0.28 \n 4  2023-05-24  0.48%  0.67%  +0.20 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.48%  -0.48 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Mar/7", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2020-004] Information Exposure Through Caching (CWE-512) in Citrix Gateway (CVE-2020-10110)Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156656/Citrix-Gateway-11.1-12.0-12.1-Information-Disclosure.html", "ref_desc": "Citrix Gateway 11.1 / 12.0 / 12.1 Information Disclosure \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.citrix.com/search", "ref_desc": "SearchVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Tf6JJhaz13hR8wg1Cig7wlQim1U.html"}]}
