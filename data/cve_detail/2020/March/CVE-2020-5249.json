{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5249", "Description": "In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.3 and 3.12.4, if an application using Puma allows untrusted input in an early-hints header, an attacker can use a carriage return character to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting. While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to CVE-2020-5247, which fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses. This has been fixed in 4.3.3 and 3.12.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5249", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.12.3cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.3.2cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.14%  -0.08 \n 2  2024-06-26  0.15%  0.22%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-01-22  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.11%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/113/Improper-Neutralization-of-CRLF-Sequences-in-HTTP-Headers-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NJ3LL5F5QADB6LM46GXZETREAKZMQNRD/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: rubygem-puma-4.3.3-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-MPUojQ2TBNq6JdkM5DmwhzjPfY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-33vf-4xgg-9r58", "ref_desc": "HTTP Response Splitting (Early Hints) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 puma/puma \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DIHVO3CQMU7BZC7FCTSRJ33YDNS3GFPK/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 30 Update: rubygem-puma-3.12.4-1.fc30 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JZHRLsDItA_mITLUa-iTTy1NVs4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting", "ref_desc": "HTTP Response Splitting | OWASPThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ml2g0upyU1wi-gpfPZPiSpdPzTI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BMJ3CGZ3DLBJ5WUUKMI5ZFXFJQMXJZIK/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: rubygem-puma-3.12.4-1.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Nh0uR7QS5H4OFWe_QYrzaf_s3Aw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/c22712fc93284a45a93f9ad7023888f3a65524f3", "ref_desc": "HTTP Injection - fix bug + 1 more vector (#2136) \u00b7 puma/puma@c22712f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-84j7-475p-hp8v", "ref_desc": "HTTP Response Splitting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 puma/puma \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wdb97JZzkvb6ir14TyzmpE5E248.html"}]}
