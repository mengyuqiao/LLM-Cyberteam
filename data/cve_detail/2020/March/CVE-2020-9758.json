{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-9758", "Description": "An issue was discovered in chat.php in LiveZilla Live Chat 8.0.1.3 (Helpdesk). A blind JavaScript injection lies in the name parameter. Triggering this can fetch the username and passwords of the helpdesk employees in the URI. This leads to a privilege escalation, from unauthenticated to user-level access, leading to full account takeover. The attack fetches multiple credentials because they are stored in the database (stored XSS). This affects the mobile/chat URI via the lgn and psswrd parameters.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9758", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nLivezilla\u00bbLivezillaVersions  before (<) 8.0.1.3cpe:2.3:a:livezilla:livezilla:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.17%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.20%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ari034/CVE-2020-9758", "ref_desc": "GitHub - ari034/CVE-2020-9758: Form submission for vulnerability in livezillaThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
