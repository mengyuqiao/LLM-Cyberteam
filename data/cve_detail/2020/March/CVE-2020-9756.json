{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-9756", "Description": "Patriot Viper RGB Driver 1.1 and prior exposes IOCTL and allows insufficient access control. The IOCTL Codes 0x80102050 and 0x80102054 allows a local user with low privileges to read/write 1/2/4 bytes from or to an IO port. This could be leveraged in a number of ways to ultimately run code with elevated privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9756", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPatriotmemory\u00bbViper Rgb FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.1cpe:2.3:o:patriotmemory:viper_rgb_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Patriotmemory\u00bbViper Rgb\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/viper-rgb-driver-multiple-vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "Viper RGB Driver Kernel Buffer Overflow Local Privilege EscalationExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B6bHegiAHflKX1Zyg5PtLqTZir8.html"}]}
