{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3266", "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Solution software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and submitting crafted input to the CLI utility. The attacker must be authenticated to access the CLI utility. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3266", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan FirmwareVersions  before (<) 19.2.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:sd-wan_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltegb Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-4gltena Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100-6g Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge 100\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge 1000\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge 100b\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge 100m\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge 100wm\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge 2000\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge 5000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwclici-cvrQpH9v", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN Solution Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
