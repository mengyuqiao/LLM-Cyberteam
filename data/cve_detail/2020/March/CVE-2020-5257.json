{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5257", "Description": "In Administrate (rubygem) before version 0.13.0, when sorting by attributes on a dashboard, the direction parameter was not validated before being interpolated into the SQL query. This could present a SQL injection if the attacker were able to modify the `direction` parameter and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections. Whilst this does have a high-impact, to exploit this you need access to the Administrate dashboards, which we would expect to be behind authentication. This is patched in wersion 0.13.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5257", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtbot\u00bbAdministrate\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 0.13.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtbot:administrate:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-943 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/943/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Data-Query-Lo.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/commit/3ab838b83c5f565fba50e0c6f66fe4517f98eed3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2p5p-m353-833w \u00b7 thoughtbot/administrate@3ab838b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/security/advisories/GHSA-2p5p-m353-833w", "ref_desc": "Sort order SQL injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 thoughtbot/administrate \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
