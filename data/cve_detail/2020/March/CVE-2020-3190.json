{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3190", "Description": "A vulnerability in the IPsec packet processor of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for IPsec sessions to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of packets by the IPsec packet processor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious ICMP error messages to an affected device that get punted to the IPsec packet processor. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deplete IPsec memory, resulting in all future IPsec packets to an affected device being dropped by the device. Manual intervention is required to recover from this situation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3190", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  before (<) 6.4.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 6.6.0andbefore (<) 6.6.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 7.1.0andbefore (<) 7.1.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-08  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-ipsec-dos-q8UPX6m", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software IPsec Packet Processor Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
