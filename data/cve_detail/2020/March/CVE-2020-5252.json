{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5252", "Description": "The command-line \"safety\" package for Python has a potential security issue. There are two Python characteristics that allow malicious code to \u201cpoison-pill\u201d command-line Safety package detection routines by disguising, or obfuscating, other malicious or non-secure packages. This vulnerability is considered to be of low severity because the attack makes use of an existing Python condition, not the Safety tool itself. This can happen if: You are running Safety in a Python environment that you don\u2019t trust. You are running Safety from the same Python environment where you have your dependencies installed. Dependency packages are being installed arbitrarily or without proper verification. Users can mitigate this issue by doing any of the following: Perform a static analysis by installing Docker and running the Safety Docker image: $ docker run --rm -it pyupio/safety check -r requirements.txt Run Safety against a static dependencies list, such as the requirements.txt file, in a separate, clean Python environment. Run Safety from a Continuous Integration pipeline. Use PyUp.io, which runs Safety in a controlled environment and checks Python for dependencies without any need to install them. Use PyUp's Online Requirements Checker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5252", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPyup\u00bbSafetyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.8.6cpe:2.3:a:pyup:safety:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-807 Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/807/Reliance-on-Untrusted-Inputs-in-a-Security-Decision.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pyup.io/posts/patched-vulnerability/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-5252Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyupio/safety/security/advisories/GHSA-7q25-qrjw-6fg2", "ref_desc": "Python Auditing Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pyupio/safety \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/akoumjian/python-safety-vuln", "ref_desc": "GitHub - akoumjian/python-safety-vuln: Circumvent any python package scanner installed to the same python environment.Product;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
