{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5256", "Description": "BookStack before version 0.25.5 has a vulnerability where a user could upload PHP files through image upload functions, which would allow them to execute code on the host system remotely. They would then have the permissions of the PHP process. This most impacts scenarios where non-trusted users are given permission to upload images in any area of the application. The issue was addressed in a series of patches in versions 0.25.3, 0.25.4 and 0.25.5. Users should upgrade to at least v0.25.5 to avoid this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5256", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nBookstackapp\u00bbBookstackVersions  before (<) 0.25.3cpe:2.3:a:bookstackapp:bookstack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.24%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.24%  -1.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-95 Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/95/Improper-Neutralization-of-Directives-in-Dynamically-Evaluat.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.4", "ref_desc": "Release BookStack Beta v0.25.4 \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-g9rq-x4fj-f5hx", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution Through Image Uploads \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.3", "ref_desc": "Release BookStack Beta v0.25.3 \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.5", "ref_desc": "Release BookStack Beta v0.25.5 \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
