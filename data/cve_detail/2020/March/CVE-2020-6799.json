{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6799", "Description": "Command line arguments could have been injected during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for certain unsupported file types. This required Firefox to be configured as the default handler for a given file type and for a file downloaded to be opened in a third party application that insufficiently sanitized URL data. In that situation, clicking a link in the third party application could have been used to retrieve and execute files whose location was supplied through command line arguments. Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems and when Firefox is configured as the default handler for non-default filetypes. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 73 and Firefox < ESR68.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6799", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMozilla\u00bbFirefoxVersions  before (<) 73.0cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMozilla\u00bbFirefox EsrVersions  before (<) 68.5.0cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox_esr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-01-04  0.29%  0.28%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-12-20  0.24%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.24%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-02", "ref_desc": "Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202003-02) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9pUr8cFgqD3xIwxWR-vj4_8FXJk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-05/", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 73 \u2014 MozillaVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ATdZD9HL5xB3zWVTMH5qbPjyF1I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1606596", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-06/", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR68.5 \u2014 MozillaVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VraMb8VM6892F6UnMxYgeTJ-CiY.html"}]}
