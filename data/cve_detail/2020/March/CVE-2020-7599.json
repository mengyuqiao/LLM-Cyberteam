{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7599", "Description": "All versions of com.gradle.plugin-publish before 0.11.0 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. When a plugin author publishes a Gradle plugin while running Gradle with the --info log level flag, the Gradle Logger logs an AWS pre-signed URL. If this build log is publicly visible (as it is in many popular public CI systems like TravisCI) this AWS pre-signed URL would allow a malicious actor to replace a recently uploaded plugin with their own.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7599", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGradle\u00bbPlugin PublishingVersions  before (<) 0.11.0cpe:2.3:a:gradle:plugin_publishing:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMGRADLEPLUGINPUBLISH-559866", "ref_desc": "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File in com.gradle.plugin-publish:com.gradle.plugin-publish.gradle.plugin | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.gradle.org/plugin-portal-update", "ref_desc": "Plugin Portal Security CVE-2020-7599Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
