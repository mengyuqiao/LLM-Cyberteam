{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3164", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause high CPU usage on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of specific HTTP request headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a prolonged status of high CPU utilization relative to the GUI process(es). Upon successful exploitation of this vulnerability, an affected device will still be operative, but its response time and overall performance may be degraded.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3164", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security ApplianceVersions  up to, including, (<=) 12.0.1-268cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbContent Security Management ApplianceVersions  before (<) 13.6.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:content_security_management_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security ApplianceVersions  up to, including, (<=) 13.0.0-392cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCloud Email SecurityVersions  up to, including, (<=) 13.0.0-392cpe:2.3:a:cisco:cloud_email_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-08  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cont-sec-gui-dos-nJ625dXb", "ref_desc": "Cisco ESA, Cisco WSA, and Cisco SMA GUI Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
