{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5289", "Description": "In Elide before 4.5.14, it is possible for an adversary to \"guess and check\" the value of a model field they do not have access to assuming they can read at least one other field in the model. The adversary can construct filter expressions for an inaccessible field to filter a collection. The presence or absence of models in the returned collection can be used to reconstruct the value of the inaccessible field. Resolved in Elide 4.5.14 and greater.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5289", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nElide\u00bbElideVersions  before (<) 4.5.14cpe:2.3:a:elide:elide:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yahoo/elide/pull/1236/commits/a985f0f9c448aabe70bc904337096399de4576dc", "ref_desc": "Enforce ReadPermission for filter joins by wcekan \u00b7 Pull Request #1236 \u00b7 yahoo/elide \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yahoo/elide/security/advisories/GHSA-2mxr-89gf-rc4v", "ref_desc": "Read permissions not enforced for client provided filter expressions. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yahoo/elide \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yahoo/elide/pull/1236", "ref_desc": "Enforce ReadPermission for filter joins by wcekan \u00b7 Pull Request #1236 \u00b7 yahoo/elide \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
