{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13955", "Description": "HttpUtils#getURLConnection method disables explicitly hostname verification for HTTPS connections making clients vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Calcite uses internally this method to connect with Druid and Splunk so information leakage may happen when using the respective Calcite adapters. The method itself is in a utility class so people may use it to create vulnerable HTTPS connections for other applications. From Apache Calcite 1.26 onwards, the hostname verification will be performed using the default JVM truststore.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13955", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCalciteVersions  before (<) 1.26cpe:2.3:a:apache:calcite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-09-01  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  9.03%  0.06%  -8.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0b0fbe2038388175951ce1028182d980f9e9a7328be13d52dab70bb3%40%3Cdev.calcite.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2020-13955] Apache Calcite Disabled HTTPS Hostname Verification - Pony MailMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
