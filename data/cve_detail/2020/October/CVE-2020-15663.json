{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15663", "Description": "If Firefox is installed to a user-writable directory, the Mozilla Maintenance Service would execute updater.exe from the install location with system privileges. Although the Mozilla Maintenance Service does ensure that updater.exe is signed by Mozilla, the version could have been rolled back to a previous version which would have allowed exploitation of an older bug and arbitrary code execution with System Privileges. *Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80, Thunderbird < 78.2, Thunderbird < 68.12, Firefox ESR < 68.12, and Firefox ESR < 78.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15663", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMozilla\u00bbFirefoxVersions  from including (>=) 78.0andbefore (<) 78.2cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMozilla\u00bbFirefoxVersions  before (<) 80.0cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMozilla\u00bbThunderbirdVersions  from including (>=) 78.0andbefore (<) 78.2cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:thunderbird:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMozilla\u00bbThunderbirdVersions  from including (>=) 68.0andbefore (<) 68.12cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:thunderbird:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMozilla\u00bbFirefox EsrVersions  from including (>=) 68.0andbefore (<) 68.12cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox_esr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.63%  0.62%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-05  0.72%  0.63%  -0.09 \n 3  2024-07-21  0.69%  0.72%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-02-19  0.79%  0.69%  -0.10 \n 5  2023-06-17  0.77%  0.79%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.71%  0.77%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-04-12  0.61%  0.71%  +0.11 \n 8  2023-03-30  0.60%  0.61%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  2.76%  0.60%  -2.16 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-36/", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 80 \u2014 MozillaRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/66DWojKlzi44mDgHSWBGW3-HDgg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-40/", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 68.12 \u2014 MozillaRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/C09ebpFjKxuBNSzO8hqcmTk4ZyI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1643199", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedIssue Tracking;Permissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-37/", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 68.12 \u2014 MozillaRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nmgngRr6VH6V1E_6rKi5g2tETu0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-38/", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 78.2 \u2014 MozillaRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PFPe7jRPdgAI9SUpPC5iKzY2hnA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-41/", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 78.2 \u2014 MozillaRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rV5afw4w-Rg4xheYJy3L3PMqG8s.html"}]}
