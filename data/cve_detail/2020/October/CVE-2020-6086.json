{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6086", "Description": "An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the ENIP Request Path Data Segment functionality of Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B. A specially crafted network request can cause a loss of communications with the device resulting in denial-of-service. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.If the Simple Segment Sub-Type is supplied, the device treats the byte following as the Data Size in words. When this value represents a size greater than what remains in the packet data, the device enters a fault state where communication with the device is lost and a physical power cycle is required.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6086", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRockwellautomation\u00bbFlex I/o 1794-aent/b Firmware\u00bbVersion:4.003cpe:2.3:o:rockwellautomation:flex_i\\/o_1794-aent\\/b_firmware:4.003:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Rockwellautomation\u00bbFlex I/o 1794-aent/b\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-09-20  0.15%  0.08%  -0.07 \n 4  2023-09-06  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-06-30  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-21  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-05-09  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1007", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2020-1007 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/i8myDXTCrI-pgSBQvd6khKCjMpA.html"}]}
