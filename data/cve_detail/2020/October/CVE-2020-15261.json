{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15261", "Description": "On Windows the Veyon Service before version 4.4.2 contains an unquoted service path vulnerability, allowing locally authenticated users with administrative privileges to run malicious executables with LocalSystem privileges. Since Veyon users (both students and teachers) usually don't have administrative privileges, this vulnerability is only dangerous in anyway unsafe setups. The problem has been fixed in version 4.4.2. As a workaround, the exploitation of the vulnerability can be prevented by revoking administrative privileges from all potentially untrustworthy users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15261", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVeyon\u00bbVeyonVersions  before (<) 4.4.2cpe:2.3:a:veyon:veyon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.39%  +0.26 \n 2  2024-12-14  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-09-25  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  3.66%  0.14%  -3.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-428 Unquoted Search Path or Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/428/Unquoted-Search-Path-or-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48246", "ref_desc": "Veyon 4.3.4 - 'VeyonService' Unquoted Service Path - Windows local ExploitExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/veyon/veyon/security/advisories/GHSA-c8cc-x786-hqqp", "ref_desc": "Unquoted service path vulnerability on Microsoft Windows \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 veyon/veyon \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/veyon/veyon/issues/657", "ref_desc": "Unquoted service path \u00b7 Issue #657 \u00b7 veyon/veyon \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162873/Veyon-4.4.1-Unquoted-Service-Path.html", "ref_desc": "Veyon 4.4.1 Unquoted Service Path \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49925", "ref_desc": "Veyon 4.4.1 - 'VeyonService' Unquoted Service Path - Windows local ExploitExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/veyon/veyon/commit/f231ec511b9a09f43f49b2c7bb7c60b8046276b1", "ref_desc": "WindowsServiceControl: quote service binary path \u00b7 veyon/veyon@f231ec5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
