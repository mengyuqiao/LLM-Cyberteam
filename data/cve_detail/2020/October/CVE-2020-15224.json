{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15224", "Description": "In Open Enclave before version 0.12.0, an information disclosure vulnerability exists when an enclave application using the syscalls provided by the sockets.edl is loaded by a malicious host application. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could read privileged data from the enclave heap across trust boundaries. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information otherwise considered confidential in an enclave, which could be used in further compromises. The issue has been addressed in version 0.12.0 and the current master branch. Users will need to to recompile their applications against the patched libraries to be protected from this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15224", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nOpenenclave\u00bbOpenenclaveVersions  before (<) 0.12.0cpe:2.3:a:openenclave:openenclave:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0120", "ref_desc": "openenclave/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 openenclave/openenclave \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/commit/bcac8e7acb514429fee9e0b5d0c7a0308fd4d76b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-525h-wxcc-f66m \u00b7 openenclave/openenclave@bcac8e7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/security/advisories/GHSA-525h-wxcc-f66m", "ref_desc": "Socket syscalls can leak enclave memory contents \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openenclave/openenclave \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
