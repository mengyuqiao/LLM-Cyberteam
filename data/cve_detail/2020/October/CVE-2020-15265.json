{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15265", "Description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, an attacker can pass an invalid `axis` value to `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`. This results in accessing a dimension outside the rank of the input tensor in the C++ kernel implementation. However, dim_size only does a DCHECK to validate the argument and then uses it to access the corresponding element of an array. Since in normal builds, `DCHECK`-like macros are no-ops, this results in segfault and access out of bounds of the array. The issue is patched in eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808 and TensorFlow 2.4.0 will be released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15265", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersions  before (<) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-05-28  0.17%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.17%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808", "ref_desc": "Prevent segfault in `quantize_and_dequantize` \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@eccb7ec \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-rrfp-j2mp-hq9c", "ref_desc": "Segfault in `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/42105", "ref_desc": "Segmentation fault in tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize \u00b7 Issue #42105 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
