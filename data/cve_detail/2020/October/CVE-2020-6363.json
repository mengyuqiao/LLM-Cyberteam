{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6363", "Description": "SAP Commerce Cloud, versions - 1808, 1811, 1905, 2005, exposes several web applications that maintain sessions with a user. These sessions are established after the user has authenticated with username/passphrase credentials. The user can change their own passphrase, but this does not invalidate active sessions that the user may have with SAP Commerce Cloud web applications, which gives an attacker the opportunity to reuse old session credentials, resulting in Insufficient Session Expiration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6363", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbCommerce Cloud\u00bbVersion:1808cpe:2.3:a:sap:commerce_cloud:1808:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbCommerce Cloud\u00bbVersion:1811cpe:2.3:a:sap:commerce_cloud:1811:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbCommerce Cloud\u00bbVersion:1905cpe:2.3:a:sap:commerce_cloud:1905:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbCommerce Cloud\u00bbVersion:2005cpe:2.3:a:sap:commerce_cloud:2005:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=558632196", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Patch Day \u2013 October 2020 - Product Security Response at SAP - Community WikiVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Qo5j6UoE8WgD3BblxENQ906qWE0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2965287", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
