{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15175", "Description": "In GLPI before version 9.5.2, the `?pluginimage.send.php?` endpoint allows a user to specify an image from a plugin. The parameters can be maliciously crafted to instead delete the .htaccess file for the files directory. Any user becomes able to read all the files and folders contained in \u201c/files/\u201d. Some of the sensitive information that is compromised are the user sessions, logs, and more. An attacker would be able to get the Administrators session token and use that to authenticate. The issue is patched in version 9.5.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15175", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpiVersions  before (<) 9.5.2cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-23  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-22  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  9.03%  0.12%  -8.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/commit/6ca9a0e77299a755c356d758344a23278df67f65", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-rm52-jx9h-rwcp \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi@6ca9a0e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-rm52-jx9h-rwcp", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated File Deletion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
