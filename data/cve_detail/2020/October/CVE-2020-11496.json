{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11496", "Description": "Sprecher SPRECON-E firmware prior to 8.64b might allow local attackers with access to engineering data to insert arbitrary code. This firmware lacks the validation of the input values on the device side, which is provided by the engineering software during parameterization. Attackers with access to local configuration files can therefore insert malicious commands that are executed after compiling them to valid parameter files (\u201cPDLs\u201d), transferring them to the device, and restarting the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11496", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSprecher-automation\u00bbSprecon-eVersions  before (<) 8.64bcpe:2.3:o:sprecher-automation:sprecon-e:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.sprecher-automation.com/en/it-security/", "ref_desc": "Sprecher Automation: IT SecurityVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1Gwuv9Bcg6uAXoQ9Smc6fyE1FvE.html"}]}
