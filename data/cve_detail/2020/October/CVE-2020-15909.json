{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15909", "Description": "SolarWinds N-central through 2020.1 allows session hijacking and requires user interaction or physical access. The N-Central JSESSIONID cookie attribute is not checked against multiple sources such as sourceip, MFA claim, etc. as long as the victim stays logged in within N-Central. To take advantage of this, cookie could be stolen and the JSESSIONID can be captured. On its own this is not a surprising result; low security tools allow the cookie to roam from machine to machine. The JSESSION cookie can then be used on the attackers\u2019 workstation by browsing to the victim\u2019s NCentral server URL and replacing the JSESSIONID attribute value by the captured value. Expected behavior would be to check this against a second source and enforce at least a reauthentication or multi factor request as N-Central is a highly privileged service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15909", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolarwinds\u00bbN-centralVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2020.1cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:n-central:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.49%  +0.23 \n 2  2024-02-22  0.25%  0.26%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-05  0.25%  0.25%  0.00 \n 4  2023-05-26  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.solarwindsmsp.com/products/n-central", "ref_desc": "N-central On-Premises Remote Monitoring Software | SolarWinds MSPProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hebNnOtjwYikvNPtH1ibTp5Phtw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://limenetworks.nl/wp-content/uploads/CVE-934261-v-1.2.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/L9DbOer5bB3HC-5_VSVOm-rWKzA.html"}]}
