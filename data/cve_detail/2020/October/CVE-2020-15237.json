{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15237", "Description": "In Shrine before version 3.3.0, when using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin, it's possible for the attacker to use a timing attack to guess the signature of the derivation URL. The problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated signature in constant time, using `Rack::Utils.secure_compare`. Users using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin are urged to upgrade to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater. A possible workaround is provided in the linked advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15237", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShrinerb\u00bbShrine\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 3.3.0cpe:2.3:a:shrinerb:shrine:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-06-21  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-12  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine/security/advisories/GHSA-5jjv-x4fq-qjwp", "ref_desc": "Possible timing attack in derivation_endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shrinerb/shrine \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine/commit/1b27090ce31543bf39f186c20ea47c8250fca2f0", "ref_desc": "Securely compare signature in derivation_endpoint \u00b7 shrinerb/shrine@1b27090 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
