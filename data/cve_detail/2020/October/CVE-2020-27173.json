{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27173", "Description": "In vm-superio before 0.1.1, the serial console FIFO can grow to unlimited memory usage when data is sent to the input source (i.e., standard input). This behavior cannot be reproduced from the guest side. When no rate limiting is in place, the host can be subject to memory pressure, impacting all other VMs running on the same host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27173", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVm-superio Project\u00bbVm-superioVersions  before (<) 0.1.1cpe:2.3:a:vm-superio_project:vm-superio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-01  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-22  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-superio/pull/19", "ref_desc": "Fix for #17 - v0.1.1_release branch by andreeaflorescu \u00b7 Pull Request #19 \u00b7 rust-vmm/vm-superio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-superio/issues/17", "ref_desc": "Implementation of the serial console may allocate an unbounded amount of memory \u00b7 Issue #17 \u00b7 rust-vmm/vm-superio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
