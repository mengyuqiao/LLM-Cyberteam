{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26876", "Description": "The wp-courses plugin through 2.0.27 for WordPress allows remote attackers to bypass the intended payment step (for course videos and materials) by using the /wp-json REST API, as exploited in the wild in September 2020. This occurs because show_in_rest is enabled for custom post types (e.g., /wp-json/wp/v2/course and /wp-json/wp/v2/lesson exist).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26876", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWpcoursesplugin\u00bbWp-courses\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.27cpe:2.3:a:wpcoursesplugin:wp-courses:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "18.98% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  8.87%  18.98%  +10.11 \n 2  2024-06-24  6.46%  8.87%  +2.41 \n 3  2024-06-06  4.67%  6.46%  +1.80 \n 4  2024-03-12  3.35%  4.67%  +1.32 \n 5  2024-02-10  2.79%  3.35%  +0.56 \n 6  2024-01-24  1.99%  2.79%  +0.80 \n 7  2023-11-24  1.63%  1.99%  +0.36 \n 8  2023-11-10  1.16%  1.63%  +0.48 \n 9  2023-06-23  1.27%  1.16%  -0.12 \n 10  2023-05-28  1.46%  1.27%  -0.18 \n 11  2023-05-14  1.19%  1.46%  +0.27 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.14%  1.19%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2389243", "ref_desc": "Changeset 2389243 \u2013 WordPress Plugin RepositoryThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2388997", "ref_desc": "Changeset 2388997 \u2013 WordPress Plugin RepositoryThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.redtimmy.com/critical-information-disclosure-on-wp-courses-plugin-exposes-private-course-videos-and-materials/", "ref_desc": "Critical Information Disclosure on WP Courses plugin exposes private course videos and materials - Red Timmy SecurityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
