{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7744", "Description": "This affects all versions of package com.mintegral.msdk:alphab. The Android SDK distributed by the company contains malicious functionality in this module that tracks: 1. Downloads from Google urls either within Google apps or via browser including file downloads, e-mail attachments and Google Docs links. 2. All apk downloads, either organic or not. Mintegral listens to download events in Android's download manager and detects if the downloaded file's url contains: a. google.com or comes from a Google app (the com.android.vending package) b. Ends with .apk for apk downloads In both cases, the module sends the captured data back to Mintegral's servers. Note that the malicious functionality keeps running even if the app is currently not in focus (running in the background).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7744", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMintegral\u00bbMintegraladsdk\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:mintegral:mintegraladsdk:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Google\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.17%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-08-19  0.10%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2024-08-04  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-01  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-05-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-26  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/research/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/", "ref_desc": "SourMint Malicious SDK | SnykTechnical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/J1hWdbUBtDykisykXTciyFE_IyQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/blog/remote-code-execution-rce-sourmint/", "ref_desc": "Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OyYWuN9ObRSxBJIOoFYWA1aqGoc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMINTEGRALMSDK-1018714", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
