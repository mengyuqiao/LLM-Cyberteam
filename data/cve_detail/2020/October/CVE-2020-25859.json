{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25859", "Description": "The QCMAP_CLI utility in the Qualcomm QCMAP software suite prior to versions released in October 2020 uses a system() call without validating the input, while handling a SetGatewayUrl() request. A local attacker with shell access can pass shell metacharacters and run arbitrary commands. If QCMAP_CLI can be run via sudo or setuid, this also allows elevating privileges to root. This version of QCMAP is used in many kinds of networking devices, primarily mobile hotspots and LTE routers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25859", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nQualcomm\u00bbQcmap\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:qualcomm:qcmap:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.31%  +0.26 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://vdoo.com/blog/qualcomm-qcmap-vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "Major Vulnerabilities in Qualcomm QCMAPExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QQ5hip5pxasuJDUw9pt1-LTs9W4.html"}]}
