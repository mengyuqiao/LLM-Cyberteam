{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15229", "Description": "Singularity (an open source container platform) from version 3.1.1 through 3.6.3 has a vulnerability. Due to insecure handling of path traversal and the lack of path sanitization within `unsquashfs`, it is possible to overwrite/create any files on the host filesystem during the extraction with a crafted squashfs filesystem. The extraction occurs automatically for unprivileged (either installation or with `allow setuid = no`) run of Singularity when a user attempt to run an image which is a local SIF image or a single file containing a squashfs filesystem and is coming from remote sources `library://` or `shub://`. Image build is also impacted in a more serious way as it can be used by a root user, allowing an attacker to overwrite/create files leading to a system compromise, so far bootstrap methods `library`, `shub` and `localimage` are triggering the squashfs extraction. This issue is addressed in Singularity 3.6.4. All users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.4 especially if they use Singularity mainly for building image as root user. There is no solid workaround except to temporary avoid to use unprivileged mode with single file images in favor of sandbox images instead. Regarding image build, temporary avoid to build from `library` and `shub` sources and as much as possible use `--fakeroot` or a VM for that.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15229", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.2cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbBackports Sle\u00bbVersion:15.0UpdateSP2cpe:2.3:a:opensuse:backports_sle:15.0:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylabs\u00bbSingularityVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.1andup to, including, (<=) 3.6.3cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.18%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-09-20  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-18  0.25%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-06-30  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-05-21  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-25  0.15%  0.22%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.15%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/pull/5611", "ref_desc": "Merge GHSA-7gcp-w6ww-2xv9 fixes for release 3.6.4 by dctrud \u00b7 Pull Request #5611 \u00b7 hpcng/singularity \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/security/advisories/GHSA-7gcp-w6ww-2xv9", "ref_desc": "Path traversal and files overwrite with unsquashfs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hpcng/singularity \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/blob/v3.6.4/CHANGELOG.md#security-related-fixes", "ref_desc": "singularity/CHANGELOG.md at v3.6.4 \u00b7 hpcng/singularity \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00071.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1769-1: important: Security updateBroken Link;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00070.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1770-1: important: Security updateBroken Link;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/commit/eba3dea260b117198fdb6faf41f2482ab2f8d53e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #5611 from dctrud/36-sec \u00b7 hpcng/singularity@eba3dea \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00009.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1814-1: important: Security updateBroken Link;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
