{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15245", "Description": "In Sylius before versions 1.6.9, 1.7.9 and 1.8.3, the user may register in a shop by email mail@example.com, verify it, change it to the mail another@domain.com and stay verified and enabled. This may lead to having accounts addressed to totally different emails, that were verified. Note, that this way one is not able to take over any existing account (guest or normal one). The issue has been patched in Sylius 1.6.9, 1.7.9 and 1.8.3. As a workaround, you may resolve this issue on your own by creating a custom event listener, which will listen to the sylius.customer.pre_update event. You can determine that email has been changed if customer email and user username are different. They are synchronized later on. Pay attention, to email changing behavior for administrators. You may need to skip this logic for them. In order to achieve this, you should either check master request path info, if it does not contain /admin prefix or adjust event triggered during customer update in the shop. You can find more information on how to customize the event here.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15245", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.0andbefore (<) 1.7.9cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  before (<) 1.6.9cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.8.0andbefore (<) 1.8.3cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/commit/60636d711a4011e8694d10d201b53632c7e8ecaf", "ref_desc": "[Shop] Disabling customer when email has been changed \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius@60636d7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/security/advisories/GHSA-6gw4-x63h-5499", "ref_desc": "Ability to switch customer email address on account detail page and stay verified \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
