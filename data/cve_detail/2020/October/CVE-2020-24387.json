{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24387", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the yh_create_session() function of yubihsm-shell through 2.0.2. The function does not explicitly check the returned session id from the device. An invalid session id would lead to out-of-bounds read and write operations in the session array. This could be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24387", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nYubico\u00bbYubihsm-shellVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.2cpe:2.3:a:yubico:yubihsm-shell:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.43%  0.39%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.41%  0.43%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-05  0.36%  0.41%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-05-26  0.30%  0.36%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.30%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.inhq.net/posts/yubico-libyubihsm-vuln/", "ref_desc": "Yubico libyubihsm\u2009Vulnerabilities | invd blogExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_h5wemvac7kyVsfQrAYf8S0HnpE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://developers.yubico.com/yubihsm-shell/", "ref_desc": "yubihsm-shellVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dyCiND-Eo14pAFQ-bB4owwaTpAU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-shell", "ref_desc": "GitHub - Yubico/yubihsm-shell: yubihsm-shell and libyubihsmThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/E6q3nefn5Vn90BbfO2TjFIKD5N0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Y77KQJW76M3PFOBFLBT6DLH2NWHYRNZO/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: yubihsm-shell-2.0.3-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/naK5FdM3JNNKqRZ4MCPTq6cycvo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2020-06/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory YSA-2020-06 | YubicoVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YhYCCvuNWleIwVTlfs1o2ZR4CNI.html"}]}
