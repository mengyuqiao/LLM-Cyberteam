{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17406", "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microhard Bullet-LTE prior to v1.2.0-r1112. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the ping parameter provided to tools.sh. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
