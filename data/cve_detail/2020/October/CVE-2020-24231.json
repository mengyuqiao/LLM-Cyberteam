{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24231", "Description": "Symmetric DS <3.12.0 uses mx4j to provide access to JMX over HTTP. mx4j, by default, has no auth and is available on all interfaces. An attacker can interact with JMX: get system info, and invoke MBean methods. It is possible to install additional MBeans from a remote host using MLet that leads to arbitrary code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24231", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJumpmind\u00bbSymmetricdsVersions  before (<) 3.12.0cpe:2.3:a:jumpmind:symmetricds:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.43%  0.51%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-02-08  0.31%  0.43%  +0.13 \n 3  2023-09-11  0.29%  0.31%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-21  0.27%  0.29%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-12  0.26%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.26%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.symmetricds.org/issues/view.php?id=4263", "ref_desc": "0004263: mx4j without auth - SymmetricDS - Issue TrackerVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
