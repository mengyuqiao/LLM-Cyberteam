{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15271", "Description": "In lookatme (python/pypi package) versions prior to 2.3.0, the package automatically loaded the built-in \"terminal\" and \"file_loader\" extensions. Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15271", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLookatme Project\u00bbLookatmeVersions  before (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:lookatme_project:lookatme:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.35%  1.15%  +0.79 \n 2  2023-07-12  0.32%  0.35%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-06-02  0.31%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.31%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/lookatme/#history", "ref_desc": "lookatme \u00b7 PyPIRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/commit/72fe36b784b234548d49dae60b840c37f0eb8d84", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #110 from d0c-s4vage/feature/109-extension_warnings \u00b7 d0c-s4vage/lookatme@72fe36b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/releases/tag/v2.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.3.0 \u00b7 d0c-s4vage/lookatme \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/pull/110", "ref_desc": "Adds warnings about loading extensions by d0c-s4vage \u00b7 Pull Request #110 \u00b7 d0c-s4vage/lookatme \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/security/advisories/GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q", "ref_desc": "Markdown-supplied Shell Command Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 d0c-s4vage/lookatme \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
