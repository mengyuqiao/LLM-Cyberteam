{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-16886", "Description": "<p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in the PowerShellGet V2 module. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass WDAC (Windows Defender Application Control) policy and execute arbitrary code on a policy locked-down machine.</p>\n<p>An attacker must have administrator privileges to create a configuration that includes installing PowerShellGet V2 module onto a machine from the PowerShell Gallery. The WDAC policy must be configured to allow the module to run. After this is done, PowerShell script can be injected and run fully trusted, allowing the attacker arbitrary code execution on the machine.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by changing how URLs are processed.</p>", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-16886", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbPowershellget\u00bbVersion:2.2.5cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:powershellget:2.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-03  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 \n 3  2024-01-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.15%  0.04%  -1.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-16886", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-16886 | PowerShellGet Module WDAC Security Feature Bypass VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
