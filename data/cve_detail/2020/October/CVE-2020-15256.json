{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15256", "Description": "A prototype pollution vulnerability has been found in `object-path` <= 0.11.4 affecting the `set()` method. The vulnerability is limited to the `includeInheritedProps` mode (if version >= 0.11.0 is used), which has to be explicitly enabled by creating a new instance of `object-path` and setting the option `includeInheritedProps: true`, or by using the default `withInheritedProps` instance. The default operating mode is not affected by the vulnerability if version >= 0.11.0 is used. Any usage of `set()` in versions < 0.11.0 is vulnerable. The issue is fixed in object-path version 0.11.5 As a workaround, don't use the `includeInheritedProps: true` options or the `withInheritedProps` instance if using a version >= 0.11.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15256", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nObject-path Project\u00bbObject-path\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.11.5cpe:2.3:a:object-path_project:object-path:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.20%  -0.11 \n 2  2024-03-08  0.22%  0.31%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-07-05  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.14%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-04-03  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  9.03%  0.14%  -8.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-471 Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/471/Modification-of-Assumed-Immutable-Data-MAID-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path/commit/2be3354c6c46215c7635eb1b76d80f1319403c68", "ref_desc": "Fix prototype pollution in set() \u00b7 mariocasciaro/object-path@2be3354 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path/security/advisories/GHSA-cwx2-736x-mf6w", "ref_desc": "Prototype pollution affecting the set() method using the includeInheritedProps mode \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mariocasciaro/object-path \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
