{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24722", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the GAEN (aka Google/Apple Exposure Notifications) protocol through 2020-10-05, as used in COVID-19 applications on Android and iOS. The encrypted metadata block with a TX value lacks a checksum, allowing bitflipping to amplify a contamination attack. This can cause metadata deanonymization and risk-score inflation. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"We do not believe that TX power authentication would be a useful defense against relay attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24722", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nExposure Notifications Project\u00bbExposure Notifications\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2020-10-05cpe:2.3:a:exposure_notifications_project:exposure_notifications:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions\nExposure Notifications Project\u00bbExposure Notifications\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2020-10-05cpe:2.3:a:exposure_notifications_project:exposure_notifications:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.79%  0.23%  -2.56 \n 2  2024-06-24  2.42%  2.79%  +0.37 \n 3  2024-01-09  1.75%  2.42%  +0.67 \n 4  2023-06-23  1.74%  1.75%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-14  1.70%  1.74%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  1.70%  +0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-internals/blob/main/en-risks-and-mitigations-faq.md#additional-considerations", "ref_desc": "exposure-notifications-internals/en-risks-and-mitigations-faq.md at main \u00b7 google/exposure-notifications-internals \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Oct/12", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CVE-2020-24722: GAEN Protocol Metadata Deanonymization and Risk-score Inflation IssuesExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/update-exposure-notifications", "ref_desc": "An update on Exposure NotificationsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UmY27ggKZnLNJkoebvGP1mNhsSE.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159496/GAEN-Protocol-Metadata-Deanonymization-Risk-Score-Inflation.html", "ref_desc": "GAEN Protocol Metadata Deanonymization / Risk-Score Inflation \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
