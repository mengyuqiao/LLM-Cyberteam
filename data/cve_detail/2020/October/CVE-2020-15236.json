{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15236", "Description": "In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit 084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15236", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nRequarks\u00bbWiki.jsVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.80andbefore (<) 2.5.151cpe:2.3:a:requarks:wiki.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-06-21  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-12  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-whpv-5xg2-w527", "ref_desc": "Asset directory traversal with some storage modules \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc", "ref_desc": "fix: strip directory traversal sequences from asset paths \u00b7 Requarks/wiki@084dcd6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
