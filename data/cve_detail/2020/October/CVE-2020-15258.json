{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15258", "Description": "In Wire before 3.20.x, `shell.openExternal` was used without checking the URL. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code on the victims machine by sending messages containing links with arbitrary protocols. The victim has to interact with the link and sees the URL that is opened. The issue was patched by implementing a helper function which checks if the URL's protocol is common. If it is common, the URL will be opened externally. If not, the URL will not be opened and a warning appears for the user informing them that a probably insecure URL was blocked from being executed. The issue is patched in Wire 3.20.x. More technical details about exploitation are available in the linked advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15258", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nWire\u00bbWireVersions  before (<) 3.20.2934cpe:2.3:a:wire:wire:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.75% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.55%  0.75%  -0.80 \n 2  2024-07-03  1.30%  1.55%  +0.25 \n 3  2024-04-07  1.29%  1.30%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-21  0.92%  1.29%  +0.37 \n 5  2024-03-05  0.67%  0.92%  +0.26 \n 6  2024-02-19  0.65%  0.67%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-11-19  0.46%  0.65%  +0.19 \n 8  2023-10-20  0.32%  0.46%  +0.14 \n 9  2023-04-14  0.32%  0.32%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.32%  -1.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop/security/advisories/GHSA-5gpx-9976-ggpm", "ref_desc": "Insecure use of shell.openExternal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wireapp/wire-desktop \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop/commit/b3705fffa75a03f055530f55a754face5ac0623b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5gpx-9976-ggpm \u00b7 wireapp/wire-desktop@b3705ff \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://benjamin-altpeter.de/shell-openexternal-dangers/", "ref_desc": "The dangers of Electron's shell.openExternal()\u2014many paths to remote code executionExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
