{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8349", "Description": "An internal security review has identified an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Cloud Networking Operating System (CNOS)\u2019 optional REST API management interface. This interface is disabled by default and not vulnerable unless enabled. When enabled, it is only vulnerable where attached to a VRF and as allowed by defined ACLs. Lenovo strongly recommends upgrading to a non-vulnerable CNOS release. Where not possible, Lenovo recommends disabling the REST API management interface or restricting access to the management VRF and further limiting access to authorized management stations via ACL.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8349", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nLenovo\u00bbCloud Networking Operating SystemVersions  before (<) 10.10.6.0cpe:2.3:o:lenovo:cloud_networking_operating_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbRackswitch G8272\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbRackswitch G8296\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbRackswitch G8332\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbRackswitch Ne0152t\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbRackswitch Ne10032\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbRackswitch Ne1032\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbRackswitch Ne1032t\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbRackswitch Ne1072t\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbRackswitch Ne2572\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.78% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.81%  0.78%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-23  0.60%  0.81%  +0.21 \n 3  2024-08-03  0.53%  0.60%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-07-01  0.55%  0.53%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-09-20  0.52%  0.55%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-06-30  0.44%  0.52%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-05-21  0.40%  0.44%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-29  0.39%  0.40%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.39%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/LEN-44423", "ref_desc": "Cloud Networking Operating System (CNOS) Vulnerability - Lenovo Support NLVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
