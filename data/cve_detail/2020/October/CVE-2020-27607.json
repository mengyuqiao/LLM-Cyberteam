{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27607", "Description": "In BigBlueButton before 2.2.28 (or earlier), the client-side Mute button only signifies that the server should stop accepting audio data from the client. It does not directly configure the client to stop sending audio data to the server, and thus a modified server could store the audio data and/or transmit it to one or more meeting participants or other third parties.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27607", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebuttonVersions  before (<) 2.2.28cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-07-07  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-28  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.golem.de/news/big-blue-button-das-grosse-blaue-sicherheitsrisiko-2010-151610.html", "ref_desc": "Golem.de: IT-News f\u00fcr ProfisExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s0HluQql2MkGUoxdCwbYufH1irs.html"}]}
