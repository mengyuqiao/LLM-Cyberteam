{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8929", "Description": "A mis-handling of invalid unicode characters in the Java implementation of Tink versions prior to 1.5 allows an attacker to change the ID part of a ciphertext, which result in the creation of a second ciphertext that can decrypt to the same plaintext. This can be a problem with encrypting deterministic AEAD with a single key, and rely on a unique ciphertext-per-plaintext.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8929", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTinkVersions  before (<) 1.5cpe:2.3:a:google:tink:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-176 Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/176/Improper-Handling-of-Unicode-Encoding.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/tink/commit/93d839a5865b9d950dffdc9d0bc99b71280a8899", "ref_desc": "Fixing ciphertext malleability issue in Java caused by storing the ci\u2026 \u00b7 google/tink@93d839a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/tink/security/advisories/GHSA-g5vf-v6wf-7w2r", "ref_desc": "Ciphertext Malleability Issue in Tink Java \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 google/tink \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
