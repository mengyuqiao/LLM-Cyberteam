{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15226", "Description": "In GLPI before version 9.5.2, there is a SQL Injection in the API's search function. Not only is it possible to break the SQL syntax, but it is also possible to utilise a UNION SELECT query to reflect sensitive information such as the current database version, or database user. The most likely scenario for this vulnerability is with someone who has an API account to the system. The issue is patched in version 9.5.2. A proof-of-concept with technical details is available in the linked advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15226", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpiVersions  before (<) 9.5.2cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/commit/3dc4475c56b241ad659cc5c7cb5fb65727409cf0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jwpv-7m4h-5gvc \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi@3dc4475 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-jwpv-7m4h-5gvc", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection in Search API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
