{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14144", "Description": "The git hook feature in Gitea 1.1.0 through 1.12.5 might allow for authenticated remote code execution in customer environments where the documentation was not understood (e.g., one viewpoint is that the dangerousness of this feature should be documented immediately above the ENABLE_GIT_HOOKS line in the config file). NOTE: The vendor has indicated this is not a vulnerability and states \"This is a functionality of the software that is limited to a very limited subset of accounts. If you give someone the privilege to execute arbitrary code on your server, they can execute arbitrary code on your server. We provide very clear warnings to users around this functionality and what it provides.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14144", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGitea\u00bbGiteaVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.12.5cpe:2.3:a:gitea:gitea:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.95% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.28%  96.95%  -0.32 \n 2  2024-10-23  97.32%  97.28%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-09-22  97.34%  97.32%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-08-05  97.32%  97.34%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-07-03  97.29%  97.32%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-06-15  97.25%  97.29%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-05-30  97.28%  97.25%  -0.03 \n 8  2024-04-25  97.23%  97.28%  +0.05 \n 9  2024-04-07  97.25%  97.23%  -0.01 \n 10  2024-03-21  97.27%  97.25%  -0.02 \n 11  2024-03-05  97.28%  97.27%  -0.02 \n 12  2024-02-19  97.23%  97.28%  +0.05 \n 13  2024-02-02  97.18%  97.23%  +0.05 \n 14  2023-12-03  97.21%  97.18%  -0.03 \n 15  2023-11-19  97.16%  97.21%  +0.05 \n 16  2023-11-08  97.12%  97.16%  +0.04 \n 17  2023-10-20  96.96%  97.12%  +0.16 \n 18  2023-10-05  96.84%  96.96%  +0.12 \n 19  2023-09-22  96.67%  96.84%  +0.18 \n 20  2023-09-08  96.77%  96.67%  -0.10 \n 21  2023-07-28  96.92%  96.77%  -0.15 \n 22  2023-07-16  96.79%  96.92%  +0.12 \n 23  2023-05-23  96.69%  96.79%  +0.10 \n 24  2023-04-27  96.48%  96.69%  +0.21 \n 25  2023-04-14  96.68%  96.48%  -0.20 \n 26  2023-03-20  38.80%  96.68%  +57.89 \n 27  2023-03-18  34.11%  38.80%  +4.68 \n 28  2023-03-07  84.99%  34.11%  -50.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PandatiX/CVE-2021-28378#notes", "ref_desc": "GitHub - pandatix/CVE-2021-28378Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.fzi.de/en/news/news/detail-en/artikel/fsa-2020-3-schwachstelle-in-gitea-1125-und-gogs-0122-ermoeglicht-ausfuehrung-von-code-nach-authent/", "ref_desc": "Detail en : FZI Forschungszentrum InformatikThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iX1WEaRHM97e0HjfNSerSN2wpN0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.19/admin/policies/creating-a-pre-receive-hook-script", "ref_desc": "Creating a pre-receive hook script - GitHub DocsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PandatiX/CVE-2021-28378", "ref_desc": "GitHub - PandatiX/CVE-2021-28378Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mb5S3JGe804g0qMHf4otVblPgdI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/server_hooks.html", "ref_desc": "Server hooks | GitLabThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/13058", "ref_desc": "Mitigate Security vulnerability in the git hook feature by Niklas974 \u00b7 Pull Request #13058 \u00b7 go-gitea/gitea \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 go-gitea/gitea \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q239t-yZJpxMKeZfG-iP1zFiguk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162122/Gitea-Git-Hooks-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Gitea Git Hooks Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%402.19/admin/policies/creating-a-pre-receive-hook-script", "ref_desc": "Creating a pre-receive hook script - GitHub Docs", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
