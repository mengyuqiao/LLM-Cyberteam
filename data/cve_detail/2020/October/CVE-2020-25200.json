{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25200", "Description": "Pritunl 1.29.2145.25 allows attackers to enumerate valid VPN usernames via a series of /auth/session login attempts. Initially, the server will return error 401. However, if the username is valid, then after 20 login attempts, the server will start responding with error 400. Invalid usernames will receive error 401 indefinitely. Note: This has been disputed by the vendor as not a vulnerability. They argue that this is an intended design", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25200", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPritunl\u00bbPritunl\u00bbVersion:1.29.2145.25cpe:2.3:a:pritunl:pritunl:1.29.2145.25:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-06-17  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.12%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  5.74%  0.12%  -5.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pritunl.com", "ref_desc": "Pritunl - Open Source Enterprise Distributed OpenVPN, IPsec and WireGuard ServerVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lukaszstu/pritunl/blob/master/CVE-2020-25200", "ref_desc": "pritunl/CVE-2020-25200 at master \u00b7 lukaszstu/pritunl \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pritunl.com/security", "ref_desc": "Pritunl - Advanced SecurityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
