{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10139", "Description": "Acronis True Image 2021 includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an OPENSSLDIR variable as a subdirectory within C:\\jenkins_agent\\. Acronis True Image contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted openssl.cnf file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10139", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAcronis\u00bbTrue Image\u00bbVersion:2021cpe:2.3:a:acronis:true_image:2021:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.18%  +0.14 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-665 Improper Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/665/Improper-Initialization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/114757", "ref_desc": "VU#114757 - Acronis backup software contains multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/x0a4-YGJ6NcYt01g4ILXf8uWmGs.html"}]}
