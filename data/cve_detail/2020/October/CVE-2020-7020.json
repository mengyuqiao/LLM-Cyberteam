{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7020", "Description": "Elasticsearch versions before 6.8.13 and 7.9.2 contain a document disclosure flaw when Document or Field Level Security is used. Search queries do not properly preserve security permissions when executing certain complex queries. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents the attacker should not be able to view. This could result in an attacker gaining additional insight into potentially sensitive indices.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7020", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbElasticsearchVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.9.2cpe:2.3:a:elastic:elasticsearch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nElastic\u00bbElasticsearchVersions  before (<) 6.8.13cpe:2.3:a:elastic:elasticsearch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-270 Privilege Context Switching Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/270/Privilege-Context-Switching-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://staging-website.elastic.co/community/security/", "ref_desc": "Inloggen - Google AccountsPermissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201123-0001/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-7020 Elasticsearch Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-7-9-3-and-6-8-13-security-update/253033", "ref_desc": "Elastic Stack 7.9.3 and 6.8.13 Security Update - Announcements / Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
