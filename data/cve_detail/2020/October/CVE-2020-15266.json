{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15266", "Description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, when the `boxes` argument of `tf.image.crop_and_resize` has a very large value, the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ `nan` floating point value. Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later produces a segmentation fault. The issue is patched in eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808 and TensorFlow 2.4.0 will be released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15266", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersions  before (<) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-05-28  0.15%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-xwhf-g6j5-j5gc", "ref_desc": "Float cast overflow undefined behavior \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/42129", "ref_desc": "segfault in `tf.image.crop_and_resize` when `boxes` contains large value \u00b7 Issue #42129 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/42143/commits/3ade2efec2e90c6237de32a19680caaa3ebc2845", "ref_desc": "Fix segmentation fault in tf.image.crop_and_resize when boxes is inf or nan by yongtang \u00b7 Pull Request #42143 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
