{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15278", "Description": "Red Discord Bot before version 3.4.1 has an unauthorized privilege escalation exploit in the Mod module. This exploit allows Discord users with a high privilege level within the guild to bypass hierarchy checks when the application is in a specific condition that is beyond that user's control. By abusing this exploit, it is possible to perform destructive actions within the guild the user has high privileges in. This exploit has been fixed in version 3.4.1. As a workaround, unloading the Mod module with unload mod or, disabling the massban command with command disable global massban can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to 3.4.1 to completely patch this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15278", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCogboard\u00bbRed Discord BotVersions  before (<) 3.4.1cpe:2.3:a:cogboard:red_discord_bot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/releases/tag/3.4.1", "ref_desc": "Release v3.4.1 \u00b7 Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/security/advisories/GHSA-mp9m-g7qj-6vqr", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized privilege escalation in Mod module \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/commit/726bfd38adfdfaef760412a68e01447b470f438b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-mp9m-g7qj-6vqr \u00b7 Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot@726bfd3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
