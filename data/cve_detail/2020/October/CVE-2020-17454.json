{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17454", "Description": "WSO2 API Manager 3.1.0 and earlier has reflected XSS on the \"publisher\" component's admin interface. More precisely, it is possible to inject an XSS payload into the owner POST parameter, which does not filter user inputs. By putting an XSS payload in place of a valid Owner Name, a modal box appears that writes an error message concatenated to the injected payload (without any form of data encoding). This can also be exploited via CSRF.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17454", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nWso2\u00bbApi ManagerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:wso2:api_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-07  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/Security+Advisory+WSO2-2020-0843", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory WSO2-2020-0843 - WSO2 Platform Security - WSO2 DocumentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
