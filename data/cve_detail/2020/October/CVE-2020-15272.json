{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15272", "Description": "In the git-tag-annotation-action (open source GitHub Action) before version 1.0.1, an attacker can execute arbitrary (*) shell commands if they can control the value of [the `tag` input] or manage to alter the value of [the `GITHUB_REF` environment variable]. The problem has been patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't use the `tag` input you are most likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is protected by the GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be impossible. If you must use the `tag` input and cannot upgrade to `> 1.0.0` make sure that the value is not controlled by another Action.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15272", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGit-tag-annotation-action Project\u00bbGit-tag-annotation-actionVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:git-tag-annotation-action_project:git-tag-annotation-action:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/releases/tag/v1.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release Release v1.0.1 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/commit/9f30756375cc4b1b6c66f274fc9c591fa901455a", "ref_desc": "Fix shell injection bug \u00b7 ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action@9f30756 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/security/advisories/GHSA-hgx2-4pp9-357g", "ref_desc": "Shell-injection through Action input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
