{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15598", "Description": "Trustwave ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.4 allows denial of service via a special request. NOTE: The discoverer reports \"Trustwave has signaled they are disputing our claims.\" The CVE suggests that there is a security issue with how ModSecurity handles regular expressions that can result in a Denial of Service condition. The vendor does not consider this as a security issue because1) there is no default configuration issue here. An attacker would need to know that a rule using a potentially problematic regular expression was in place, 2) the attacker would need to know the basic nature of the regular expression itself to exploit any resource issues. It's well known that regular expression usage can be taxing on system resources regardless of the use case. It is up to the administrator to decide on when it is appropriate to trade resources for potential security benefit", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15598", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTrustwave\u00bbModsecurityVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.0.4cpe:2.3:a:trustwave:modsecurity:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.68%  0.57%  -1.11 \n 2  2024-02-09  1.99%  1.68%  -0.31 \n 3  2023-06-22  1.99%  1.99%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-13  1.65%  1.99%  +0.34 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  1.65%  +0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4765", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4765-1 modsecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://coreruleset.org/20200914/cve-2020-15598/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-15598 \u2013 ModSecurity v3 Affected By DoS (Severity HIGH) \u2013 OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule SetExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159185/ModSecurity-3.0.x-Denial-Of-Service.html", "ref_desc": "ModSecurity 3.0.x Denial Of Service \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.modsecurity.org", "ref_desc": "ModSecurity: Open Source Web Application FirewallProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Sep/32", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: ModSecurity v3 affected by DoS (CVE-2020-15598)Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
