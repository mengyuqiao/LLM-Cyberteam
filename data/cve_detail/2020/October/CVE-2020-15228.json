{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15228", "Description": "In the `@actions/core` npm module before version 1.2.6,`addPath` and `exportVariable` functions communicate with the Actions Runner over stdout by generating a string in a specific format. Workflows that log untrusted data to stdout may invoke these commands, resulting in the path or environment variables being modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. The runner will release an update that disables the `set-env` and `add-path` workflow commands in the near future. For now, users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.2.6` or later, and replace any instance of the `set-env` or `add-path` commands in their workflows with the new Environment File Syntax. Workflows and actions using the old commands or older versions of the toolkit will start to warn, then error out during workflow execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15228", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nToolkit Project\u00bbToolkit\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.2.6cpe:2.3:a:toolkit_project:toolkit:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.33%  +0.24 \n 2  2024-01-18  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.07%  -1.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159794/GitHub-Widespread-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "GitHub Widespread Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/actions/toolkit/security/advisories/GHSA-mfwh-5m23-j46w", "ref_desc": "`add-path` and `set-env` Runner commands are processed via stdout \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 actions/toolkit \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
