{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15239", "Description": "In xmpp-http-upload before version 0.4.0, when the GET method is attacked, attackers can read files which have a `.data` suffix and which are accompanied by a JSON file with the `.meta` suffix. This can lead to Information Disclosure and in some shared-hosting scenarios also to circumvention of authentication or other limitations on the outbound (GET) traffic. For example, in a scenario where a single server has multiple instances of the application running (with separate DATA_ROOT settings), an attacker who has knowledge about the directory structure is able to read files from any other instance to which the process has read access. If instances have individual authentication (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy, source IP based filtering) or other restrictions (such as quotas), attackers may circumvent those limits in such a scenario by using the Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other instances. If the associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is malicious, they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which are written are constrained to have the `.meta` and the `.data` suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the JSON with the Content-Type of the original request and the `.data` file will contain the payload. The issue is patched in version 0.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15239", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nXmpp-http-upload Project\u00bbXmpp-http-uploadVersions  before (<) 0.4.0cpe:2.3:a:xmpp-http-upload_project:xmpp-http-upload:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/horazont/xmpp-http-upload/pull/12", "ref_desc": "Simplify path handling, use safe_join by ChristianTacke \u00b7 Pull Request #12 \u00b7 horazont/xmpp-http-upload \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/horazont/xmpp-http-upload/commit/82056540191e89f0cd697c81f57714c00962ed75", "ref_desc": "Simplify path handling, use safe_join \u00b7 horazont/xmpp-http-upload@8205654 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/xmpp-http-upload/#history", "ref_desc": "xmpp-http-upload \u00b7 PyPIRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/horazont/xmpp-http-upload/security/advisories/GHSA-hwv5-w8gm-fq9f", "ref_desc": "Directory Traversal vulnerability in GET/PUT allows attackers to Disclose Information or Write Files via a crafted GET/PUT request \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 horazont/xmpp-http-upload \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
