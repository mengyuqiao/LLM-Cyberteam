{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17416", "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit Reader 10.0.0.35798. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JPEG2000 images. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
