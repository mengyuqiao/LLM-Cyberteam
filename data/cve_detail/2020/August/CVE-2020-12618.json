{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12618", "Description": "eM Client before 7.2.33412.0 automatically imported S/MIME certificates and thereby silently replaced existing ones. This allowed a man-in-the-middle attacker to obtain an email-validated S/MIME certificate from a trusted CA and replace the public key of the entity to be impersonated. This enabled the attacker to decipher further communication. The entire attack could be accomplished by sending a single email.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12618", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEmclient\u00bbEm ClientVersions  before (<) 7.2.33412.0cpe:2.3:a:emclient:em_client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2020/08/15/mailto-paper.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JdfLjql7_7tVEaApuIOLPbp8ypY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.emclient.com/release-history", "ref_desc": "Release History | eM ClientRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
