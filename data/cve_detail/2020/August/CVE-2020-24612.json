{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24612", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the selinux-policy (aka Reference Policy) package 3.14 through 2020-08-24 because the .config/Yubico directory is mishandled. Consequently, when SELinux is in enforced mode, pam-u2f is not allowed to read the user's U2F configuration file. If configured with the nouserok option (the default when configured by the authselect tool), and that file cannot be read, the second factor is disabled. An attacker with only the knowledge of the password can then log in, bypassing 2FA.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24612", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbSelinux-policyVersions  from including (>=) 3.14andup to, including, (<=) 2020-08-24cpe:2.3:a:fedoraproject:selinux-policy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fedora-selinux/selinux-policy/commit/71e1989028802c7875d3436fd3966c587fa383fb", "ref_desc": "Add file context for ~/.config/Yubico \u00b7 fedora-selinux/selinux-policy@71e1989 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860888", "ref_desc": "1860888 \u2013 [authselect] Obligatory 2FA doesn't workIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
