{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8911", "Description": "A padding oracle vulnerability exists in the AWS S3 Crypto SDK for GoLang versions prior to V2. The SDK allows users to encrypt files with AES-CBC without computing a Message Authentication Code (MAC), which then allows an attacker who has write access to the target's S3 bucket and can observe whether or not an endpoint with access to the key can decrypt a file, they can reconstruct the plaintext with (on average) 128*length (plaintext) queries to the endpoint, by exploiting CBC's ability to manipulate the bytes of the next block and PKCS5 padding errors. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt your files.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8911", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbAws S3 Crypto Sdk\u00bbForGolangVersions  before (<) 2.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:aws_s3_crypto_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:golang:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-12-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-f5pg-7wfw-84q9", "ref_desc": "CBC padding oracle issue in AWS S3 Crypto SDK for golang \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 google/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/updates-to-the-amazon-s3-encryption-client/?s=09", "ref_desc": "Updates to the Amazon S3 Encryption Client | AWS Developer BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zNXYfcYUT57OXWne54zNY0UqI0k.html"}]}
