{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15106", "Description": "In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, a large slice causes panic in decodeRecord method. The size of a record is stored in the length field of a WAL file and no additional validation is done on this data. Therefore, it is possible to forge an extremely large frame size that can unintentionally panic at the expense of any RAFT participant trying to decode the WAL.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15106", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEtcd\u00bbEtcdVersions  before (<) 3.3.23cpe:2.3:a:etcd:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEtcd\u00bbEtcdVersions  from including (>=) 3.4.0andbefore (<) 3.4.10cpe:2.3:a:etcd:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-p4g4-wgrh-qrg2", "ref_desc": "A large slice causes panic in decodeRecord method \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L6B6R43Y7M3DCHWK3L3UVGE2K6WWECMP/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: etcd-3.4.13-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fG2uYA3WLiBSdF-bkhI9ACMV0Jk.html"}]}
