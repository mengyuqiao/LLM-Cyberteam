{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15486", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Dr Trust ECG Pen 2.00.08 devices. Because the Bluetooth LE support is implemented without a requirement for pairing or security, any attacker can access the GATT server of the device and can sniff the data being broadcasted while a measurement is being done. Also, saved data can also be extracted over a Bluetooth connection. In addition, an attacker can launch a man-in-the-middle attack against data integrity.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15486", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDrtrust\u00bbElectrocardiogram Pen Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.00.08cpe:2.3:o:drtrust:electrocardiogram_pen_firmware:2.00.08:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Drtrust\u00bbElectrocardiogram Pen\u00bbVersion:2.00.08", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://payatu.com/advisory/lack-of-bluetooth-le-encryption-and-access-control-in-dr-trust-ecg-or-ekg-pen", "ref_desc": "Advisory | PayatuThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
