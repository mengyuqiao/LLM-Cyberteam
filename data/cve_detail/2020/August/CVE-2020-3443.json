{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3443", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and execute commands with higher privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of the System Operator role capabilities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in with the System Operator role, performing a series of actions, and then assuming a new higher privileged role. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform all actions associated with the privilege of the assumed role. If that role is an administrative role, the attacker would gain full access to the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3443", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSmart Software Manager On-prem\u00bbVersion:8-202004cpe:2.3:a:cisco:smart_software_manager_on-prem:8-202004:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.27%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-smart-priv-esca-nqwxXWBu", "ref_desc": "Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
