{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15138", "Description": "Prism is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The easing preview of the Previewers plugin has an XSS vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in Safari and Internet Explorer. This impacts all Safari and Internet Explorer users of Prism >=v1.1.0 that use the _Previewers_ plugin (>=v1.10.0) or the _Previewer: Easing_ plugin (v1.1.0 to v1.9.0). This problem is fixed in version 1.21.0. To workaround the issue without upgrading, disable the easing preview on all impacted code blocks. You need Prism v1.10.0 or newer to apply this workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15138", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nPrismjs\u00bbPreviewers\u00bbForPrismjsVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 1.21.0cpe:2.3:a:prismjs:previewers:*:*:*:*:*:prismjs:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbSafari\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbInternet Explorer\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.52%  0.36%  -0.15 \n 2  2024-07-31  0.51%  0.52%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-11  0.37%  0.51%  +0.14 \n 4  2024-01-28  0.52%  0.37%  -0.15 \n 5  2024-01-11  0.37%  0.52%  +0.15 \n 6  2023-12-26  0.38%  0.37%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-12-11  0.37%  0.38%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-07-14  0.35%  0.37%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-04-23  0.37%  0.35%  -0.02 \n 10  2023-03-14  0.36%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  18.52%  0.36%  -18.16 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-wvhm-4hhf-97x9", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability in the Previewers plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrismJS/prism \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://prismjs.com/plugins/previewers/#disabling-a-previewer", "ref_desc": "Previewers \u25b2 Prism pluginsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2506/commits/7bd7de05edf71112a3a77f87901a2409c9c5c20c", "ref_desc": "Previewers: Fixed XSS by RunDevelopment \u00b7 Pull Request #2506 \u00b7 PrismJS/prism \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
