{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6012", "Description": "ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware before version 1.0.713 copies files for the report from a directory with low privileges. A sophisticated timed attacker can replace those files with malicious or linked content, such as exploiting CVE-2020-0896 on unpatched systems or using symbolic links. This allows an unprivileged user to enable escalation of privilege via local access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6012", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCheckpoint\u00bbZonealarm Anti-ransomwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.713cpe:2.3:a:checkpoint:zonealarm_anti-ransomware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-08  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-05-24  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-04-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-11  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 \n 6  2023-02-01  0.89%  0.95%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.zonealarm.com/anti-ransomware/release-history", "ref_desc": "ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware release history official page | ZoneAlarmRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.zonealarm.com/software/extreme-security/release-history", "ref_desc": "ZoneAlarm Extreme Security release history official page | ZoneAlarmRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AS9NX8_AU_qfHDezFhJkQa09F7U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://danishcyberdefence.dk/blog/zonealarm-check-point", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-6012: Local Privilege Escalation in ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware by Check Point | Danish Cyber DefenceThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
