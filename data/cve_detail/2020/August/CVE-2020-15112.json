{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15112", "Description": "In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, it is possible to have an entry index greater then the number of entries in the ReadAll method in wal/wal.go. This could cause issues when WAL entries are being read during consensus as an arbitrary etcd consensus participant could go down from a runtime panic when reading the entry.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15112", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEtcd\u00bbEtcdVersions  before (<) 3.3.23cpe:2.3:a:etcd:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEtcd\u00bbEtcdVersions  from including (>=) 3.4.0andbefore (<) 3.4.10cpe:2.3:a:etcd:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/129/Improper-Validation-of-Array-Index.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L6B6R43Y7M3DCHWK3L3UVGE2K6WWECMP/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: etcd-3.4.13-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fG2uYA3WLiBSdF-bkhI9ACMV0Jk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-m332-53r6-2w93", "ref_desc": "An entry with large index causes panic in WAL ReadAll method \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
