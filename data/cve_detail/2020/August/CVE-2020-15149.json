{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15149", "Description": "NodeBB before version 1.14.3 has a bug introduced in version 1.12.2 in the validation logic that makes it possible to change the password of any user on a running NodeBB forum by sending a specially crafted socket.io call to the server. This could lead to a privilege escalation event due via an account takeover. As a workaround you may cherry-pick the following commit from the project's repository to your running instance of NodeBB: 16cee1b03ba3eee177834a1fdac4aa8a12b39d2a. This is fixed in version 1.14.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15149", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nNodebb\u00bbNodebbVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.2andbefore (<) 1.14.3cpe:2.3:a:nodebb:nodebb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.26%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.26%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://zeroauth.ltd/blog/2020/08/20/proof-of-concept-exploit-for-cve-2020-15149-nodebb-arbitrary-user-password-change/", "ref_desc": "Proof of Concept exploit for CVE-2020-15149 \u2013 NodeBB Arbitrary User Password Change \u2013 ZeroAuthThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-hr66-c8pg-5mg7", "ref_desc": "Account takeover via password change request \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159560/NodeBB-Forum-1.14.2-Account-Takeover.html", "ref_desc": "NodeBB Forum 1.14.2 Account Takeover \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/c2477d9d5ffc43e5ffeb537ea2ceb4ce9592aa39", "ref_desc": "fix: improper targetUid check during password change \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB@c2477d9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
