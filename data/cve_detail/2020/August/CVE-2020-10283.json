{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10283", "Description": "The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol presents authentication mechanisms on its version 2.0 however according to its documentation, in order to maintain backwards compatibility, GCS and autopilot negotiate the version via the AUTOPILOT_VERSION message. Since this negotiation depends on the answer, an attacker may craft packages in a way that hints the autopilot to adopt version 1.0 of MAVLink for the communication. Given the lack of authentication capabilities in such version of MAVLink (refer to CVE-2020-10282), attackers may use this method to bypass authentication capabilities and interact with the autopilot directly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10283", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDronecode\u00bbMicro Air Vehicle Link\u00bbVersion:1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:dronecode:micro_air_vehicle_link:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.61%  +0.22 \n 2  2024-07-27  0.31%  0.39%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-12-24  0.29%  0.31%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-13  0.30%  0.29%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-06-01  0.32%  0.30%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-05-06  0.29%  0.32%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-27  0.24%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/288/Authentication-Bypass-Using-an-Alternate-Path-or-Channel.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/3316", "ref_desc": "RVD#3316: No authentication in MAVLink protocol \u00b7 Issue #3316 \u00b7 aliasrobotics/RVD \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
