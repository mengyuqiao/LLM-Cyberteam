{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8904", "Description": "An arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerability in the trusted memory of Asylo exists in versions prior to 0.6.0. As the ecall_restore function fails to validate the range of the output_len pointer, an attacker can manipulate the tmp_output_len value and write to an arbitrary location in the trusted (enclave) memory. We recommend updating Asylo to version 0.6.0 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8904", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAsyloVersions  before (<) 0.6.0cpe:2.3:a:google:asylo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-823 Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/823/Use-of-Out-of-range-Pointer-Offset.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/e582f36ac49ee11a21d23ad6a30c333092e0a94e", "ref_desc": "Check for output_len range in ecall_restore \u00b7 google/asylo@e582f36 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
