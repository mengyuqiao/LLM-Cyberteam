{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1568", "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge PDF Reader improperly handles objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains malicious PDF content. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted PDF content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge PDF Reader handles objects in memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1568", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbEdge\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:microsoft:edge:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:N/AForX64When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:N/AForX86When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1607ForX64When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1607ForX86When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1709When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1803When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1809When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1903When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1909When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:2004When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2016When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2019\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "36.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  44.63%  36.04%  -8.59 \n 2  2024-08-24  48.29%  44.63%  -3.66 \n 3  2024-07-24  54.93%  48.29%  -6.65 \n 4  2024-05-19  48.29%  54.93%  +6.65 \n 5  2024-05-04  46.11%  48.29%  +2.18 \n 6  2024-04-16  44.75%  46.11%  +1.36 \n 7  2024-01-21  44.21%  44.75%  +0.55 \n 8  2024-01-10  1.14%  44.21%  +43.07 \n 9  2024-01-05  1.46%  1.14%  -0.32 \n 10  2023-12-21  1.51%  1.46%  -0.06 \n 11  2023-12-04  1.38%  1.51%  +0.13 \n 12  2023-11-05  1.61%  1.38%  -0.23 \n 13  2023-10-19  1.48%  1.61%  +0.13 \n 14  2023-10-04  2.65%  1.48%  -1.17 \n 15  2023-09-20  1.33%  2.65%  +1.32 \n 16  2023-07-24  1.26%  1.33%  +0.07 \n 17  2023-05-29  1.11%  1.26%  +0.15 \n 18  2023-05-03  1.18%  1.11%  -0.07 \n 19  2023-03-24  1.11%  1.18%  +0.08 \n 20  2023-03-12  1.13%  1.11%  -0.03 \n 21  2023-03-07  1.88%  1.13%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1568", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-1568 | Microsoft Edge PDF Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
