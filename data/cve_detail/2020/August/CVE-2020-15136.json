{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15136", "Description": "In ectd before versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23, gateway TLS authentication is only applied to endpoints detected in DNS SRV records. When starting a gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag. This has been fixed in versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23 with improved documentation and deprecation of the functionality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15136", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEtcdVersions  from including (>=) 3.4.0andbefore (<) 3.4.10cpe:2.3:a:redhat:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbEtcdVersions  from including (>=) 3.3.0andbefore (<) 3.3.23cpe:2.3:a:redhat:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.20%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-06-10  0.21%  0.29%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-05-26  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.12%  0.18%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-04-22  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-13  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/gateway.md", "ref_desc": "etcd/gateway.md at master \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-wr2v-9rpq-c35q", "ref_desc": "Gateway TLS authentication only applies to endpoints detected in DNS SRV records \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L6B6R43Y7M3DCHWK3L3UVGE2K6WWECMP/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: etcd-3.4.13-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fG2uYA3WLiBSdF-bkhI9ACMV0Jk.html"}]}
