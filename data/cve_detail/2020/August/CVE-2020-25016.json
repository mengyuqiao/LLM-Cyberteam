{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25016", "Description": "A safety violation was discovered in the rgb crate before 0.8.20 for Rust, leading to (for example) dereferencing of arbitrary pointers or disclosure of uninitialized memory. This occurs because structs can be treated as bytes for read and write operations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25016", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nRgb-rust Project\u00bbRgb-rustVersions  before (<) 0.8.20cpe:2.3:a:rgb-rust_project:rgb-rust:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.45%  +0.21 \n 2  2024-08-05  0.26%  0.24%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-01-02  0.25%  0.26%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-22  0.25%  0.25%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-06-10  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-15  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-04-05  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/843/Access-of-Resource-Using-Incompatible-Type-Type-Confusion-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0029.html", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kornelski/rust-rgb/issues/35", "ref_desc": "ComponentBytes is unsound \u00b7 Issue #35 \u00b7 kornelski/rust-rgb \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
