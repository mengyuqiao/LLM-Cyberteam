{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-22722", "Description": "Rapid Software LLC Rapid SCADA 5.8.0 is affected by a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the ScadaAgentSvc.exe executable file. An attacker can obtain admin privileges by placing a malicious .exe file in the application and renaming it ScadaAgentSvc.exe, which would result in executing the binary as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM in a Windows operating system. For example, an attacker can plant a reverse shell from a low privileged user account and by restarting the computer, the malicious service will be started as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM by giving the attacker full system access to the remote PC.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-22722", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRapidscada\u00bbRapid Scada\u00bbVersion:5.8.0cpe:2.3:a:rapidscada:rapid_scada:5.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://syhack.wordpress.com/2020/04/21/rapid-scada-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability/", "ref_desc": "Rapid SCADA Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability | Anandjons (@syh4ck) -\u0623\u0646\u0627\u0646\u062fExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
