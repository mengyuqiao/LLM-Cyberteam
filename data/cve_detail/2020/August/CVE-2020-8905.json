{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8905", "Description": "A buffer length validation vulnerability in Asylo versions prior to 0.6.0 allows an attacker to read data they should not have access to. The 'enc_untrusted_recvfrom' function generates a return value which is deserialized by 'MessageReader', and copied into three different 'extents'. The length of the third 'extents' is controlled by the outside world, and not verified on copy, allowing the attacker to force Asylo to copy trusted memory data into an untrusted buffer of significantly small length.. We recommend updating Asylo to version 0.6.0 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8905", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAsyloVersions  before (<) 0.6.0cpe:2.3:a:google:asylo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/299f804acbb95a612ab7c504d25ab908aa59ae93", "ref_desc": "Fix vulnerability in enc_untrusted_recvfrom \u00b7 google/asylo@299f804 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
