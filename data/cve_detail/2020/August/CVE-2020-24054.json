{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24054", "Description": "The administration console of the Moog EXO Series EXVF5C-2 and EXVP7C2-3 units features a 'statusbroadcast' command that can spawn a given process repeatedly at a certain time interval as 'root'. One of the limitations of this feature is that it only takes a path to a binary without arguments; however, this can be circumvented using special shell variables, such as '${IFS}'. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as 'root' on the units.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24054", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMoog\u00bbExvf5c-2 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:moog:exvf5c-2_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Moog\u00bbExvf5c-2\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMoog\u00bbExvp7c2-3 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:moog:exvp7c2-3_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Moog\u00bbExvp7c2-3\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "9.43% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.99%  9.43%  +8.45 \n 2  2024-07-28  0.78%  0.99%  +0.21 \n 3  2023-12-25  0.76%  0.78%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-08  0.54%  0.76%  +0.22 \n 5  2023-07-14  0.39%  0.54%  +0.15 \n 6  2023-06-02  0.42%  0.39%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-05-07  0.38%  0.42%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-03-28  0.31%  0.38%  +0.07 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.31%  -0.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ioactive.com/moog-exo-series-multiple-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "Moog EXO Series Multiple Vulnerabilities | IOActiveThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CmiZTwX0qPZ1j0Mg2ZmQ7VVOX5s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://ioac.tv/3hy1xu6", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WaxEhIpzDooNt5ncBZdwLjmkYAQ.html"}]}
