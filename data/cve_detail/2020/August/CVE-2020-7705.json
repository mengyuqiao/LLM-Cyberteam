{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7705", "Description": "This affects the package MintegralAdSDK from 0.0.0. The SDK distributed by the company contains malicious functionality that tracks any URL opened by the app and reports it back to the company, along with performing advertisement attribution fraud. Mintegral can remotely activate hooks on the UIApplication, openURL, SKStoreProductViewController, loadProductWithParameters and NSURLProtocol methods along with anti-debug and proxy detection protection. If those hooks are active MintegralAdSDK sends obfuscated data about every opened URL in an application to their servers. Note that the malicious functionality is enabled even if the SDK was not enabled to serve ads.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7705", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMintegral\u00bbMintegraladsdkVersions  from including (>=) 0.0.0cpe:2.3:a:mintegral:mintegraladsdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-28  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-13  0.14%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-05-10  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-31  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1021 Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1021/Improper-Restriction-of-Rendered-UI-Layers-or-Frames.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/", "ref_desc": "SourMint: malicious code, ad fraud, and data leak in iOS | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/research/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/", "ref_desc": "SourMint Malicious SDK | SnykThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/J1hWdbUBtDykisykXTciyFE_IyQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-COCOAPODS-MINTEGRALADSDK-598852", "ref_desc": "Malicious \udb40\udd6e\udb40\udd70\udb40\udd6dPackage in mintegraladsdk | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
