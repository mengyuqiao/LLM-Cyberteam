{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24051", "Description": "The Moog EXO Series EXVF5C-2 and EXVP7C2-3 units support the ONVIF interoperability IP-based physical security protocol, which requires authentication for some of its operations. It was found that the authentication check for those ONVIF operations can be bypassed. An attacker can abuse this issue to execute privileged operations without authentication, for instance, to create a new Administrator user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24051", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMoog\u00bbExvf5c-2 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:moog:exvf5c-2_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Moog\u00bbExvf5c-2\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMoog\u00bbExvp7c2-3 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:moog:exvp7c2-3_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Moog\u00bbExvp7c2-3\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.62%  1.16%  +0.54 \n 2  2024-07-28  0.49%  0.62%  +0.13 \n 3  2023-12-25  0.40%  0.49%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-07-14  0.29%  0.40%  +0.11 \n 5  2023-06-02  0.32%  0.29%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-05-07  0.29%  0.32%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-28  0.23%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ioactive.com/moog-exo-series-multiple-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "Moog EXO Series Multiple Vulnerabilities | IOActiveThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CmiZTwX0qPZ1j0Mg2ZmQ7VVOX5s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://ioac.tv/3hy1xu6", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WaxEhIpzDooNt5ncBZdwLjmkYAQ.html"}]}
