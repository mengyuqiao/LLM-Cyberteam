{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15147", "Description": "Red Discord Bot before versions 3.3.12 and 3.4 has a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the Streams module. This exploit allows Discord users with specifically crafted \"going live\" messages to inject code into the Streams module's going live message. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. As a workaround, unloading the Trivia module with `unload streams` can render this exploit not accessible. It is highly recommended updating to 3.3.12 or 3.4 to completely patch this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15147", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCogboard\u00bbRed Discord BotVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.3.11cpe:2.3:a:cogboard:red_discord_bot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.13%  1.80%  +0.67 \n 2  2023-03-07  4.57%  1.13%  -3.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/security/advisories/GHSA-7257-96vg-qf6x", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution in Streams module \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/pull/4183/commits/e269ea0d3bc88417163c18431b1df38a9be92bfc", "ref_desc": "[Streams] Allow for consume all on messages by Kowlin \u00b7 Pull Request #4183 \u00b7 Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/pull/4183", "ref_desc": "[Streams] Allow for consume all on messages by Kowlin \u00b7 Pull Request #4183 \u00b7 Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
