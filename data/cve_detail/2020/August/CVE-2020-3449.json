{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3449", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) additional paths feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent authorized users from monitoring the BGP status and cause the BGP process to stop processing new updates, resulting in a denial of service (DOS) condition. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect calculation of lexicographical order when displaying additional path information within Cisco IOS XR Software, which causes an infinite loop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific BGP update from a BGP neighbor peer session of an affected device; an authorized user must then issue a show bgp command for the vulnerability to be exploited. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent authorized users from properly monitoring the BGP status and prevent BGP from processing new updates, resulting in outdated information in the routing and forwarding tables.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3449", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 7.2.0andbefore (<) 7.2.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  before (<) 7.1.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 7.3.0andbefore (<) 7.3.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-21  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-03  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-24  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bgp-ErKEqAer", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software Additional Paths Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
