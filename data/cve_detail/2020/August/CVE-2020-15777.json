{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15777", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Maven Extension plugin before 1.6 for Gradle Enterprise. The extension uses a socket connection to send serialized Java objects. Deserialization is not restricted to an allow-list, thus allowing an attacker to achieve code execution via a malicious deserialization gadget chain. The socket is not bound exclusively to localhost. The port this socket is assigned to is randomly selected and is not intentionally exposed to the public (either by design or documentation). This could potentially be used to achieve remote code execution and local privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15777", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGradle\u00bbMaven\u00bbForGradleVersions  before (<) 1.6cpe:2.3:a:gradle:maven:*:*:*:*:*:gradle:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.28%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-10-04  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-12  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 5  2023-05-16  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.89%  0.11%  -1.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gradle.com/advisory/CVE-2020-15777", "ref_desc": "Gradle Enterprise - Security Advisories | Gradle Inc.Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/#1_6", "ref_desc": "Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension User Manual | Gradle Enterprise DocsRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
