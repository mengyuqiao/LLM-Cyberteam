{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17376", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Guest.migrate in virt/libvirt/guest.py in OpenStack Nova before 19.3.1, 20.x before 20.3.1, and 21.0.0. By performing a soft reboot of an instance that has previously undergone live migration, a user may gain access to destination host devices that share the same paths as host devices previously referenced by the virtual machine on the source host. This can include block devices that map to different Cinder volumes at the destination than at the source. Only deployments allowing host-based connections (for instance, root and ephemeral devices) are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17376", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nOpenstack\u00bbNovaVersions  before (<) 19.3.1cpe:2.3:a:openstack:nova:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbNovaVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.0andbefore (<) 20.3.1cpe:2.3:a:openstack:nova:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbNova\u00bbVersion:21.0.0cpe:2.3:a:openstack:nova:21.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.25%  +0.08 \n 2  2023-07-19  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1890501", "ref_desc": "Bug #1890501 \u201cSoft reboot after live-migration reverts instance ...\u201d : Bugs : OpenStack Compute (nova)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2020-006.html", "ref_desc": "OpenStack Docs: OSSA-2020-006: Live migration fails to update persistent domain XMLPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/08/25/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [OSSA-2020-006] Nova: Live migration fails to update persistent domain XML (CVE-2020-17376)Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
