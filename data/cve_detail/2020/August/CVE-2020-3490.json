{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3490", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to conduct directory traversal attacks and obtain read access to sensitive files on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read files on the underlying operating system with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative privileges on the affected system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3490", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbVision Dynamic Signage Director\u00bbVersion:6.2.0UpdateSP4cpe:2.3:a:cisco:vision_dynamic_signage_director:6.2.0:sp4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.30%  0.42%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-05-06  0.31%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-08-30  0.22%  0.31%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-06-22  0.13%  0.22%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cvdsd-pathtrv-5tLJRrFn", "ref_desc": "Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director Path Traversal VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
