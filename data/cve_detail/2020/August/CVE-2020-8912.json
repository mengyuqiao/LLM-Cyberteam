{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8912", "Description": "A vulnerability in the in-band key negotiation exists in the AWS S3 Crypto SDK for GoLang versions prior to V2. An attacker with write access to the targeted bucket can change the encryption algorithm of an object in the bucket, which can then allow them to change AES-GCM to AES-CTR. Using this in combination with a decryption oracle can reveal the authentication key used by AES-GCM as decrypting the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as an algebraic equation. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt your files.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8912", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbAws S3 Crypto Sdk\u00bbForGolangVersions  before (<) 2.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:aws_s3_crypto_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:golang:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-7f33-f4f5-xwgw", "ref_desc": "In-band key negotiation issue in AWS S3 Crypto SDK for golang \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 google/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/updates-to-the-amazon-s3-encryption-client/?s=09", "ref_desc": "Updates to the Amazon S3 Encryption Client | AWS Developer BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zNXYfcYUT57OXWne54zNY0UqI0k.html"}]}
