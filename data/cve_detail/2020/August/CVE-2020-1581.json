{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1581", "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office Click-to-Run (C2R) components handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could elevate privileges. The attacker would need to already have the ability to execute code on the system.\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application on the victim system.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office Click-to-Run (C2R) components handle objects in memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1581", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbOffice\u00bbVersion:2019cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2019:*:*:*:*:-:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbOffice\u00bbVersion:2013    Click-to-runEditioncpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2013:*:*:*:click-to-run:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bb365 Apps\u00bbVersion:N/A    EnterpriseEditioncpe:2.3:a:microsoft:365_apps:-:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-05-04  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-04-16  0.14%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-01-21  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-10  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-01-05  0.11%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-12-21  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 8  2023-12-04  0.14%  0.12%  -0.02 \n 9  2023-09-04  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-08-06  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-06-26  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 12  2023-05-29  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 13  2023-05-03  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 14  2023-03-24  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 15  2023-03-07  2.63%  0.08%  -2.55 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1581", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-1581 | Microsoft Office Click-to-Run Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
