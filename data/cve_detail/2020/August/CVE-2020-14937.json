{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14937", "Description": "Memory access out of buffer boundaries issues was discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the SNMP BER encoder/decoder. The length of provided input/output buffers is insufficiently verified during the encoding and decoding of data. This may lead to out-of-bounds buffer read or write access in BER decoding and encoding functions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14937", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  from including (>=) 4.4andup to, including, (<=) 4.5cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.95% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.60%  0.95%  +0.35 \n 2  2024-07-25  0.47%  0.60%  +0.13 \n 3  2023-12-22  0.39%  0.47%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-07-11  0.28%  0.39%  +0.11 \n 5  2023-05-30  0.30%  0.28%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-05-04  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-25  0.22%  0.27%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/1354", "ref_desc": "Out of bounds memory access in SNMP BER decoder/encoder routines \u00b7 Issue #1354 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mAkJBVZNv5PMVwLojru0njH38zEXpWui/view?usp=sharing", "ref_desc": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mAkJBVZNv5PMVwLojru0njH38zEXpWui/view?usp=sharingThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
