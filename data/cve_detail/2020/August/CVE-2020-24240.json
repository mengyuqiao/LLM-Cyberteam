{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24240", "Description": "GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c (called from gram_lex) when a '\\0' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24240", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbBison\u00bbVersion:3.7cpe:2.3:a:gnu:bison:3.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-01  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/akimd/bison/compare/v3.7...v3.7.1", "ref_desc": "Comparing v3.7...v3.7.1 \u00b7 akimd/bison \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/akimd/bison/commit/be95a4fe2951374676efc9454ffee8638faaf68d", "ref_desc": "scanner: don't crash on strings containing a NUL byte \u00b7 akimd/bison@be95a4f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-bison/2020-07/msg00051.html", "ref_desc": "[bison 3.7] Bug ReportMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
