{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15132", "Description": "In Sulu before versions 1.6.35, 2.0.10, and 2.1.1, when the \"Forget password\" feature on the login screen is used, Sulu asks the user for a username or email address. If the given string is not found, a response with a `400` error code is returned, along with a error message saying that this user name does not exist. This enables attackers to retrieve valid usernames. Also, the response of the \"Forgot Password\" request returns the email address to which the email was sent, if the operation was successful. This information should not be exposed, as it can be used to gather email addresses. This problem was fixed in versions 1.6.35, 2.0.10 and 2.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15132", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSulu\u00bbSuluVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andbefore (<) 2.1.1cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSulu\u00bbSuluVersions  before (<) 1.6.35cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSulu\u00bbSuluVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.10cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-04-21  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-12  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sulu/sulu/security/advisories/GHSA-wfm4-pq59-wg6r", "ref_desc": "Reset Password / Login vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sulu/sulu \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
