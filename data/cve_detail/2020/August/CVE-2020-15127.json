{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15127", "Description": "In Contour ( Ingress controller for Kubernetes) before version 1.7.0, a bad actor can shut down all instances of Envoy, essentially killing the entire ingress data plane. GET requests to /shutdown on port 8090 of the Envoy pod initiate Envoy's shutdown procedure. The shutdown procedure includes flipping the readiness endpoint to false, which removes Envoy from the routing pool. When running Envoy (For example on the host network, pod spec hostNetwork=true), the shutdown manager's endpoint is accessible to anyone on the network that can reach the Kubernetes node that's running Envoy. There is no authentication in place that prevents a rogue actor on the network from shutting down Envoy via the shutdown manager endpoint. Successful exploitation of this issue will lead to bad actors shutting down all instances of Envoy, essentially killing the entire ingress data plane. This is fixed in version 1.7.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15127", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nProjectcontour\u00bbContour\u00bbForKubernetesVersions  before (<) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:projectcontour:contour:*:*:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-21  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-12  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/releases/tag/v1.7.0", "ref_desc": "Release Contour 1.7.0 \u00b7 projectcontour/contour \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/security/advisories/GHSA-mjp8-x484-pm3r", "ref_desc": "Ingress data plane (Envoy deployment) is vulnerable to DOS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 projectcontour/contour \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
