{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7352", "Description": "The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment. Due to the software shipping with embedded, static RSA private key, an attacker with this key material and local user permissions can effectively send any operating system command to the service for execution in this elevated context. The service listens for such commands on a locally-bound network port, localhost:9978. A Metasploit module has been published which exploits this vulnerability. This issue affects the 2.0.x branch of the software (2.0.12 and earlier) as well as the 1.2.x branch (1.2.64 and earlier). A fix was issued for the 2.0.x branch of the affected software.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7352", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGOG\u00bbGalaxy\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.2.64cpe:2.3:a:gog:galaxy:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nGOG\u00bbGalaxy\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.0.12cpe:2.3:a:gog:galaxy:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.27%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-04-04  0.16%  0.14%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  2.58%  0.16%  -2.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/13444", "ref_desc": "GOG Galaxy Client Privilege Escalation Module by jtesta \u00b7 Pull Request #13444 \u00b7 rapid7/metasploit-framework \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/", "ref_desc": "Positron SecurityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
