{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15114", "Description": "In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, the etcd gateway is a simple TCP proxy to allow for basic service discovery and access. However, it is possible to include the gateway address as an endpoint. This results in a denial of service, since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop of requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to accept connections on the gateway.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15114", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEtcdVersions  from including (>=) 3.4.0andbefore (<) 3.4.10cpe:2.3:a:redhat:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbEtcdVersions  from including (>=) 3.3.0andbefore (<) 3.3.23cpe:2.3:a:redhat:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/772/Missing-Release-of-Resource-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L6B6R43Y7M3DCHWK3L3UVGE2K6WWECMP/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: etcd-3.4.13-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fG2uYA3WLiBSdF-bkhI9ACMV0Jk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-2xhq-gv6c-p224", "ref_desc": "Gateway can include itself as an endpoint resulting in resource exhaustion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
