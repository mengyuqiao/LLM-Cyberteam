{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13151", "Description": "Aerospike Community Edition 4.9.0.5 allows for unauthenticated submission and execution of user-defined functions (UDFs), written in Lua, as part of a database query. It attempts to restrict code execution by disabling os.execute() calls, but this is insufficient. Anyone with network access can use a crafted UDF to execute arbitrary OS commands on all nodes of the cluster at the permission level of the user running the Aerospike service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13151", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAerospike\u00bbAerospike Server\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.6.0.1andbefore (<) 4.6.0.19cpe:2.3:a:aerospike:aerospike_server:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nAerospike\u00bbAerospike Server\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.8.0.1andbefore (<) 4.8.0.13cpe:2.3:a:aerospike:aerospike_server:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nAerospike\u00bbAerospike Server\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.7.0.1andbefore (<) 4.7.0.17cpe:2.3:a:aerospike:aerospike_server:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nAerospike\u00bbAerospike Server\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.9.0.1andbefore (<) 4.9.0.10cpe:2.3:a:aerospike:aerospike_server:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nAerospike\u00bbAerospike Server\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0.1andbefore (<) 5.0.0.7cpe:2.3:a:aerospike:aerospike_server:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nAerospike\u00bbAerospike Server\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  before (<) 4.5.3.21cpe:2.3:a:aerospike:aerospike_server:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  84.92%  96.35%  +11.43 \n 2  2024-09-30  85.26%  84.92%  -0.34 \n 3  2024-07-12  84.50%  85.26%  +0.76 \n 4  2024-06-09  82.14%  84.50%  +2.36 \n 5  2024-05-25  81.99%  82.14%  +0.15 \n 6  2024-04-22  82.12%  81.99%  -0.13 \n 7  2024-04-04  73.75%  82.12%  +8.38 \n 8  2024-03-02  70.77%  73.75%  +2.98 \n 9  2024-02-13  67.62%  70.77%  +3.14 \n 10  2023-12-24  71.27%  67.62%  -3.65 \n 11  2023-12-09  74.41%  71.27%  -3.14 \n 12  2023-11-22  72.44%  74.41%  +1.97 \n 13  2023-10-23  71.25%  72.44%  +1.19 \n 14  2023-09-22  73.52%  71.25%  -2.27 \n 15  2023-08-23  71.84%  73.52%  +1.69 \n 16  2023-08-09  73.32%  71.84%  -1.48 \n 17  2023-07-25  74.88%  73.32%  -1.56 \n 18  2023-05-08  75.18%  74.88%  -0.30 \n 19  2023-04-21  74.90%  75.18%  +0.28 \n 20  2023-03-26  74.01%  74.90%  +0.89 \n 21  2023-03-12  70.42%  74.01%  +3.59 \n 22  2023-03-07  92.21%  70.42%  -21.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.aerospike.com/docs/operations/configure/security/access-control/index.html#create-users-and-assign-roles", "ref_desc": "Configuring Access ControlExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.aerospike.com/download/server/notes.html#5.1.0.3", "ref_desc": "Aerospike Server CE Release Note | Download | AerospikeRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160451/Aerospike-Database-UDF-Lua-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Aerospike Database UDF Lua Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://b4ny4n.github.io/network-pentest/2020/08/01/cve-2020-13151-poc-aerospike.html", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-13151 POC: Aerospike Server Host Command Execution | -pentest notes-Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.aerospike.com/enterprise/download/server/notes.html#5.1.0.3", "ref_desc": "Aerospike Server EE Release Note | Enterprise Download | AerospikeRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160106/Aerospike-Database-5.1.0.3-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Aerospike Database 5.1.0.3 Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
