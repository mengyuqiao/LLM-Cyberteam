{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3434", "Description": "A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to stop the AnyConnect process, causing a DoS condition on the device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3434", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAnyconnect Secure Mobility Client\u00bbForWindowsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.9.00086cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.40%  0.04%  -1.36 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-dos-feXq4tAV", "ref_desc": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
