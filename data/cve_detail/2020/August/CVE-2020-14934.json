{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14934", "Description": "Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the SNMP agent. The function parsing the received SNMP request does not verify the input message's requested variables against the capacity of the internal SNMP engine buffer. If the number of variables in the request exceeds the allocated buffer, a memory write out of the buffer boundaries occurs. This write operation provides a possibility to overwrite other variables allocated in the .bss section by the application. Because the sender of the frame is in control of the content that will be written beyond the buffer limits, and there is no strict process memory separation, this issue may allow overwriting of sensitive memory areas of an IoT device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14934", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  from including (>=) 4.4andup to, including, (<=) 4.5cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.47%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-07-25  0.33%  0.42%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-12-22  0.28%  0.33%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-07-11  0.28%  0.28%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-05-30  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-04  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-25  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NIf0Y0S47Lu85uSi29kt9tgSh0jYZYfj/view?usp=sharing", "ref_desc": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NIf0Y0S47Lu85uSi29kt9tgSh0jYZYfj/view?usp=sharingThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/1352", "ref_desc": "Buffer overflow in .bss section due to SNMP request overflow \u00b7 Issue #1352 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
