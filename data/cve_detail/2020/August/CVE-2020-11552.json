{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11552", "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before build 6003 because it does not properly enforce user privileges associated with a Certificate dialog. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to escalate privileges on a Windows host. An attacker does not require any privilege on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. One option is the self-service option on the Windows login screen. Upon selecting this option, the thick-client software is launched, which connects to a remote ADSelfService Plus server to facilitate self-service operations. An unauthenticated attacker having physical access to the host could trigger a security alert by supplying a self-signed SSL certificate to the client. The View Certificate option from the security alert allows an attacker to export a displayed certificate to a file. This can further cascade to a dialog that can open Explorer as SYSTEM. By navigating from Explorer to \\windows\\system32, cmd.exe can be launched as a SYSTEM.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11552", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nZohocorp\u00bbManageengine Adselfservice PlusVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.8cpe:2.3:a:zohocorp:manageengine_adselfservice_plus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZohocorp\u00bbManageengine Adselfservice Plus\u00bbVersion:6.0cpe:2.3:a:zohocorp:manageengine_adselfservice_plus:6.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZohocorp\u00bbManageengine Adselfservice Plus\u00bbVersion:6.0Update6000cpe:2.3:a:zohocorp:manageengine_adselfservice_plus:6.0:6000:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZohocorp\u00bbManageengine Adselfservice Plus\u00bbVersion:6.0Update6001cpe:2.3:a:zohocorp:manageengine_adselfservice_plus:6.0:6001:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZohocorp\u00bbManageengine Adselfservice Plus\u00bbVersion:6.0Update6002cpe:2.3:a:zohocorp:manageengine_adselfservice_plus:6.0:6002:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "9.68% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  10.59%  9.68%  -0.91 \n 2  2024-07-18  10.27%  10.59%  +0.33 \n 3  2024-06-15  11.02%  10.27%  -0.75 \n 4  2024-05-31  10.33%  11.02%  +0.69 \n 5  2024-04-28  7.66%  10.33%  +2.67 \n 6  2024-04-10  6.25%  7.66%  +1.41 \n 7  2024-03-08  8.57%  6.25%  -2.32 \n 8  2024-02-01  6.71%  8.57%  +1.86 \n 9  2023-12-30  5.72%  6.71%  +1.00 \n 10  2023-11-28  4.20%  5.72%  +1.52 \n 11  2023-10-13  3.81%  4.20%  +0.39 \n 12  2023-09-28  4.49%  3.81%  -0.68 \n 13  2023-08-29  3.22%  4.49%  +1.27 \n 14  2023-04-27  2.58%  3.22%  +0.64 \n 15  2023-03-18  2.07%  2.58%  +0.51 \n 16  2023-03-07  10.21%  2.07%  -8.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158820/ManageEngine-ADSelfService-Plus-6000-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus 6000 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.manageengine.com", "ref_desc": "ManageEngine - IT Operations and Service Management SoftwareVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BrCFhqwlqHtB3hd-X5uTNXwjeME.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Aug/4", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus \u2013 Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pitstop.manageengine.com/portal/en/community/topic/adselfservice-plus-6003-release-faceid-support", "ref_desc": "ADSelfService Plus 6003 Release - FaceID SupportRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48739", "ref_desc": "ManageEngine ADSelfService Build prior to 6003 - Remote Code Execution (Unauthenticated) - Java webapps ExploitExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Aug/6", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Re: [FD] ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus \u2013 Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
