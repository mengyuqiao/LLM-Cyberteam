{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3500", "Description": "A vulnerability in the IPv6 implementation of Cisco StarOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to an affected device with the goal of reaching the vulnerable section of the input buffer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3500", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbStarosVersions  before (<) 21.18.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:staros:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVirtualized Packet Core-single Instance\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 5500\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 5700\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-03  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-24  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr5k-ipv6-dos-ce3zhF8m", "ref_desc": "Cisco StarOS IPv6 Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
