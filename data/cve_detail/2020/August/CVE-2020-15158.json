{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15158", "Description": "In libIEC61850 before version 1.4.3, when a message with COTP message length field with value < 4 is received an integer underflow will happen leading to heap buffer overflow. This can cause an application crash or on some platforms even the execution of remote code. If your application is used in open networks or there are untrusted nodes in the network it is highly recommend to apply the patch. This was patched with commit 033ab5b. Users of version 1.4.x should upgrade to version 1.4.3 when available. As a workaround changes of commit 033ab5b can be applied to older versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15158", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nMz-automation\u00bbLibiec61850Versions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.4.3cpe:2.3:a:mz-automation:libiec61850:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.98% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.22%  0.98%  -0.23 \n 2  2024-08-19  1.41%  1.22%  -0.19 \n 3  2024-07-17  1.72%  1.41%  -0.31 \n 4  2024-06-30  1.30%  1.72%  +0.42 \n 5  2024-06-15  1.24%  1.30%  +0.06 \n 6  2024-05-13  1.37%  1.24%  -0.13 \n 7  2024-01-14  1.40%  1.37%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-12-30  1.37%  1.40%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-08-02  1.30%  1.37%  +0.07 \n 10  2023-05-12  1.21%  1.30%  +0.08 \n 11  2023-04-29  0.86%  1.21%  +0.36 \n 12  2023-04-02  0.87%  0.86%  -0.02 \n 13  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.87%  -1.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mz-automation/libiec61850/issues/250", "ref_desc": "Possible heap buffer overflow when COTP message with invalid size is received \u00b7 Issue #250 \u00b7 mz-automation/libiec61850 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mz-automation/libiec61850/commit/033ab5b6488250c8c3b838f25a7cbc3e099230bb", "ref_desc": "- COTP: fixed possible heap buffer overflow when handling message wit\u2026 \u00b7 mz-automation/libiec61850@033ab5b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mz-automation/libiec61850/security/advisories/GHSA-pq77-fmf7-hjw8", "ref_desc": "Possible heap buffer overflow when COTP message with invalid size is received \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mz-automation/libiec61850 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
