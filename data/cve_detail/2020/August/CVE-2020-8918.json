{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8918", "Description": "An improperly initialized 'migrationAuth' value in Google's go-tpm TPM1.2 library versions prior to 0.3.0 can lead an eavesdropping attacker to discover the auth value for a key created with CreateWrapKey. An attacker listening in on the channel can collect both 'encUsageAuth' and 'encMigrationAuth', and then can calculate 'usageAuth ^ encMigrationAuth' as the 'migrationAuth' can be guessed for all keys created with CreateWrapKey. TPM2.0 is not impacted by this. We recommend updating your library to 0.3.0 or later, or, if you cannot update, to call CreateWrapKey with a random 20-byte value for 'migrationAuth'.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8918", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbGo-tpmVersions  before (<) 0.3.0cpe:2.3:a:google:go-tpm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-12-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-665 Improper Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/665/Improper-Initialization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/go-tpm/security/advisories/GHSA-5x29-3hr9-6wpw", "ref_desc": "TPM 1.2 key authorization values vulnerable to TPM transport eavesdropper \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 google/go-tpm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
