{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3566", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust process memory of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient queue management for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory exhaustion, resulting in instability of other processes. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3566", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xr\u00bbVersion:6.4.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:6.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9001\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9006\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9010\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9901\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9904\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9906\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9910\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9912\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9922\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.33%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-05-15  0.29%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-04-05  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.28%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-dvmrp-memexh-dSmpdvfz", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software DVMRP Memory Exhaustion VulnerabilityVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/M-lFTAa_b-tN535fum0_kmN8flo.html"}]}
