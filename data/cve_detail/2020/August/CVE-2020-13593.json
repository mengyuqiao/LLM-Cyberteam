{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13593", "Description": "The Bluetooth Low Energy Secure Manager Protocol (SMP) implementation in Texas Instruments SimpleLink SIMPLELINK-CC2640R2-SDK through 2.2.3 allows the Diffie-Hellman check during the Secure Connection pairing to be skipped if the Link Layer encryption setup is performed earlier. An attacker in radio range can achieve arbitrary read/write access to protected GATT service data, cause a denial of service, or possibly control a device's function by establishing an encrypted session with an unauthenticated Long Term Key (LTK).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13593", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nTI\u00bbSimplelink-cc2640r2 Software Development KitVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.3cpe:2.3:a:ti:simplelink-cc2640r2_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-07  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-07  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-12  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.ti.com/tool/BLE-STACK", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hSsIIzAqxmkuYoByA3kOyqOL1YE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://asset-group.github.io/cves.html", "ref_desc": "ASSET Research Group: CVEsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pG27Dv7ggcctyl6bT7j8_2axuOw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/", "ref_desc": "ASSET Research Group: SweynToothThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vBuJIzkJxMxRc1tum7_0USOaEQk.html"}]}
