{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5415", "Description": "Concourse, versions prior to 6.3.1 and 6.4.1, in installations which use the GitLab auth connector, is vulnerable to identity spoofing by way of configuring a GitLab account with the same full name as another user who is granted access to a Concourse team. GitLab groups do not have this vulnerability, so GitLab users may be moved into groups which are then configured in the Concourse team.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5415", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPivotal Software\u00bbConcourseVersions  before (<) 6.3.1cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:concourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbConcourseVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.0andbefore (<) 6.4.1cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:concourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-04-28  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-19  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/concourse/concourse/security/advisories/GHSA-627p-rr78-99rj", "ref_desc": "GitLab auth uses full name instead of username as user ID, allowing impersonation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 concourse/concourse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2020-5415", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-5415: Concourse's GitLab auth allows impersonation | Security | VMware TanzuThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
