{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15113", "Description": "In etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10, certain directory paths are created (etcd data directory and the directory path when provided to automatically generate self-signed certificates for TLS connections with clients) with restricted access permissions (700) by using the os.MkdirAll. This function does not perform any permission checks when a given directory path exists already. A possible workaround is to ensure the directories have the desired permission (700).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15113", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEtcd\u00bbEtcdVersions  before (<) 3.3.23cpe:2.3:a:etcd:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEtcd\u00bbEtcdVersions  from including (>=) 3.4.0andbefore (<) 3.4.10cpe:2.3:a:etcd:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L6B6R43Y7M3DCHWK3L3UVGE2K6WWECMP/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: etcd-3.4.13-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fG2uYA3WLiBSdF-bkhI9ACMV0Jk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-chh6-ppwq-jh92", "ref_desc": "Directories created via os.MkdirAll are not checked for permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
