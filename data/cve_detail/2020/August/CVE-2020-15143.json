{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15143", "Description": "In SyliusResourceBundle before versions 1.3.14, 1.4.7, 1.5.2 and 1.6.4, rrequest parameters injected inside an expression evaluated by `symfony/expression-language` package haven't been sanitized properly. This allows the attacker to access any public service by manipulating that request parameter, allowing for Remote Code Execution. This issue has been patched for versions 1.3.14, 1.4.7, 1.5.2 and 1.6.4. Versions prior to 1.3 were not patched.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15143", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSylius\u00bbSyliusresourcebundleVersions  from including (>=) 1.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.6.3cpe:2.3:a:sylius:syliusresourcebundle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusresourcebundleVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.5.1cpe:2.3:a:sylius:syliusresourcebundle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusresourcebundleVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.4.6cpe:2.3:a:sylius:syliusresourcebundle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusresourcebundleVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.13cpe:2.3:a:sylius:syliusresourcebundle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.51%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-09-28  0.31%  0.42%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-06-08  0.31%  0.31%  0.00 \n 4  2024-05-06  0.23%  0.31%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-12-23  0.22%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.22%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-917 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/917/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-Expre.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusResourceBundle/security/advisories/GHSA-p4pj-9g59-4ppv", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution in ParametersParser while using request parameters inside expression language \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sylius/SyliusResourceBundle \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
