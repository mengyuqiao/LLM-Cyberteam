{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-20150", "Description": "In TreasuryXpress 19191105, a logged-in user can discover saved credentials, even though the UI hides them. Using functionality within the application and a malicious host, it is possible to force the application to expose saved SSH/SFTP credentials. This can be done by using the application's editor to change the expected SFTP Host IP to a malicious host, and then using the Check Connectivity option. The application then sends these saved credentials to the malicious host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20150", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTreasuryxpress\u00bbTreasuryxpress\u00bbVersion:19191105cpe:2.3:a:treasuryxpress:treasuryxpress:19191105:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-12-24  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-13  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sion-evans.com/blog/CVE-2019-20150.html", "ref_desc": "Sion Evans - A Penetration Tester's BlogExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
