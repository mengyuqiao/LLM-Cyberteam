{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15139", "Description": "In MyBB before version 1.8.24, the custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual editor doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. The weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. After upgrading MyBB to 1.8.24, make sure to update the version attribute in the `codebuttons` template for non-default themes to serve the latest version of the patched `jscripts/bbcodes_sceditor.js` file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15139", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMybb\u00bbMybbVersions  before (<) 1.8.24cpe:2.3:a:mybb:mybb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-14  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-04-26  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-37h7-vfv6-f8rj", "ref_desc": "MyCode message formatting XSS in visual editor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mybb/mybb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/37ad29dcd25489a37bdd89ebac761f22492558b0", "ref_desc": "Fix MyCode message formatting XSS in visual editor \u00b7 mybb/mybb@37ad29d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.24/", "ref_desc": "Version 1.8.24 - MyBBPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
