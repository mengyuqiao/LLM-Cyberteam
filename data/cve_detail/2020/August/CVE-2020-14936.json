{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14936", "Description": "Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the SNMP agent. Functions parsing the OIDs in SNMP requests lack sufficient allocated target-buffer capacity verification when writing parsed OID values. The function snmp_oid_decode_oid() may overwrite memory areas beyond the provided target buffer, when called from snmp_message_decode() upon an SNMP request reception. Because the content of the write operations is externally provided in the SNMP requests, it enables a remote overwrite of an IoT device's memory regions beyond the allocated buffer. This overflow may allow remote overwrite of stack and statically allocated variables memory regions by sending a crafted SNMP request.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14936", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  from including (>=) 4.4andup to, including, (<=) 4.5cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-04  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-25  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FypWH_g475jSL0mDFzquaATCeRIHQ2kj/view?usp=sharing", "ref_desc": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FypWH_g475jSL0mDFzquaATCeRIHQ2kj/view?usp=sharingThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/1351", "ref_desc": "Out of bounds memory read/write in SNMP agent \u00b7 Issue #1351 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
