{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3979", "Description": "InstallBuilder for Qt Windows (versions prior to 20.7.0) installers look for plugins at a predictable location at initialization time, writable by non-admin users. While those plugins are not required, they are loaded if present, which could allow an attacker to plant a malicious library which could result in code execution with the security scope of the installer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3979", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nInstallbuilder\u00bbInstallbuilder\u00bbForQTVersions  before (<) 20.7.0cpe:2.3:a:installbuilder:installbuilder:*:*:*:*:*:qt:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-06-04  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-04-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.07%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.installbuilder.com/2020/08/updates-and-bug-fixes-with-version-2070.html", "ref_desc": "InstallBuilder Blog: InstallBuilder 20.7.0 ReleasedVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
