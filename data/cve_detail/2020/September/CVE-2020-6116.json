{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6116", "Description": "An arbitrary code execution vulnerability exists in the rendering functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.\u2019s Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242. When drawing the contents of a page using colors from an indexed colorspace, the application can miscalculate the size of a buffer when allocating space for its colors. When using this allocated buffer, the application can write outside its bounds and cause memory corruption which can lead to code execution. A specially crafted document must be loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6116", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.13.2.242cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.13.2.242:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.16.2.300cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.16.2.300:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "9.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.61%  9.01%  +3.41 \n 2  2024-01-21  5.28%  5.61%  +0.33 \n 3  2023-06-03  9.28%  5.28%  -3.99 \n 4  2023-05-08  9.23%  9.28%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-04-24  12.02%  9.23%  -2.80 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.04%  12.02%  +10.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/131/Incorrect-Calculation-of-Buffer-Size.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-680 Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/680/Integer-Overflow-to-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1070", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2020-1070 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
