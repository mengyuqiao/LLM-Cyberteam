{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3418", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to send ICMPv6 traffic prior to the client being placed into RUN state. The vulnerability is due to an incomplete access control list (ACL) being applied prior to RUN state. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the associated service set identifier (SSID) and sending ICMPv6 traffic. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send ICMPv6 traffic prior to RUN state.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3418", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:17.1.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:17.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-40\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-80\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-cl\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l-c\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l-f\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewlc-icmpv6-qb9eYyCR", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000 Family Improper Access Control VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
