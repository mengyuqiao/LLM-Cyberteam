{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6112", "Description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the JPEG2000 Stripe Decoding functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.\u2019s Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242 when decoding sub-samples. While initializing tiles with sub-sample data, the application can miscalculate a pointer for the stripes in the tile which allow for the decoder to write out of-bounds and cause memory corruption. This can result in code execution. A specially crafted image can be embedded inside a PDF and loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6112", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.13.2.242cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.13.2.242:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.16.2.300cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.16.2.300:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-01-21  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-03  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-24  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.08%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-823 Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/823/Use-of-Out-of-range-Pointer-Offset.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1062", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2020-1062 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
