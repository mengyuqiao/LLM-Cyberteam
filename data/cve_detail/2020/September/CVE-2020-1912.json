{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1912", "Description": "An out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability when executing lazily compiled inner generator functions in Facebook Hermes prior to commit 091835377369c8fd5917d9b87acffa721ad2a168 allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1912", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermesVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.4.3cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.67% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.70%  0.67%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-10-19  0.59%  0.70%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-01-28  0.60%  0.59%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-01-13  0.59%  0.60%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-16  0.56%  0.59%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-26  0.52%  0.56%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-04-16  0.51%  0.52%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.51%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2020-1912", "ref_desc": "FacebookVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/091835377369c8fd5917d9b87acffa721ad2a168", "ref_desc": "Correctly restore whether or not a function is an inner generator \u00b7 facebook/hermes@0918353 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
