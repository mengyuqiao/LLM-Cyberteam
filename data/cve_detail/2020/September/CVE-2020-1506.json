{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1506", "Description": "<p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Wininit.dll handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute code with elevated permissions.</p>\n<p>There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring the Wininit.dll properly handles objects in memory.</p>", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1506", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbInternet Explorer\u00bbVersion:11cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:11:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1709When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1803When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1809When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1903When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1909When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:2004When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2019\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.28%  +0.23 \n 2  2024-01-01  0.64%  0.04%  -0.59 \n 3  2023-12-29  0.78%  0.64%  -0.14 \n 4  2023-08-18  0.83%  0.78%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-08-04  0.82%  0.83%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-06-23  0.80%  0.82%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-05-28  0.64%  0.80%  +0.16 \n 8  2023-05-15  0.51%  0.64%  +0.14 \n 9  2023-04-18  0.52%  0.51%  -0.01 \n 10  2023-03-23  0.38%  0.52%  +0.14 \n 11  2023-03-07  2.63%  0.38%  -2.25 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1506", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-1506 | Windows Start-Up Application Elevation of Privilege VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
