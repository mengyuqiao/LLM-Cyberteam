{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5777", "Description": "MAGMI versions prior to 0.7.24 are vulnerable to a remote authentication bypass due to allowing default credentials in the event there is a database connection failure. A remote attacker can trigger this connection failure if the Mysql setting max_connections (default 151) is lower than Apache (or another web server) setting MaxRequestWorkers (formerly MaxClients) (default 256). This can be done by sending at least 151 simultaneous requests to the Magento website to trigger a \"Too many connections\" error, then use default magmi:magmi basic authentication to remotely bypass authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5777", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMagmi Project\u00bbMagmiVersions  before (<) 0.7.24cpe:2.3:a:magmi_project:magmi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.38%  4.14%  -1.24 \n 2  2024-10-11  5.61%  5.38%  -0.23 \n 3  2024-05-19  4.04%  5.61%  +1.57 \n 4  2023-12-19  2.89%  4.04%  +1.15 \n 5  2023-10-19  2.38%  2.89%  +0.51 \n 6  2023-08-21  2.51%  2.38%  -0.13 \n 7  2023-06-01  1.79%  2.51%  +0.72 \n 8  2023-05-18  1.57%  1.79%  +0.21 \n 9  2023-05-05  1.57%  1.57%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-04-08  1.31%  1.57%  +0.26 \n 11  2023-03-07  86.89%  1.31%  -85.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2020-51", "ref_desc": "MAGMI Multiple Vulnerabilties - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XGQSuSErICfJWF7M0mNpYAGuz7s.html"}]}
