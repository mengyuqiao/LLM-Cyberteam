{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15843", "Description": "ActFax Version 7.10 Build 0335 (2020-05-25) is susceptible to a privilege escalation vulnerability due to insecure folder permissions on %PROGRAMFILES%\\ActiveFax\\Client\\, %PROGRAMFILES%\\ActiveFax\\Install\\ and %PROGRAMFILES%\\ActiveFax\\Terminal\\. The folder permissions allow \"Full Control\" to \"Everyone\". An authenticated local attacker can exploit this to replace the TSClientB.exe binary in the Terminal directory, which is executed on logon for every user. Alternatively, the attacker can replace any of the binaries in the Client or Install directories. The latter requires additional user interaction, for example starting the client.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15843", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nActfax\u00bbActfax\u00bbVersion:7.10UpdateBuild 0335cpe:2.3:a:actfax:actfax:7.10:build_0335:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.to.com/advisory-actfax-7-10-build-0335-privilege-escalation-cve-2020-15843/", "ref_desc": "Advisory: ActFax 7.10 Build 0335 Privilege Escalation (CVE-2020-15843) - TO BlogExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
