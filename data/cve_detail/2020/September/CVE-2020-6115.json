{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6115", "Description": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the cross-reference table repairing functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.\u2019s Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242. While searching for an object identifier in a malformed document that is missing from the cross-reference table, the application will save a reference to the object\u2019s cross-reference table entry inside a stack variable. If the referenced object identifier is not found, the application may resize the cross-reference table which can change the scope of its entry. Later when the application tries to reference cross-reference entry via the stack variable, the application will access memory belonging to the recently freed table causing a use-after-free condition. A specially crafted document can be delivered by an attacker and loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6115", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.13.2.242cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.13.2.242:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.16.2.300cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.16.2.300:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.19%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-01-21  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-03  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-04-24  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1068", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2020-1068 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
