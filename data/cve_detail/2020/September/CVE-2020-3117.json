{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3117", "Description": "A vulnerability in the API Framework of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject crafted HTTP headers in the web server's response. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a crafted URL and receive a malicious HTTP response. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into valid HTTP responses sent to a user's browser.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3117", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:11.8.0-382cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:11.8.0-382:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:12.0.1-268cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:12.0.1-268:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbContent Security Management ApplianceVersions  before (<) 13.0.0-187cpe:2.3:a:cisco:content_security_management_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-25  0.09%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-10-10  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-26  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.09%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/113/Improper-Neutralization-of-CRLF-Sequences-in-HTTP-Headers-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-wsa-sma-header-inject", "ref_desc": "Cisco Web Security Appliance and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance HTTP Header Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
