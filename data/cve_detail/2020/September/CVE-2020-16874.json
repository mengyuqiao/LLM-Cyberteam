{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-16874", "Description": "<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Visual Studio when it improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>\n<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to convince a user to open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Visual Studio handles objects in memory.</p>", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-16874", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbVisual Studio\u00bbVersion:2012UpdateUpdate 5cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:visual_studio:2012:update_5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbVisual Studio\u00bbVersion:2015UpdateUpdate 3cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:visual_studio:2015:update_3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbVisual Studio\u00bbVersion:2013UpdateUpdate 5cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:visual_studio:2013:update_5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbVisual Studio 2017Versions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.8cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:visual_studio_2017:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbVisual Studio 2019Versions  from including (>=) 16.5andup to, including, (<=) 16.6cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:visual_studio_2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbVisual Studio 2019Versions  from including (>=) 16.0andup to, including, (<=) 16.3cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:visual_studio_2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.34%  2.14%  +0.80 \n 2  2024-11-21  2.20%  1.34%  -0.86 \n 3  2024-11-06  1.15%  2.20%  +1.04 \n 4  2024-09-18  1.63%  1.15%  -0.48 \n 5  2024-09-04  1.29%  1.63%  +0.34 \n 6  2024-08-18  1.25%  1.29%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-08-02  2.15%  1.25%  -0.89 \n 8  2024-07-16  1.17%  2.15%  +0.98 \n 9  2024-07-01  1.31%  1.17%  -0.14 \n 10  2024-06-13  1.16%  1.31%  +0.15 \n 11  2024-04-25  1.53%  1.16%  -0.37 \n 12  2024-04-08  1.28%  1.53%  +0.24 \n 13  2024-03-21  1.97%  1.28%  -0.68 \n 14  2024-03-03  1.37%  1.97%  +0.60 \n 15  2024-02-15  1.67%  1.37%  -0.31 \n 16  2024-01-30  1.80%  1.67%  -0.13 \n 17  2024-01-15  2.75%  1.80%  -0.95 \n 18  2024-01-01  2.45%  2.75%  +0.30 \n 19  2023-12-29  4.19%  2.45%  -1.74 \n 20  2023-12-14  4.36%  4.19%  -0.17 \n 21  2023-11-29  12.35%  4.36%  -7.99 \n 22  2023-11-13  5.01%  12.35%  +7.34 \n 23  2023-10-29  16.01%  5.01%  -10.99 \n 24  2023-10-15  8.44%  16.01%  +7.56 \n 25  2023-09-29  11.75%  8.44%  -3.31 \n 26  2023-09-15  9.51%  11.75%  +2.25 \n 27  2023-08-31  12.35%  9.51%  -2.85 \n 28  2023-08-18  6.77%  12.35%  +5.58 \n 29  2023-08-04  21.51%  6.77%  -14.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-16874", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-16874 | Visual Studio Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
