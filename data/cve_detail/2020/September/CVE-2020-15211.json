{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15211", "Description": "In TensorFlow Lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative `-1` value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the `-1` index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue is patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83), and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the `-1` special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is erro-prone, we advise upgrading to the patched code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15211", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andbefore (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  before (<) 1.15.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.2cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.26%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-16  0.18%  0.24%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-11-27  0.20%  0.18%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-05-02  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.54%  0.17%  -1.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e11f55585f614645b360563072ffeb5c3eeff162", "ref_desc": "[tflite]: Insert `nullptr` checks when obtaining tensors. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@e11f555 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fff2c8326280c07733828f990548979bdc893859", "ref_desc": "[tflite]: Insert `nullptr` checks when obtaining tensors. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@fff2c83 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/46d5b0852528ddfd614ded79bccc75589f801bd9", "ref_desc": "[tflite] Test for `kTfLiteOptionalTensor` in `GetInput`. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@46d5b08 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cd31fd0ce0449a9e0f83dcad08d6ed7f1d6bef3f", "ref_desc": "[tflite]: Insert `nullptr` checks when obtaining tensors. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@cd31fd0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/00302787b788c5ff04cb6f62aed5a74d936e86c0", "ref_desc": "[tflite] Make `GetOptionalInputTensor` the same as `GetInput`. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@0030278 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cvpc-8phh-8f45", "ref_desc": "Out of bounds access in TFLite operators \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.3.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ortjngyi56v7lluowJssSjRFy_Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1970c2158b1ffa416d159d03c3370b9a462aee35", "ref_desc": "[tflite]: Insert `nullptr` checks when obtaining tensors. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@1970c21 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1766-1: moderate: Security update fMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wCL-WJMvXAseFrdJPj9KkoNFedE.html"}]}
