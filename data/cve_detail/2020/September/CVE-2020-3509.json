{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3509", "Description": "A vulnerability in the DHCP message handler of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the supervisor to crash, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) messages are parsed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious DHCPv4 message to or through a WAN interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device. Note: On Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers, all of the following are considered WAN interfaces: 10 Gbps Ethernet interfaces 100 Gbps Ethernet interfaces Port channel interfaces that include multiple 10 and/or 100 Gbps Ethernet interfaces", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3509", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.7(1)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.7\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCbr-8\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-10  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-05-01  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-388", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/388/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-dhcp-dos-JSCKX43h", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers DHCP Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
