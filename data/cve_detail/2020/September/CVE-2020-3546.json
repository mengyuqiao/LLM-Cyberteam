{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3546", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of requests that are sent to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the IP addresses that are configured on the internal interfaces of the affected device. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3546", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 13.5.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-07  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-20  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-04-10  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-info-disclosure-vMJMMgJ", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
