{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15487", "Description": "Re:Desk 2.3 contains a blind unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the getBaseCriteria() function in the protected/models/Ticket.php file. By modifying the folder GET parameter, it is possible to execute arbitrary SQL statements via a crafted URL. Unauthenticated remote command execution is possible by using this SQL injection to update certain database values, which are then executed by a bizRule eval() function in the yii/framework/web/auth/CAuthManager.php file. Resultant authorization bypass is also possible, by recovering or modifying password hashes and password reset tokens, allowing for administrative privileges to be obtained.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15487", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nRe-desk\u00bbRe:desk\u00bbVersion:2.3cpe:2.3:a:re-desk:re\\:desk:2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.24%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-02-03  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-16  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-05-07  0.11%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.11%  -1.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://labs.f-secure.com/advisories/redesk-v2-3-multiple-issues/", "ref_desc": "Re:Desk v2.3 - Multiple IssuesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1Ck5Zhrlt6Ido-A8opj2pWY9amc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.re-desk.com/download-help-desk-software.html", "ref_desc": "Download Help Desk Ticketing Software Open SourceVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4o5J3aPtj5sdV96NQZW7uK6HAWM.html"}]}
