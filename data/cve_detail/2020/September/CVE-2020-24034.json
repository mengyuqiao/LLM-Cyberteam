{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24034", "Description": "Sagemcom F@ST 5280 routers using firmware version 1.150.61 have insecure deserialization that allows any authenticated user to perform a privilege escalation to any other user. By making a request with valid sess_id, nonce, and ha1 values inside of the serialized session cookie, an attacker may alter the user value inside of this cookie, and assume the role and permissions of the user specified. By assuming the role of the user internal, which is inaccessible to end users by default, the attacker gains the permissions of the internal account, which includes the ability to flash custom firmware to the router, allowing the attacker to achieve a complete compromise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24034", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSagemcom\u00bbF@st 5280 Router Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.150.61cpe:2.3:o:sagemcom:f\\@st_5280_router_firmware:1.150.61:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Sagemcom\u00bbF@st 5280 Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "2.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.06%  2.11%  +1.05 \n 2  2024-01-05  1.05%  1.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-19  0.74%  1.05%  +0.31 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.75%  0.74%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-09-05  0.53%  0.75%  +0.22 \n 6  2023-08-21  0.41%  0.53%  +0.12 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.41%  -0.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.sagemcom.com/fr/haut-debit", "ref_desc": "Haut d\u00e9bit | Support Sagemcom | Site officielVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Sep/3", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Sagemcom router insecure deserialization > privilege escalationMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159026/Sagemcom-F-ST-5280-Privilege-Escalation.html", "ref_desc": "Sagemcom F@ST 5280 Privilege Escalation \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Sep/3", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Sagemcom router insecure deserialization > privilege escalationMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
