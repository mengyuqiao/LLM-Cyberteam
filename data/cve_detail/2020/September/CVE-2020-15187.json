{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15187", "Description": "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2, a Helm plugin can contain duplicates of the same entry, with the last one always used. If a plugin is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install hooks, causing a local execution attack. To perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the git repository or plugin archive (.tgz) while being downloaded (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This issue has been patched in Helm 2.16.11 and Helm 3.3.2. As a possible workaround make sure to install plugins using a secure connection protocol like SSL.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15187", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHelm\u00bbHelmVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.16.11cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHelm\u00bbHelmVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.3.2cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.07%  -1.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-694 Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/694/Use-of-Multiple-Resources-with-Duplicate-Identifier.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-c52f-pq47-2r9j", "ref_desc": "plugin.yaml file allows for duplicate entries \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/d9ef5ce8bad512e325390c0011be1244b8380e4b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-c52f-pq47-2r9j \u00b7 helm/helm@d9ef5ce \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
