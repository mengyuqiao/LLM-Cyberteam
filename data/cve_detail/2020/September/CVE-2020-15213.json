{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15213", "Description": "In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using segment sum can trigger a denial of service by causing an out of memory allocation in the implementation of segment sum. Since code uses the last element of the tensor holding them to determine the dimensionality of output tensor, attackers can use a very large value to trigger a large allocation. The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to limit the maximum value in the segment ids tensor. This only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model, but a similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime, between inference steps. However, if the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15213", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-05-02  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-hjmq-236j-8m87", "ref_desc": "Denial of service from TFLite implementation of segment sum \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a", "ref_desc": "[tflite] Validate segment ids for segment_sum. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@204945b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NgTn4LDZPwCZ1kNBvWZA7QmKuSA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.3.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ortjngyi56v7lluowJssSjRFy_Q.html"}]}
