{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15186", "Description": "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2 plugin names are not sanitized properly. As a result, a malicious plugin author could use characters in a plugin name that would result in unexpected behavior, such as duplicating the name of another plugin or spoofing the output to `helm --help`. This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2. A possible workaround is to not install untrusted Helm plugins. Examine the `name` field in the `plugin.yaml` file for a plugin, looking for characters outside of the [a-zA-Z0-9._-] range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15186", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nHelm\u00bbHelmVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.16.11cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHelm\u00bbHelmVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.3.2cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-m54r-vrmv-hw33", "ref_desc": "Sanitizing plugin names \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/809e2d999e2c33e20e77f6bff30652d79c287542", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-m54r-vrmv-hw33 \u00b7 helm/helm@809e2d9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
