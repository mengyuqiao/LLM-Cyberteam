{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15173", "Description": "In ACCEL-PPP (an implementation of PPTP/PPPoE/L2TP/SSTP), there is a buffer overflow when receiving an l2tp control packet ith an AVP which type is a string and no hidden flags, length set to less than 6. If your application is used in open networks or there are untrusted nodes in the network it is highly recommended to apply the patch. The problem was patched with commit 2324bcd5ba12cf28f47357a8f03cd41b7c04c52b As a workaround changes of commit 2324bcd5ba12cf28f47357a8f03cd41b7c04c52b can be applied to older versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15173", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nAccel-ppp\u00bbAccel-pppVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.12.0-92-g38b6104cpe:2.3:a:accel-ppp:accel-ppp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.33%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-05-26  0.33%  0.36%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.33%  -0.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/accel-ppp/accel-ppp/security/advisories/GHSA-rr68-fchr-69vf", "ref_desc": "A possible heap buffer overflow when receiving an l2tp control packet with an AVP which type is a string and no hidden flags, length set to less than 6 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 accel-ppp/accel-ppp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/accel-ppp/accel-ppp/commit/2324bcd5ba12cf28f47357a8f03cd41b7c04c52b", "ref_desc": "l2tp: fix RCE through buffer overflow & fix LE/BE compatibility \u00b7 accel-ppp/accel-ppp@2324bcd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
