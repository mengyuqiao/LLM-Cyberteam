{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3545", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco FXOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrative credentials to cause a buffer overflow condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of values that are parsed from a specific file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted file that, when it is processed, may cause a stack-based buffer overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system with root privileges. An attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials to exploit this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3545", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Extensible Operating SystemVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.3.1.58cpe:2.3:o:cisco:firepower_extensible_operating_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 4110\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 4112\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 4115\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 4120\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 4125\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 4140\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 4145\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 4150\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 9300\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fxos-buffer-cSdmfWUt", "ref_desc": "Cisco FXOS Software Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
