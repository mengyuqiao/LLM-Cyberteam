{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3390", "Description": "A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap generation for wireless clients of the Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly reload, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation of the information used to generate an SNMP trap in relation to a wireless client connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an 802.1x packet with crafted parameters during the wireless authentication setup phase of a connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, causing a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3390", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.12.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-40\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-80\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-cl\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l-c\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l-f\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-ewlc-snmp-dos-wNkedg9K", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000 Family SNMP Trap Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
