{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1911", "Description": "A type confusion vulnerability when resolving properties of JavaScript objects with specially-crafted prototype chains in Facebook Hermes prior to commit fe52854cdf6725c2eaa9e125995da76e6ceb27da allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1911", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermesVersions  before (<) 0.4.3cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-14  0.32%  0.37%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-01-22  0.32%  0.32%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-01-07  0.32%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-10  0.30%  0.32%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-20  0.28%  0.30%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-04-10  0.30%  0.28%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.30%  -1.15 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/843/Access-of-Resource-Using-Incompatible-Type-Type-Confusion-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2020-1911", "ref_desc": "FacebookThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/fe52854cdf6725c2eaa9e125995da76e6ceb27da", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2020-1911] Look up HostObject computed properties on the right o\u2026 \u00b7 facebook/hermes@fe52854 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
