{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24045", "Description": "A sandbox escape issue was discovered in TitanHQ SpamTitan Gateway 7.07. It limits the admin user to a restricted shell, allowing execution of a small number of tools of the operating system. The restricted shell can be bypassed by presenting a fake vmware-tools ISO image to the guest virtual machine running SpamTitan Gateway. This ISO image should contain a valid Perl script at the vmware-freebsd-tools/vmware-tools-distrib/vmware-install.pl path. The fake ISO image will be mounted and the script wmware-install.pl will be executed with super-user privileges as soon as the hidden option to install VMware Tools is selected in the main menu of the restricted shell (option number 5). The contents of the script can be whatever the attacker wants, including a backdoor or similar.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24045", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTitanhq\u00bbSpamtitan\u00bbVersion:7.07cpe:2.3:a:titanhq:spamtitan:7.07:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.02%  2.58%  +1.57 \n 2  2024-01-21  1.01%  1.02%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-21  0.71%  1.01%  +0.30 \n 4  2023-09-21  0.50%  0.71%  +0.21 \n 5  2023-03-16  0.50%  0.50%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.50%  -1.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/felmoltor", "ref_desc": "felmoltor (Felipe Molina) \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-HgPbIA8vzjlW7hIeO4Dbp-SSYY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/felmoltor", "ref_desc": "Felipe Molina (@felmoltor) / TwitterThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cQxJcAg4R6DK7cBxs0w6kTSgt2k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sensepost.com/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/", "ref_desc": "SensePost | Clash of the (spam)titanExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fanc7JZkE6q_rvkyaPpLUrpaXT8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.titanhq.com/", "ref_desc": "DNS Filter, DNS filtering, Spam Filter, Email Filter, Email Archive - ArcTitan, SpamTitan, WebTitanVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
