{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3137", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface of the affected device does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3137", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security ApplianceVersions  up to, including, (<=) 13.0.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-26  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-06-08  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-04-29  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-email-sec-xss-EbjXuXwP", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
