{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13948", "Description": "While investigating a bug report on Apache Superset, it was determined that an authenticated user could craft requests via a number of templated text fields in the product that would allow arbitrary access to Python\u2019s `os` package in the web application process in versions < 0.37.1. It was thus possible for an authenticated user to list and access files, environment variables, and process information. Additionally it was possible to set environment variables for the current process, create and update files in folders writable by the web process, and execute arbitrary programs accessible by the web process. All other operations available to the `os` package in Python were also available, even if not explicitly enumerated in this CVE.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13948", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSupersetVersions  before (<) 0.37.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:superset:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-10  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0e35c7c5672a6146b962840be5c1a7b7461c05a71cd7ecc62774d155@%3Cnotifications.superset.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[GitHub] [incubator-superset] ktmud commented on pull request #11617: feat: support 'chevron' library for templating as jinja alternative - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdeee068ac1e0c43bd5b69830240f30598df15a2ef9f7998c7b29131e%40%3Cdev.superset.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2020-13948] Apache Superset Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r4fc7115f6e63ac255c48fc68c0da592df55fe4be47cae6378d39ac22@%3Cnotifications.superset.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[GitHub] [incubator-superset] robdiciuccio commented on pull request #11617: feat: support 'chevron' library for templating as jinja alternative - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
