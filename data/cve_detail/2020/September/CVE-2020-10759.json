{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10759", "Description": "A PGP signature bypass flaw was found in fwupd (all versions), which could lead to the installation of unsigned firmware. As per upstream, a signature bypass is theoretically possible, but not practical because the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) is either not implemented or enabled in versions of fwupd shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10759", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.40%  0.05%  -1.36 \n 3  2023-02-13  1.67%  1.40%  -0.27 \n 4  2023-02-03  1.40%  1.67%  +0.27 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1844316", "ref_desc": "1844316 \u2013 (CVE-2020-10759) CVE-2020-10759 fwupd: Possible bypass in signature verificationIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_CVE-2020-10759_signature_verification_bypass.md", "ref_desc": "advisories/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_CVE-2020-10759_signature_verification_bypass.md at master \u00b7 justinsteven/advisories \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
