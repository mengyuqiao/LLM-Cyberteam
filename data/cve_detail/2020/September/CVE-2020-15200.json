{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15200", "Description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning of the `values` tensor. Thus, the code sets up conditions to cause a heap buffer overflow. A `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector where each element is a hashmap. However, if the first element of `splits_values` is not 0, `batch_idx` will never be 1, hence there will be no hashmap at index 0 in `per_batch_counts`. Trying to access that in the user code results in a segmentation fault. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15200", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.3.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.35%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-03-17  0.21%  0.30%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-05-02  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.18%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02", "ref_desc": "Fix multiple vulnerabilities in `tf.raw_ops.*CountSparseOutput`. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@3cbb917 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0oxvPI741xqvyeL7wnJpCZQ9umM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-x7rp-74x2-mjf3", "ref_desc": "Segfault due to invalid splits in RaggedCountSparseOutput \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.3.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ortjngyi56v7lluowJssSjRFy_Q.html"}]}
