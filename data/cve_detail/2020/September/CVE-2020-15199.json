{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15199", "Description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `splits` tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses this quantity to initialize a different data structure. Since `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector, it needs to have at least one element to not be `nullptr`. If user passes a `splits` tensor that is empty or has exactly one element, we get a `SIGABRT` signal raised by the operating system. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15199", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.3.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.26%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-03-17  0.15%  0.22%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-05-02  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02", "ref_desc": "Fix multiple vulnerabilities in `tf.raw_ops.*CountSparseOutput`. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@3cbb917 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0oxvPI741xqvyeL7wnJpCZQ9umM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-x5cp-9pcf-pp3h", "ref_desc": "Abort due to invalid splits in RaggedCountSparseOutput \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.3.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ortjngyi56v7lluowJssSjRFy_Q.html"}]}
