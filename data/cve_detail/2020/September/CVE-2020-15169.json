{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15169", "Description": "In Action View before versions 5.2.4.4 and 6.0.3.3 there is a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Action View's translation helpers. Views that allow the user to control the default (not found) value of the `t` and `translate` helpers could be susceptible to XSS attacks. When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default for a missing translation key named html or ending in _html, the default string is incorrectly marked as HTML-safe and not escaped. This is patched in versions 6.0.3.3 and 5.2.4.4. A workaround without upgrading is proposed in the source advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15169", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAction View Project\u00bbAction View\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 5.2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:action_view_project:action_view:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nAction View Project\u00bbAction View\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0.0andbefore (<) 6.0.3.3cpe:2.3:a:action_view_project:action_view:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.19%  0.21%  -1.99 \n 2  2024-07-16  2.26%  2.19%  -0.07 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.87%  2.26%  +1.39 \n 4  2023-07-21  0.61%  0.87%  +0.25 \n 5  2023-05-28  0.57%  0.61%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-04-18  0.56%  0.57%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.56%  -0.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-cfjv-5498-mph5", "ref_desc": "Potential XSS vulnerability in Action View \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rails/rails \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4766", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4766-1 railsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EvzEug-Il2KcCGLCeK1T4wJm8o0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XJ7NUWXAEVRQCROIIBV4C6WXO6IR3KSB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: rubygem-actiontext-6.0.3.3-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/leivli5d_Dl5hVeJnQraV1tR8Tc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/10/msg00015.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2403-1] rails security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
