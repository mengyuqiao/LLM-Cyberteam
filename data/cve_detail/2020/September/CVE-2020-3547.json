{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3547", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA), and Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because an insecure method is used to mask certain passwords on the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by looking at the raw HTML code that is received from the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain some of the passwords configured throughout the interface.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3547", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 13.6.1-193cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbContent Security Management Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 13.5.1-277cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.7.2-011cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-20  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-wsa-esa-info-dis-vsvPzOHP", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance, Cisco Content Security Management Appliance, and Cisco Web Security Appliance Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
