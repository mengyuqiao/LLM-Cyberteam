{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6113", "Description": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the object stream parsing functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.\u2019s Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242 when updating its cross-reference table. When processing an object stream from a PDF document, the application will perform a calculation in order to allocate memory for the list of indirect objects. Due to an error when calculating this size, an integer overflow may occur which can result in an undersized buffer being allocated. Later when initializing this buffer, the application can write outside its bounds which can cause a memory corruption that can lead to code execution. A specially crafted document can be delivered to a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6113", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.13.2.242cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.13.2.242:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.16.2.300cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.16.2.300:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "9.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  6.73%  9.62%  +2.89 \n 2  2023-06-03  11.66%  6.73%  -4.93 \n 3  2023-05-08  11.60%  11.66%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-04-24  14.97%  11.60%  -3.37 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.04%  14.97%  +13.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/131/Incorrect-Calculation-of-Buffer-Size.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1063", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2020-1063 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
