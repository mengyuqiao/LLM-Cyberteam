{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3492", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Flexible NetFlow Version 9 packet processor of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers and Cisco AireOS Software for Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of certain parameters in a Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by spoofing the address of an existing Access Point on the network and sending a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) packet that includes a crafted Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process crash that would lead to a reload of the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3492", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.12.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-40\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-80\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-cl\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l-c\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l-f\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-10  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-05-01  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-wlc-fnfv9-EvrAQpNX", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software for Catalyst 9800 Series and Cisco AireOS Software for Cisco WLC Flexible NetFlow Version 9 Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
