{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11986", "Description": "To be able to analyze gradle projects, the build scripts need to be executed. Apache NetBeans follows this pattern. This causes the code of the build script to be invoked at load time of the project. Apache NetBeans up to and including 12.0 did not request consent from the user for the analysis of the project at load time. This in turn will run potentially malicious code, from an external source, without the consent of the user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11986", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbNetbeansVersions  up to, including, (<=) 12.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:netbeans:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-14  0.26%  0.35%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-08-02  0.36%  0.26%  -0.11 \n 3  2023-05-26  0.45%  0.36%  -0.09 \n 4  2023-04-16  0.62%  0.45%  -0.17 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.62%  -0.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbb8ea1b684e73107a0a6a30245ad6112bec2e6e171368c808e69217e%40%3Cannounce.netbeans.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2020-11986] Opening a Gradle project with Apache NetBeans executes foreign script immediately - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra81cdcf325bf4ea085c178f95ed6b50d4f1c095be50577b2f9b88984@%3Cnotifications.netbeans.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[GitHub] [netbeans] jtulach edited a comment on pull request #2822: Offer to trust and prime the project when it is being opened. - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0fb2ba21a0469f64c2dff945dbe68f7b1122e1bff2b2b46271682406@%3Cnotifications.netbeans.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Pony Mail!Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
