{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15170", "Description": "apollo-adminservice before version 1.7.1 does not implement access controls. If users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it doesn't have access control built-in. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis directly to access/edit the application's configurations. To fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15170", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCtrip\u00bbApolloVersions  before (<) 1.7.1cpe:2.3:a:ctrip:apollo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-01-29  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-05-27  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/pull/3233/commits/ae9ba6cfd32ed80469f162e5e3583e2477862ddf", "ref_desc": "add access control support for admin service by nobodyiam \u00b7 Pull Request #3233 \u00b7 ctripcorp/apollo \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/security/advisories/GHSA-xpmx-h7xq-xffh", "ref_desc": "Potential access control security issue in apollo-adminservice \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ctripcorp/apollo \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
