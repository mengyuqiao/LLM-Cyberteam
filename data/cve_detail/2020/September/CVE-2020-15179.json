{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15179", "Description": "The ScratchSig extension for MediaWiki before version 1.0.1 allows stored Cross-Site Scripting. Using <script> tag inside <scratchsig> tag, attackers with edit permission can execute scripts on visitors' browser. With MediaWiki JavaScript API, this can potentially lead to privilege escalation and/or account takeover. This has been patched in release 1.0.1. This has already been deployed to all Scratch Wikis. No workarounds exist other than disabling the extension completely.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15179", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nScratch-wiki\u00bbScratchsig\u00bbForMediawikiVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:scratch-wiki:scratchsig:*:*:*:*:*:mediawiki:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/InternationalScratchWiki/wiki-scratchsig/security/advisories/GHSA-gp9v-pg9f-vmp6", "ref_desc": "Stored Cross-site Scripting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 InternationalScratchWiki/wiki-scratchsig \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/InternationalScratchWiki/wiki-scratchsig/commit/4160a39a20eebeb63a59eb7597a91b961eca6388", "ref_desc": "<scratchsig><script>location='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9W\u2026 \u00b7 InternationalScratchWiki/wiki-scratchsig@4160a39 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
