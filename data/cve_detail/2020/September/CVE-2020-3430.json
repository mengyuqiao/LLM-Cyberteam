The vulnerability is due to improper handling of input to the application protocol handlers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a link within a message sent by email or other messaging platform. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system with the privileges of the user account that is running the Cisco Jabber client software.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3430", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.1andbefore (<) 12.1.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.9andbefore (<) 12.9.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.5andbefore (<) 12.5.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.6andbefore (<) 12.6.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.7andbefore (<) 12.7.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.8andbefore (<) 12.8.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.76% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-30  0.97%  0.76%  -0.22 \n 2  2024-10-30  1.07%  0.97%  -0.10 \n 3  2024-10-14  0.76%  1.07%  +0.31 \n 4  2024-09-28  0.64%  0.76%  +0.11 \n 5  2024-07-24  0.67%  0.64%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-05-20  0.67%  0.67%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.67%  -0.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-jabber-vY8M4KGB", "ref_desc": "Cisco Jabber for Windows Protocol Handler Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
