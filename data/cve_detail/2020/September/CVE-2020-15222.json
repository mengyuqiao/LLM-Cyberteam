{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15222", "Description": "In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go) before version 0.31.0, when using \"private_key_jwt\" authentication the uniqueness of the `jti` value is not checked. When using client authentication method \"private_key_jwt\", OpenId specification says the following about assertion `jti`: \"A unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties\". Hydra does not seem to check the uniqueness of this `jti` value. This problem is fixed in version 0.31.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15222", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nORY\u00bbFositeVersions  before (<) 0.31.0cpe:2.3:a:ory:fosite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.41%  +0.18 \n 2  2024-01-28  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-06-10  0.18%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-01  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.17%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ory/fosite/security/advisories/GHSA-v3q9-2p3m-7g43", "ref_desc": "Disallow replay of `private_key_jwt` by blacklisting JTIs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ory/fosite \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/0c9e0f6d654913ad57c507dd9a36631e1858a3e9", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-v3q9-2p3m-7g43 \u00b7 ory/fosite@0c9e0f6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication", "ref_desc": "Final: OpenID Connect Core 1.0 incorporating errata set 1Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
