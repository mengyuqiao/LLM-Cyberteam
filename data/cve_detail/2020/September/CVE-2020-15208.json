{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15208", "Description": "In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, when determining the common dimension size of two tensors, TFLite uses a `DCHECK` which is no-op outside of debug compilation modes. Since the function always returns the dimension of the first tensor, malicious attackers can craft cases where this is larger than that of the second tensor. In turn, this would result in reads/writes outside of bounds since the interpreter will wrongly assume that there is enough data in both tensors. The issue is patched in commit 8ee24e7949a203d234489f9da2c5bf45a7d5157d, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15208", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andbefore (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  before (<) 1.15.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.2cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-06-11  0.17%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-05-02  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.14%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-mxjj-953w-2c2v", "ref_desc": "Data corruption due to dimension mismatch in TFLite \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.3.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ortjngyi56v7lluowJssSjRFy_Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1766-1: moderate: Security update fMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wCL-WJMvXAseFrdJPj9KkoNFedE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8ee24e7949a203d234489f9da2c5bf45a7d5157d", "ref_desc": "[tflite] Ensure `MatchingDim` does not allow buffer overflow. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@8ee24e7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
