{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3429", "Description": "A vulnerability in the WPA2 and WPA3 security implementation of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect packet processing during the WPA2 and WPA3 authentication handshake when configured for dot1x or pre-shared key (PSK) authentication key management (AKM) with 802.11r BSS Fast Transition (FT) enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3429", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.12.1scpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.1s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9300\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9400\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9500\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-40\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-80\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-cl\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wpa-dos-cXshjerc", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000 Family WPA Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
