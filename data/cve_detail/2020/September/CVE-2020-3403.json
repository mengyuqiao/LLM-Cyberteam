{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3403", "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject a command to the underlying operating system that will execute with root privileges upon the next reboot of the device. The authenticated user must have privileged EXEC permissions on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of values passed to a script that executes during device startup. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by writing values to a specific file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges each time the affected device is restarted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3403", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:17.2.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:17.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-40\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-80\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-cl\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l-c\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst 9800-l-f\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-cmdinj-2MzhjM6K", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
