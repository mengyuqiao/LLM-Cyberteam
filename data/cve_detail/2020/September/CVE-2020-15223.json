{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15223", "Description": "In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go) before version 0.34.0, the `TokenRevocationHandler` ignores errors coming from the storage. This can lead to unexpected 200 status codes indicating successful revocation while the token is still valid. Whether an attacker can use this for her advantage depends on the ability to trigger errors in the store. This is fixed in version 0.34.0", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15223", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nORY\u00bbFositeVersions  before (<) 0.34.0cpe:2.3:a:ory:fosite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-29  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-14  0.14%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-06-10  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-01  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-05  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ory/fosite/security/advisories/GHSA-7mqr-2v3q-v2wm", "ref_desc": "Ignored storage errors on token revokation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ory/fosite \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009#section-2.2.1", "ref_desc": "RFC 7009 - OAuth 2.0 Token RevocationThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/03dd55813f5521985f7dd64277b7ba0cf1441319", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7mqr-2v3q-v2wm \u00b7 ory/fosite@03dd558 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
