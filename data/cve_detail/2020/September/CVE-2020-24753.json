{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24753", "Description": "A memory corruption vulnerability in Objective Open CBOR Run-time (oocborrt) in versions before 2020-08-12 could allow an attacker to execute code via crafted Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) input to the cbor2json decoder. An uncaught error while decoding CBOR Major Type 3 text strings leads to the use of an attacker-controllable uninitialized stack value. This can be used to modify memory, causing a crash or potentially exploitable heap corruption.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24753", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nObjective Open Cbor Run-time Project\u00bbObjective Open Cbor Run-timeVersions  before (<) 2020-08-12cpe:2.3:a:objective_open_cbor_run-time_project:objective_open_cbor_run-time:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.60%  1.13%  +0.53 \n 2  2024-10-27  0.51%  0.60%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-02-05  0.52%  0.51%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-01-21  0.42%  0.52%  +0.10 \n 5  2023-08-24  0.40%  0.42%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-10  0.29%  0.40%  +0.11 \n 7  2023-06-03  0.27%  0.29%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-04-24  0.23%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.23%  -1.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/908/Use-of-Uninitialized-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/objsys/oocborrt/commit/539851c66778f68a244633985f6f8d0df94ea3b3", "ref_desc": "fixed missing return status test error \u00b7 objsys/oocborrt@539851c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://warcollar.com/cve-2020-24753.html", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-24753Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
