{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1575", "Description": "<p>A cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.</p>\n<p>The attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. The attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.</p>", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1575", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbSharepoint Foundation\u00bbVersion:2013UpdateSP1cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_foundation:2013:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-29  0.16%  0.07%  -0.10 \n 3  2023-10-29  0.19%  0.16%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-09-29  0.23%  0.19%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-06-23  0.28%  0.23%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-04-06  0.10%  0.28%  +0.17 \n 7  2023-03-10  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.15%  0.12%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1575", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-1575 | Microsoft Office SharePoint XSS VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
