{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15163", "Description": "Python TUF (The Update Framework) reference implementation before version 0.12 it will incorrectly trust a previously downloaded root metadata file which failed verification at download time. This allows an attacker who is able to serve multiple new versions of root metadata (i.e. by a person-in-the-middle attack) culminating in a version which has not been correctly signed to control the trust chain for future updates. This is fixed in version 0.12 and newer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15163", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbThe Update FrameworkVersions  before (<) 0.12.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:the_update_framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/releases/tag/v0.12.0", "ref_desc": "Release tuf v0.12.0 \u00b7 theupdateframework/tuf \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/commit/3d342e648fbacdf43a13d7ba8886aaaf07334af7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #885 from trishankatdatadog:trishankatdatadog/corr\u2026 \u00b7 theupdateframework/tuf@3d342e6 \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/tuf", "ref_desc": "tuf \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-f8mr-jv2c-v8mg", "ref_desc": "Invalid root may become trusted root \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 theupdateframework/tuf \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/pull/885", "ref_desc": "Do not immediately verify latest root when rotating by trishankatdatadog \u00b7 Pull Request #885 \u00b7 theupdateframework/tuf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
