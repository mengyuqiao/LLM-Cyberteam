{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3414", "Description": "A vulnerability in the packet processing of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco 4461 Integrated Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of IPv4 or IPv6 traffic to or through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending IP traffic to or through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3414", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:17.1.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:17.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4461 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.9.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.9.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4461 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.11.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4461 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.12.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4461 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.10.4cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.10.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4461 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-10  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-05-01  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-19", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/19/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ISR4461-gKKUROhx", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco 4461 Integrated Services Routers Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
