{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10767", "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the implementation of the Enhanced IBPB (Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier). The IBPB mitigation will be disabled when STIBP is not available or when the Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is available. This flaw allows a local attacker to perform a Spectre V2 style attack when this configuration is active. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10767", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 5.8.0cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-440 Expected Behavior Violation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/440/Expected-Behavior-Violation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-10767", "ref_desc": "1845867 \u2013 (CVE-2020-10767) CVE-2020-10767 kernel: Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier is force-disabled when STIBP is unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available.Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=21998a351512eba4ed5969006f0c55882d995ada", "ref_desc": "kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - Linux kernel source treePatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
