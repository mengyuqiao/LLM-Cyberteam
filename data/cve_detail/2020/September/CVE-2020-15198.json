{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15198", "Description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `indices` tensor has the same shape as the `values` one. The values in these tensors are always accessed in parallel. Thus, a shape mismatch can result in accesses outside the bounds of heap allocated buffers. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15198", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-05-02  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02", "ref_desc": "Fix multiple vulnerabilities in `tf.raw_ops.*CountSparseOutput`. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@3cbb917 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0oxvPI741xqvyeL7wnJpCZQ9umM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.3.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ortjngyi56v7lluowJssSjRFy_Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-jc87-6vpp-7ff3", "ref_desc": "Heap buffer overflow due to invalid indices in SparseCountSparseOutput \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
