{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25213", "Description": "The File Manager (wp-file-manager) plugin before 6.9 for WordPress allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code because it renames an unsafe example elFinder connector file to have the .php extension. This, for example, allows attackers to run the elFinder upload (or mkfile and put) command to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This was exploited in the wild in August and September 2020.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25213", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWebdesi9\u00bbFile Manager\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 6.9cpe:2.3:a:webdesi9:file_manager:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.47%  97.45%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-12-05  97.46%  97.47%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-11-04  97.46%  97.46%  0.00 \n 4  2024-07-27  97.38%  97.46%  +0.09 \n 5  2024-07-14  97.39%  97.38%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-05-27  97.40%  97.39%  0.00 \n 7  2024-03-01  97.38%  97.40%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-02-13  97.37%  97.38%  +0.02 \n 9  2024-02-07  97.38%  97.37%  -0.02 \n 10  2023-12-27  97.34%  97.38%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-11-27  97.38%  97.34%  -0.04 \n 12  2023-11-11  97.35%  97.38%  +0.03 \n 13  2023-10-13  97.36%  97.35%  -0.01 \n 14  2023-09-22  97.34%  97.36%  +0.02 \n 15  2023-08-29  97.39%  97.34%  -0.04 \n 16  2023-08-16  97.37%  97.39%  +0.01 \n 17  2023-07-19  97.39%  97.37%  -0.02 \n 18  2023-07-08  97.48%  97.39%  -0.09 \n 19  2023-07-06  97.49%  97.48%  -0.01 \n 20  2023-05-26  97.50%  97.49%  -0.01 \n 21  2023-05-13  97.48%  97.50%  +0.02 \n 22  2023-05-08  97.42%  97.48%  +0.06 \n 23  2023-04-16  97.39%  97.42%  +0.03 \n 24  2023-04-04  97.39%  97.39%  +0.00 \n 25  2023-03-08  97.40%  97.39%  -0.01 \n 26  2023-03-07  95.72%  97.40%  +1.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hotforsecurity.bitdefender.com/blog/wordpress-websites-attacked-via-file-manager-plugin-vulnerability-24048.html", "ref_desc": "WordPress Websites Attacked via File Manager Plugin Vulnerability \u2013 HOTforSecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171650/WordPress-File-Manager-6.9-Shell-Upload.html", "ref_desc": "WordPress File Manager 6.9 Shell Upload \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160003/WordPress-File-Manager-6.8-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "WordPress File Manager 6.8 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2373068", "ref_desc": "Changeset 2373068 \u2013 WordPress Plugin RepositoryPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/#developers", "ref_desc": "File Manager \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.orgProduct;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nH4dBjQ0l90s4yVu2FLoboMdQ_w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://seravo.com/blog/0-day-vulnerability-in-wp-file-manager/", "ref_desc": "Severe 0-day security vulnerability found by Seravo in WP File Manager | SeravoExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://zdnet.com/article/millions-of-wordpress-sites-are-being-probed-attacked-with-recent-plugin-bug/", "ref_desc": "Millions of WordPress sites are being probed and attacked with recent plugin bug | ZDNetPress/Media Coverage", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/w4fz5uck5/wp-file-manager-0day", "ref_desc": "GitHub - w4fz5uck5/wp-file-manager-0day: wp-file-manager 6.7 (Aug 2020) Wordpress Plugin 0day - Remote Code ExecutionExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordfence.com/blog/2020/09/700000-wordpress-users-affected-by-zero-day-vulnerability-in-file-manager-plugin/", "ref_desc": "700,000 WordPress Users Affected by Zero-Day Vulnerability in File Manager PluginExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
