{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15197", "Description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `indices` tensor has rank 2. This tensor must be a matrix because code assumes its elements are accessed as elements of a matrix. However, malicious users can pass in tensors of different rank, resulting in a `CHECK` assertion failure and a crash. This can be used to cause denial of service in serving installations, if users are allowed to control the components of the input sparse tensor. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15197", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.3.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.14%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-03-17  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02", "ref_desc": "Fix multiple vulnerabilities in `tf.raw_ops.*CountSparseOutput`. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@3cbb917 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0oxvPI741xqvyeL7wnJpCZQ9umM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-qc53-44cj-vfvx", "ref_desc": "Crash due to invalid splits in SparseCountSparseOutput \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.3.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ortjngyi56v7lluowJssSjRFy_Q.html"}]}
