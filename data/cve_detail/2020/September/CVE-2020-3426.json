{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3426", "Description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Low Power, Wide Area (LPWA) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive data or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input and validation checking mechanisms for virtual-LPWA (VLPWA) protocol modem messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive data or cause the VLPWA interface of the affected device to shut down, resulting in DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3426", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIOS\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1120 Connected Grid Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1240 Connected Grid Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb807 Industrial Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb809 Industrial Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb829 Industrial Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-11  0.41%  0.39%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-06-10  0.37%  0.41%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-05-01  0.36%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.36%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-lpwa-access-cXsD7PRA", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Virtual-LPWA Unauthorized Access VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
