{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-2044", "Description": "An information exposure through log file vulnerability where an administrator's password or other sensitive information may be logged in cleartext while using the CLI in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software. The opcmdhistory.log file was introduced to track operational command (op-command) usage but did not mask all sensitive information. The opcmdhistory.log file is removed in PAN-OS 9.1 and later PAN-OS versions. Command usage is recorded, instead, in the req_stats.log file in PAN-OS 9.1 and later PAN-OS versions. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.16; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.10; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2044", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.0.20cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.0andbefore (<) 9.1.3cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 8.1.0andbefore (<) 8.1.16cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.0.10cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2044", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-2044 PAN-OS: Passwords may be logged in clear text while storing operational command (op command) historyVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
