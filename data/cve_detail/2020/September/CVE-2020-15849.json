{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15849", "Description": "Re:Desk 2.3 has a blind authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the SettingsController class, in the actionEmailTemplates() method. A malicious actor with access to an administrative account could abuse this vulnerability to recover sensitive data from the application's database, allowing for authorization bypass and taking over additional accounts by means of modifying password-reset tokens stored in the database. Remote command execution is also possible by leveraging this to abuse the Yii framework's bizRule functionality, allowing for arbitrary PHP code to be executed by the application. Remote command execution is also possible by using this together with a separate insecure file upload vulnerability (CVE-2020-15488).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15849", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nRe-desk\u00bbRe:desk\u00bbVersion:2.3cpe:2.3:a:re-desk:re\\:desk:2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-02-03  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-03  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.43%  0.10%  -2.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://labs.f-secure.com/advisories/redesk-v2-3-multiple-issues/", "ref_desc": "Re:Desk v2.3 - Multiple IssuesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1Ck5Zhrlt6Ido-A8opj2pWY9amc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.re-desk.com/download-help-desk-software.html", "ref_desc": "Download Help Desk Ticketing Software Open SourceProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4o5J3aPtj5sdV96NQZW7uK6HAWM.html"}]}
