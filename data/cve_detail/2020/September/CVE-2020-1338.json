{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1338", "Description": "<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word software when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. For example, the file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.</p>\n<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Word software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Word handles files in memory.</p>", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1338", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbOffice\u00bbVersion:2019ForMacoscpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2019:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbOffice\u00bbVersion:2019cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2019:*:*:*:*:-:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbOffice\u00bbVersion:2016ForMacoscpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2016:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbSharepoint Server\u00bbVersion:2019cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_server:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbOffice Online Server\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office_online_server:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bb365 Apps\u00bbVersion:N/A    EnterpriseEditioncpe:2.3:a:microsoft:365_apps:-:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.82% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.39%  4.82%  +1.43 \n 2  2024-11-21  5.45%  3.39%  -2.06 \n 3  2024-11-06  2.93%  5.45%  +2.53 \n 4  2024-09-18  4.09%  2.93%  -1.16 \n 5  2024-09-04  3.25%  4.09%  +0.84 \n 6  2024-08-18  3.17%  3.25%  +0.08 \n 7  2024-08-02  5.34%  3.17%  -2.16 \n 8  2024-07-16  2.95%  5.34%  +2.38 \n 9  2024-07-01  3.52%  2.95%  -0.57 \n 10  2024-06-13  3.13%  3.52%  +0.39 \n 11  2024-05-29  2.98%  3.13%  +0.16 \n 12  2024-05-11  3.99%  2.98%  -1.01 \n 13  2024-04-25  4.41%  3.99%  -0.43 \n 14  2024-04-08  3.24%  4.41%  +1.17 \n 15  2024-03-21  4.89%  3.24%  -1.65 \n 16  2024-03-03  3.56%  4.89%  +1.33 \n 17  2024-02-15  4.33%  3.56%  -0.77 \n 18  2024-01-30  5.42%  4.33%  -1.09 \n 19  2024-01-15  7.63%  5.42%  -2.21 \n 20  2024-01-01  8.38%  7.63%  -0.76 \n 21  2023-12-29  8.17%  8.38%  +0.21 \n 22  2023-11-29  7.98%  8.17%  +0.19 \n 23  2023-10-29  9.75%  7.98%  -1.77 \n 24  2023-10-15  8.42%  9.75%  +1.33 \n 25  2023-08-18  8.02%  8.42%  +0.40 \n 26  2023-08-04  14.67%  8.02%  -6.65 \n 27  2023-07-21  10.92%  14.67%  +3.75 \n 28  2023-06-23  17.56%  10.92%  -6.65 \n 29  2023-05-28  14.76%  17.56%  +2.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1338", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-1338 | Microsoft Word Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
