{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3542", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Training could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to join a password-protected meeting without providing the meeting password. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to API requests that are a part of meeting join flow. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an API request to the application, which would return a URL that includes a meeting join page that is prepopulated with the meeting username and password. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to join the password-protected meeting. The attacker would be visible in the attendee list of the meeting.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3542", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex TrainingVersions  before (<) 40.7.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_training:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-20  0.10%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.10%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-meetings-UtbwOR4Q", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Training Unauthorized Meeting Join VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
