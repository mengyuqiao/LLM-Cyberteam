{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13995", "Description": "U.S. Air Force Sensor Data Management System extract75 has a buffer overflow that leads to code execution. An overflow in a global variable (sBuffer) leads to a Write-What-Where outcome. Writing beyond sBuffer will clobber most global variables until reaching a pointer such as DES_info or image_info. By controlling that pointer, one achieves an arbitrary write when its fields are assigned. The data written is from a potentially untrusted NITF file in the form of an integer. The attacker can gain control of the instruction pointer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13995", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nAirforce\u00bbNitf Extract Utility\u00bbVersion:7.5cpe:2.3:a:airforce:nitf_extract_utility:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.91%  1.19%  +0.28 \n 2  2024-11-04  0.77%  0.91%  +0.14 \n 3  2024-09-01  0.61%  0.77%  +0.16 \n 4  2024-01-29  0.40%  0.61%  +0.21 \n 5  2023-09-01  0.38%  0.40%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-18  0.39%  0.38%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-07-07  0.35%  0.39%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-06-11  0.33%  0.35%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-05-08  0.28%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-05-02  0.24%  0.28%  +0.04 \n 11  2023-03-10  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.23%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.riverloopsecurity.com/blog/2020/09/nitf-extract75-cve-2020-13995/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-13995: Details on a Vulnerability in a NITF Parser - River Loop SecurityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
