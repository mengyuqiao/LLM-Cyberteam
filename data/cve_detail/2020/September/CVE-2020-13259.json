{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13259", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of RAD SecFlow-1v os-image SF_0290_2.3.01.26 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. This could be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2020-13260.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13259", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nRAD\u00bbSecflow-1v Firmware\u00bbVersion:Os-image Sf 0290 2.3.01.26cpe:2.3:o:rad:secflow-1v_firmware:os-image_sf_0290_2.3.01.26:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:RAD\u00bbSecflow-1v\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.63%  +0.32 \n 2  2024-07-06  0.22%  0.31%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-06-03  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-08  0.20%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-02  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-23  0.23%  0.20%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  23.85%  0.23%  -23.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48809", "ref_desc": "RAD SecFlow-1v SF_0290_2.3.01.26 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (Reboot) - Hardware webapps ExploitExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2020090064", "ref_desc": "RAD SecFlow-1v web-based management interface - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CXSecurity.comExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
