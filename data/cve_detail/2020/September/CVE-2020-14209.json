{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14209", "Description": "Dolibarr before 11.0.5 allows low-privilege users to upload files of dangerous types, leading to arbitrary code execution. This occurs because .pht and .phar files can be uploaded. Also, a .htaccess file can be uploaded to reconfigure access control (e.g., to let .noexe files be executed as PHP code to defeat the .noexe protection mechanism).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14209", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDolibarr\u00bbDolibarrVersions  before (<) 11.0.5cpe:2.3:a:dolibarr:dolibarr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.92%  1.07%  +0.15 \n 2  2024-06-22  1.04%  0.92%  -0.12 \n 3  2024-05-20  1.05%  1.04%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-02-06  0.78%  1.05%  +0.27 \n 5  2023-10-06  0.79%  0.78%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-07-26  0.92%  0.79%  -0.13 \n 7  2023-03-07  9.68%  0.92%  -8.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/security-research-advisories/vuln/WLX-2020-012", "ref_desc": "wizlynx group | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in DolibarrThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/161955/Dolibarr-ERP-CRM-11.0.4-Bypass-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Dolibarr ERP/CRM 11.0.4 Bypass / Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/releases/tag/11.0.5", "ref_desc": "Release 11.0.5 \u00b7 Dolibarr/dolibarr \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
