{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6146", "Description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the rendering functionality of Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242 and 13.16.2.300. When drawing the contents of a page and selecting the stroke color from an 'ICCBased' colorspace, the application will read a length from the file and use it as a loop sentinel when writing data into the member of an object. Due to the object member being a buffer of a static size allocated on the heap, this can result in a heap-based buffer overflow. A specially crafted document must be loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6146", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.13.2.242cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.13.2.242:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGonitro\u00bbNitro Pro\u00bbVersion:13.16.2.300cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.16.2.300:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.37%  2.33%  +0.96 \n 2  2024-10-26  1.16%  1.37%  +0.21 \n 3  2024-01-20  1.09%  1.16%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-06-02  1.62%  1.09%  -0.53 \n 5  2023-04-23  2.29%  1.62%  -0.66 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.09%  2.29%  +1.20 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1084", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2020-1084 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
