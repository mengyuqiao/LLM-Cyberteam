{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1913", "Description": "An Integer signedness error in the JavaScript Interpreter in Facebook Hermes prior to commit 2c7af7ec481ceffd0d14ce2d7c045e475fd71dc6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service attack or a potential RCE via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1913", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermesVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.4.3cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.31%  +0.06 \n 2  2023-05-26  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-195 Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/195/Signed-to-Unsigned-Conversion-Error.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-681 Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/681/Incorrect-Conversion-between-Numeric-Types.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/2c7af7ec481ceffd0d14ce2d7c045e475fd71dc6", "ref_desc": "Fix backward branching in SwitchImm. \u00b7 facebook/hermes@2c7af7e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2020-1913", "ref_desc": "FacebookVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
