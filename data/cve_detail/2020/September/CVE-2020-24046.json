{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-24046", "Description": "A sandbox escape issue was discovered in TitanHQ SpamTitan Gateway 7.07. It limits the admin user to a restricted shell, allowing execution of a small number of tools of the operating system. This restricted shell can be bypassed after changing the properties of the user admin in the operating system file /etc/passwd. This file cannot be accessed though the restricted shell, but it can be modified by abusing the Backup/Import Backup functionality of the web interface. An authenticated attacker would be able to obtain the file /var/tmp/admin.passwd after executing a Backup operation. This file can be manually modified to change the GUID of the user to 0 (root) and change the restricted shell to a normal shell /bin/sh. After the modification is done, the file can be recompressed to a .tar.bz file and imported again via the Import Backup functionality. The properties of the admin user will be overwritten and a root shell will be granted to the user upon the next successful login.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24046", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTitanhq\u00bbSpamtitan\u00bbVersion:7.07cpe:2.3:a:titanhq:spamtitan:7.07:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.60%  1.39%  +0.79 \n 2  2024-01-21  0.59%  0.60%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-21  0.42%  0.59%  +0.17 \n 4  2023-09-06  0.32%  0.42%  +0.10 \n 5  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.32%  -1.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/felmoltor", "ref_desc": "felmoltor (Felipe Molina) \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-HgPbIA8vzjlW7hIeO4Dbp-SSYY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/felmoltor", "ref_desc": "Felipe Molina (@felmoltor) / TwitterThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cQxJcAg4R6DK7cBxs0w6kTSgt2k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sensepost.com/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/", "ref_desc": "SensePost | Clash of the (spam)titanExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fanc7JZkE6q_rvkyaPpLUrpaXT8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.titanhq.com", "ref_desc": "DNS Filter, DNS filtering, Spam Filter, Email Filter, Email Archive - ArcTitan, SpamTitan, WebTitanVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
