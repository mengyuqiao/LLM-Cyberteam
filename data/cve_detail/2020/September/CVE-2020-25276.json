{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25276", "Description": "An issue was discovered in PrimeKey EJBCA 6.x and 7.x before 7.4.1. When using a client certificate to enroll over the EST protocol, no revocation check is performed on that certificate. This vulnerability can only affect a system that has EST configured, uses client certificates to authenticate enrollment, and has had such a certificate revoked. This certificate needs to belong to a role that is authorized to enroll new end entities. (To completely mitigate this problem prior to upgrade, remove any revoked client certificates from their respective roles.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25276", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPrimekey\u00bbEjbca\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.4.1cpe:2.3:a:primekey:ejbca:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-04-18  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.primekey.com/news/posts/ejbca-security-advisory-revocation-check-not-performed-on-est-client-certificate", "ref_desc": "EJBCA Security Advisory - Revocation check not performed on EST client certificate - News / PrimeKey Announcements - PrimeKey SupportVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
