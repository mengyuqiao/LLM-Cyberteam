{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1749", "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of some networking protocols in IPsec, such as VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels over IPv6. When an encrypted tunnel is created between two hosts, the kernel isn't correctly routing tunneled data over the encrypted link; rather sending the data unencrypted. This would allow anyone in between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1749", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Mrg\u00bbVersion:2.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_mrg:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.14%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-05-26  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-04-16  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201222-0001/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-1749 Linux Kernel Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1749", "ref_desc": "1809833 \u2013 (CVE-2020-1749) CVE-2020-1749 kernel: some ipv6 protocols not encrypted over ipsec tunnel.Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
