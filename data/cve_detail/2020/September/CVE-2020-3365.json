{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3365", "Description": "A vulnerability in the directory permissions of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory traversal attack on a limited set of restricted directories. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the logic that governs directory permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using capabilities that are not controlled by the role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms of the software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on an affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3365", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Network Function Virtualization InfrastructureVersions  from including (>=) 3.5.1andup to, including, (<=) 4.1.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_network_function_virtualization_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.09%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nfvis-path-emy79OC2", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software Path Traversal VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
