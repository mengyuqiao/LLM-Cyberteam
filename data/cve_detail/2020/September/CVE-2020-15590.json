{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15590", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client for Linux 1.5 through 2.3+ allows remote attackers to bypass an intended VPN kill switch mechanism and read sensitive information via intercepting network traffic. Since 1.5, PIA has supported a \u201csplit tunnel\u201d OpenVPN bypass option. The PIA killswitch & associated iptables firewall is designed to protect you while using the Internet. When the kill switch is configured to block all inbound and outbound network traffic, privileged applications can continue sending & receiving network traffic if net.ipv4.ip_forward has been enabled in the system kernel parameters. For example, a Docker container running on a host with the VPN turned off, and the kill switch turned on, can continue using the internet, leaking the host IP (CWE 200). In PIA 2.4.0+, policy-based routing is enabled by default and is used to direct all forwarded packets to the VPN interface automatically.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15590", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPrivateinternetaccess\u00bbPrivate Internet Access Vpn Client\u00bbForLinuxVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:privateinternetaccess:private_internet_access_vpn_client:*:*:*:*:*:linux:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.82%  1.58%  +0.76 \n 2  2024-06-01  0.69%  0.82%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.56%  0.69%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-01-18  0.47%  0.56%  +0.10 \n 5  2023-05-31  0.42%  0.47%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-04-21  0.34%  0.42%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.34%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sick.codes/cve-2020-15590/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-15590 - Private Internet Access VPN for Linux \u2013 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor - Sick Codes - Linux, NetSec, VPS, Arch, Debian, CentOS Tweaks & Tips!Exploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sickcodes", "ref_desc": "sickcodes \u00b7 GitHubNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dRc3gnTog4lsvrzAY4rSwFAYEOM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sickcodes/security/blob/master/advisories/SICK-2020-001.md", "ref_desc": "security/SICK-2020-001.md at master \u00b7 sickcodes/security \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
