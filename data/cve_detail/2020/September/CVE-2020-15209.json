{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15209", "Description": "In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, a crafted TFLite model can force a node to have as input a tensor backed by a `nullptr` buffer. This can be achieved by changing a buffer index in the flatbuffer serialization to convert a read-only tensor to a read-write one. The runtime assumes that these buffers are written to before a possible read, hence they are initialized with `nullptr`. However, by changing the buffer index for a tensor and implicitly converting that tensor to be a read-write one, as there is nothing in the model that writes to it, we get a null pointer dereference. The issue is patched in commit 0b5662bc, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15209", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andbefore (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  before (<) 1.15.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bb     LiteEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:lite:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.2cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-02  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.14%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0b5662bc2be13a8c8f044d925d87fb6e56247cd8", "ref_desc": "[tflite] Ensure input tensors don't have `nullptr` buffers. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@0b5662b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-qh32-6jjc-qprm", "ref_desc": "Null pointer dereference in TFLite \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.3.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ortjngyi56v7lluowJssSjRFy_Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1766-1: moderate: Security update fMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wCL-WJMvXAseFrdJPj9KkoNFedE.html"}]}
