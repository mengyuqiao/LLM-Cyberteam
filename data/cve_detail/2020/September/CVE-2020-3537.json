{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3537", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber for Windows software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages that contain Universal Naming Convention (UNC) links to a targeted user and convincing the user to follow the provided link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to access a remote system, possibly allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive information that the attacker could use in additional attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3537", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.1andbefore (<) 12.1.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.9andbefore (<) 12.9.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.5andbefore (<) 12.5.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.6andbefore (<) 12.6.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.7andbefore (<) 12.7.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbJabber\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 12.8andbefore (<) 12.8.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:jabber:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-14  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-05-20  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.09%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-jabber-G3NSjPn7", "ref_desc": "Cisco Jabber for Windows Universal Naming Convention Link Handling VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
