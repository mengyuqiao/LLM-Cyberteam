This vulnerability could allow JavaScript code to be executed in the user's web browser if the user is convinced to visit a crafted URL, possibly through phishing. Successful exploitation requires specific knowledge about the user\u2019s network to be included in the crafted URL. Impact is limited to the normal access restrictions and permissions of the user clicking the crafted URL, and subject to the user being able to connect to and already being authenticated to IMM2 or other systems. The JavaScript code is not executed on IMM2 itself.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8340", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nLenovo\u00bbIntegrated Management Module 2Versions  before (<) 5.60cpe:2.3:o:lenovo:integrated_management_module_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System Nx360 M5\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X240\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X280 X6\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X3250 M6\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X3500 M5\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X3550 M5\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X3650 M5\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X3750 M4\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X3850 X6\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X3950 X6\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X440\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X480 X6\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X880 X6\u00bbVersion:N/A\nLenovo\u00bbIntegrated Management Module 2Versions  before (<) 5.61cpe:2.3:o:lenovo:integrated_management_module_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Lenovo\u00bbFlex System X240 M5\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/LEN-44717", "ref_desc": "XSS Vulnerability in Legacy System x IMM2 - Lenovo Support USVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
