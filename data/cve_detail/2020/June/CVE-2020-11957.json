{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11957", "Description": "The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation in Cypress PSoC Creator BLE 4.2 component versions before 3.64 generates a random number (Pairing Random) with significantly less entropy than the specified 128 bits during BLE pairing. This is the case for both authenticated and unauthenticated pairing with both LE Secure Connections as well as LE Legacy Pairing. A predictable or brute-forceable random number allows an attacker (in radio range) to perform a MITM attack during BLE pairing.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11957", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCypress\u00bbPsoc 4.2 BleVersions  before (<) 3.64cpe:2.3:a:cypress:psoc_4.2_ble:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/331/Insufficient-Entropy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cypress.com/file/504466/download", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
