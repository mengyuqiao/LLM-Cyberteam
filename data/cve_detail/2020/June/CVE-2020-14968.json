{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14968", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the jsrsasign package before 8.0.17 for Node.js. Its RSASSA-PSS (RSA-PSS) implementation does not detect signature manipulation/modification by prepending '\\0' bytes to a signature (it accepts these modified signatures as valid). An attacker can abuse this behavior in an application by creating multiple valid signatures where only one signature should exist. Also, an attacker might prepend these bytes with the goal of triggering memory corruption issues.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14968", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nNetapp\u00bbMax Data\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:max_data:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJsrsasign Project\u00bbJsrsasign\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 8.0.17cpe:2.3:a:jsrsasign_project:jsrsasign:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.63%  1.32%  -0.31 \n 2  2024-10-16  1.66%  1.63%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-05-13  1.22%  1.66%  +0.43 \n 4  2023-11-10  1.40%  1.22%  -0.18 \n 5  2023-05-08  1.15%  1.40%  +0.25 \n 6  2023-03-08  1.04%  1.15%  +0.11 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.11%  1.04%  -0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.18", "ref_desc": "Release RSA decryption and RSA signature validation maleability fix \u00b7 kjur/jsrsasign \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6o1rO7Wa-UUcAN1AX5muDFBad7M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign", "ref_desc": "jsrsasign - npmProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/916GJmNHA7HNTFPm9GAqLMVkQxo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.17", "ref_desc": "Release RSAPSS verification maleability fix and others \u00b7 kjur/jsrsasign \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bdYKBWQkAe_la_r3EiEp6EChAB0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/438", "ref_desc": "The RSA-PSS implementation does not detect signature modification (prepending \"0\" bytes) to the signature \u00b7 Issue #438 \u00b7 kjur/jsrsasign \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200724-0001/", "ref_desc": "June 2020 Node.js Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/voRsq4ZUGLYuVSQy5PSRJot0vyE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/", "ref_desc": "jsrsasign - cryptography library in JavaScriptRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Y8drkhnzovwRPNhRbZPxmYn2sUI.html"}]}
