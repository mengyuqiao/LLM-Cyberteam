{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3242", "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to obtain confidential information from an affected device. The vulnerability exists because confidential information is returned as part of an API response. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the API key of another user, which would allow the attacker to impersonate the account of that user on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative privileges on the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3242", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUcs DirectorVersions  before (<) 6.7.4.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-04-06  0.15%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-03-04  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucsd-info-disclosure-gSMU8EKT", "ref_desc": "Cisco UCS Director Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
