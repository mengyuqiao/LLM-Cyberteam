{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3290", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Series Routers and Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, and RV082 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a stack overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3290", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv320 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.5.1.05cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv320_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv320\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv325 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.5.1.05cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv325_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv325\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv016 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.3.10cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv016_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv016\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv042 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.3.10cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv042_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv042\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv042g FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.3.10cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv042g_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv042g\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv082 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.3.10cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv082_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv082\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-06  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 2  2024-02-15  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.14%  -1.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-routers-stack-vUxHmnNz", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Stack Overflow Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7XyUDbV3Sok3iwokMWEajbbRauw.html"}]}
