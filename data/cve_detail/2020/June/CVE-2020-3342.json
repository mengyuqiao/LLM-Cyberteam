{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3342", "Description": "A vulnerability in the software update feature of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Mac could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of cryptographic protections on files that are downloaded by the application as part of a software update. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to go to a website that returns files to the client that are similar to files that are returned from a valid Webex website. The client may fail to properly validate the cryptographic protections of the provided files before executing them as part of an update. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3342", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings\u00bb     DesktopEditionForMac OsVersions  before (<) 39.5.11cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:desktop:mac_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.53% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.37%  0.53%  +0.16 \n 2  2024-04-06  0.33%  0.37%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-03-04  0.34%  0.33%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-05-24  0.33%  0.34%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.33%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-client-mac-X7vp65BL", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Mac Update Feature Code Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
