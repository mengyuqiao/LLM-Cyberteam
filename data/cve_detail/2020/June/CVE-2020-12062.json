{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12062", "Description": "The scp client in OpenSSH 8.2 incorrectly sends duplicate responses to the server upon a utimes system call failure, which allows a malicious unprivileged user on the remote server to overwrite arbitrary files in the client's download directory by creating a crafted subdirectory anywhere on the remote server. The victim must use the command scp -rp to download a file hierarchy containing, anywhere inside, this crafted subdirectory. NOTE: the vendor points out that \"this attack can achieve no more than a hostile peer is already able to achieve within the scp protocol\" and \"utimes does not fail under normal circumstances.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12062", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenbsd\u00bbOpenssh\u00bbVersion:8.2cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:8.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-04-05  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 3  2024-03-21  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.11%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/aad87b88fc2536b1ea023213729aaf4eaabe1894", "ref_desc": "upstream: when receving a file in sink(), be careful to send at \u00b7 openssh/openssh-portable@aad87b8 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.3", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/05/27/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Announce: OpenSSH 8.3 releasedMailing List;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/955854cafca88e0cdcd3d09ca1ad4ada465364a1", "ref_desc": "upstream: another case where a utimes() failure could make scp send \u00b7 openssh/openssh-portable@955854c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
