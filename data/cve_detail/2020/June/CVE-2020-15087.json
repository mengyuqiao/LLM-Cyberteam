{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15087", "Description": "In Presto before version 337, authenticated users can bypass authorization checks by directly accessing internal APIs. This impacts Presto server installations with secure internal communication configured. This does not affect installations that have not configured secure internal communication, as these installations are inherently insecure. This only affects Presto server installations. This does NOT affect clients such as the CLI or JDBC driver. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 337. Additionally, this issue can be mitigated by blocking network access to internal APIs on the coordinator and workers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15087", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPrestosql\u00bbPrestoVersions  before (<) 337cpe:2.3:a:prestosql:presto:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://trino.io/docs/current/release/release-337.html#security-changes", "ref_desc": "Release 337 (25 Jun 2020) \u2014 Trino 354 DocumentationRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/prestosql/presto/security/advisories/GHSA-f6pc-crhh-cp96", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation for internal APIs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 prestosql/presto \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
