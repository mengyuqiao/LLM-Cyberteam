{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12885", "Description": "An infinite loop was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options() parses CoAP options in a while loop. This loop's exit condition is computed using the previously allocated heap memory required for storing the result of parsing multiple options. If the input heap memory calculation results in zero bytes, the loop exit condition is never met and the loop is not terminated. As a result, the packet parsing function never exits, leading to resource consumption.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12885", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nARM\u00bbMbed Os\u00bbVersion:5.15.3cpe:2.3:o:arm:mbed_os:5.15.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/pull/116", "ref_desc": "Bugfix/coap parser mem access bugs by mjurczak \u00b7 Pull Request #116 \u00b7 ARMmbed/mbed-coap \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B7ILbZKq1E0svdYFqazihHhhX2s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/12929", "ref_desc": "Infinite loop in MbedOS CoAP library parser \u00b7 Issue #12929 \u00b7 ARMmbed/mbed-os \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
