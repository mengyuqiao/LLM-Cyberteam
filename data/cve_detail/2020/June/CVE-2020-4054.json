{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-4054", "Description": "In Sanitize (RubyGem sanitize) greater than or equal to 3.0.0 and less than 5.2.1, there is a cross-site scripting vulnerability. When HTML is sanitized using Sanitize's \"relaxed\" config, or a custom config that allows certain elements, some content in a math or svg element may not be sanitized correctly even if math and svg are not in the allowlist. You are likely to be vulnerable to this issue if you use Sanitize's relaxed config or a custom config that allows one or more of the following HTML elements: iframe, math, noembed, noframes, noscript, plaintext, script, style, svg, xmp. Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML through Sanitize, potentially resulting in XSS (cross-site scripting) or other undesired behavior when that HTML is rendered in a browser. This has been fixed in 5.2.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4054", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSanitize Project\u00bbSanitize\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 5.2.1cpe:2.3:a:sanitize_project:sanitize:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-20  0.15%  0.14%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.15%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4543-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-4543-1: Sanitize vulnerability | Ubuntu security notices | Ubuntu", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/commit/a11498de9e283cd457b35ee252983662f7452aa9", "ref_desc": "Fix sanitization bypass in HTML foreign content \u00b7 rgrove/sanitize@a11498d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/security/advisories/GHSA-p4x4-rw2p-8j8m", "ref_desc": "HTML sanitization bypass in Sanitize \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rgrove/sanitize \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4730", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4730-1 ruby-sanitize", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/releases/tag/v5.2.1", "ref_desc": "Release v5.2.1 \u00b7 rgrove/sanitize \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
