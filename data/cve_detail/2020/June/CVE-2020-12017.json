{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12017", "Description": "GE Grid Solutions Reason RT Clocks, RT430, RT431, and RT434, all firmware versions prior to 08A05. The device\u2019s vulnerability in the web application could allow multiple unauthenticated attacks that could cause serious impact. The vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands and send a request to a specific URL that could cause the device to become unresponsive. The unauthenticated attacker may change the password of the 'configuration' user account, allowing the attacker to modify the configuration of the device via the web interface using the new password. This vulnerability may also allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the authentication required to configure the device and reboot the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12017", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGE\u00bbRt430 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 08a05cpe:2.3:o:ge:rt430_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:GE\u00bbRt430\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGE\u00bbRt431 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 08a05cpe:2.3:o:ge:rt431_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:GE\u00bbRt431\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGE\u00bbRt434 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 08a05cpe:2.3:o:ge:rt434_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:GE\u00bbRt434\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.22%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-154-05", "ref_desc": "GE Grid Solutions Reason RT Clocks | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
