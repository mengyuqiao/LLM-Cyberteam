{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3206", "Description": "A vulnerability in the handling of IEEE 802.11w Protected Management Frames (PMFs) of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers that are running Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to terminate a valid user connection to an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate 802.11w disassociation and deauthentication PMFs that it receives. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a spoofed 802.11w PMF from a valid, authenticated client on a network adjacent to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate a single valid user connection to the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3206", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.10.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.10.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.10.1ecpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.10.1e:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.10.1scpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.10.1s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewlc-dos-AnvKvMxR", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers Denial of Service VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
