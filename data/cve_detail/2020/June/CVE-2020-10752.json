This flaw allows an attacker with the ability to cause an API Server error to read the logs, and use the leaked OAuthToken to log into the API Server with the leaked token.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10752", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container Platform\u00bbVersion:3.11cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container Platform\u00bbVersion:4.0cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/323", "ref_desc": "WIP: enhancements: Secure OAuth Resource Storage by sttts \u00b7 Pull Request #323 \u00b7 openshift/enhancements \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/filters/wrap.go#L39", "ref_desc": "origin/wrap.go at master \u00b7 openshift/origin \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
