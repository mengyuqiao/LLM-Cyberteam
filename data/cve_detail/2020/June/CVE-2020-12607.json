{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12607", "Description": "An issue was discovered in fastecdsa before 2.1.2. When using the NIST P-256 curve in the ECDSA implementation, the point at infinity is mishandled. This means that for an extreme value in k and s^-1, the signature verification fails even if the signature is correct. This behavior is not solely a usability problem. There are some threat models where an attacker can benefit by successfully guessing users for whom signature verification will fail.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12607", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFastecdsa Project\u00bbFastecdsaVersions  before (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:fastecdsa_project:fastecdsa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.21%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.24%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/commit/4a16daeaf139be20654ef58a9fe4c79dc030458c", "ref_desc": "Update CHANGELOG.md \u00b7 AntonKueltz/fastecdsa@4a16dae \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/issues/52", "ref_desc": "ECDSA verification fails for extreme value in k and s^-1 (P-256, SHA-256) \u00b7 Issue #52 \u00b7 AntonKueltz/fastecdsa \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/commit/7b64e3efaa806b4daaf73bb5172af3581812f8de", "ref_desc": "Update docs to v2.1.2 \u00b7 AntonKueltz/fastecdsa@7b64e3e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/commit/e592f106edd5acf6dacedfab2ad16fe6c735c9d1", "ref_desc": "Properly handle the point at infinity \u00b7 AntonKueltz/fastecdsa@e592f10 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
