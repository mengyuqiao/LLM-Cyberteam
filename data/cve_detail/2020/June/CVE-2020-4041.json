{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-4041", "Description": "In Bolt CMS before version 3.7.1, the filename of uploaded files was vulnerable to stored XSS. It is not possible to inject javascript code in the file name when creating/uploading the file. But, once created/uploaded, it can be renamed to inject the payload in it. Additionally, the measures to prevent renaming the file to disallowed filename extensions could be circumvented. This is fixed in Bolt 3.7.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4041", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBoltcms\u00bbBoltVersions  before (<) 3.7.1cpe:2.3:a:boltcms:bolt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.62%  0.26%  -0.37 \n 2  2024-02-24  0.48%  0.62%  +0.14 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.48%  -0.54 \n 4  2023-02-22  4.13%  1.02%  -3.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bolt/bolt/pull/7853", "ref_desc": "Check CSRF on Preview page by bobdenotter \u00b7 Pull Request #7853 \u00b7 bolt/bolt \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dFUbCmtlXJ4d_bKRLy6JldhwYOY.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Jul/4", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Bolt CMS <= 3.7.0 Multiple Vulnerabilities - CSRF to RCEExploit;Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/K0f5kFIeqy4_rhtBnbPP0qASiRs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bolt/bolt/security/advisories/GHSA-68q3-7wjp-7q3j", "ref_desc": "The filename of uploaded files vulnerable to stored XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bolt/bolt \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158299/Bolt-CMS-3.7.0-XSS-CSRF-Shell-Upload.html", "ref_desc": "Bolt CMS 3.7.0 XSS / CSRF / Shell Upload \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qa_fccs0QEWDLdSgoVIX9TsmG7A.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bolt/bolt/commit/b42cbfcf3e3108c46a80581216ba03ef449e419f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #7853 from bolt/fix/csrf-check-on-preview \u00b7 bolt/bolt@b42cbfc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/T2JdI2tvpzPm2mvAaI0Cu8b9eAA.html"}]}
