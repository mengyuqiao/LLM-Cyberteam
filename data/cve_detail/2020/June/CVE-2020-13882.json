The routine to check the log and report file permissions was not working as intended and could be bypassed locally. Because of the race, an unprivileged attacker can set up a log and report file, and control that up to the point where the specific routine is doing its check. After that, the file can be removed, recreated, and used for additional attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13882", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:31cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisofy\u00bbLynisVersions  before (<) 3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:cisofy:lynis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDCHEKNR3HPJRNHE5PYKFH5GNBADTPA7/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: lynis-3.0.0-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Aglnvp9MpwkePVToyM9gDdBHSqo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://cisofy.com/security/cve/cve-2020-13882/", "ref_desc": "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) - CVE-2020-13882 - CISOfyVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UBFHIX6RTHCK37FXMAAXP4KGAMLUFDUD/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: lynis-3.0.0-1.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KUGIiKfdhhYYDR6KZc9ByuT2Rdg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html", "ref_desc": "CWE - CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (4.5)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
