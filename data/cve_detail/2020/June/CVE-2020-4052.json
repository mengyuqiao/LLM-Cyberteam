{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-4052", "Description": "In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. This has been patched in 2.4.107.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4052", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRequarks\u00bbWiki.jsVersions  before (<) 2.4.107cpe:2.3:a:requarks:wiki.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-9jgg-4xj2-vjjj", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS through template injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/9e08718ee904046f8b2294ef6ac79e8a75a451e3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-9jgg-4xj2-vjjj \u00b7 Requarks/wiki@9e08718 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
