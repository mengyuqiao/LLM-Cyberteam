{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3336", "Description": "A vulnerability in the software upgrade process of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify the filesystem to cause a denial of service (DoS) or gain privileged access to the root filesystem. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending requests with malformed parameters to the system using the console, Secure Shell (SSH), or web API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the device configuration or cause a DoS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3336", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Collaboration EndpointVersions  before (<) 9.9.4cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_collaboration_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Collaboration EndpointVersions  from including (>=) 9.12.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.12.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_collaboration_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Collaboration EndpointVersions  from including (>=) 9.10.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.10.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_collaboration_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbRoomos\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:roomos:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.41%  0.29%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-07-27  0.29%  0.41%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-03-04  0.30%  0.29%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.30%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-tp-cmd-inj-7ZpWhvZb", "ref_desc": "Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint and RoomOS Software Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
