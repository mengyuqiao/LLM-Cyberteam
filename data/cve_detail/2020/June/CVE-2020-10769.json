{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10769", "Description": "A buffer over-read flaw was found in RH kernel versions before 5.0 in crypto_authenc_extractkeys in crypto/authenc.c in the IPsec Cryptographic algorithm's module, authenc. When a payload longer than 4 bytes, and is not following 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines, it causes a buffer over-read threat, leading to a system crash. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to cause a denial of service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10769", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 \n 2  2023-02-13  1.28%  0.95%  -0.33 \n 3  2023-02-03  0.95%  1.28%  +0.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/1/21/675", "ref_desc": "LKML: Greg Kroah-Hartman: [PATCH 4.14 21/59] crypto: authenc - fix parsing key with misaligned rta_lenExploit;Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KJDCOGYEK3rfwS9jVnGEjir-Aa4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00009.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1153-1: important: Security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SAPigNxmayKIlpzXartIDo-1Z1g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1708775%3B", "ref_desc": "Invalid Bug ID", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
