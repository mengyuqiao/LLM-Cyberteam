{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-4045", "Description": "SSB-DB version 20.0.0 has an information disclosure vulnerability. The get() method is supposed to only decrypt messages when you explicitly ask it to, but there is a bug where it's decrypting any message that it can. This means that it is returning the decrypted content of private messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to private data. This only affects peers running SSB-DB@20.0.0 who also have private messages, and is only known to be exploitable if you're also running SSB-OOO (default in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin wrapper around get() to anonymous peers. This is fixed in version 20.0.1. Note that users of SSB-Server verion 16.0.0 should upgrade to 16.0.1 to get the fixed version of SSB-DB.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4045", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nScuttlebutt\u00bbSsb-db\u00bbVersion:20.0.0cpe:2.3:a:scuttlebutt:ssb-db:20.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-04-20  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/commit/43334d0871c9cc6220e0f6d6338499060f7761d4", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/security/advisories/GHSA-mpgr-2cx9-327h", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
