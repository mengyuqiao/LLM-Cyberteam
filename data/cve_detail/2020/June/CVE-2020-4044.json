{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-4044", "Description": "The xrdp-sesman service before version 0.9.13.1 can be crashed by connecting over port 3350 and supplying a malicious payload. Once the xrdp-sesman process is dead, an unprivileged attacker on the server could then proceed to start their own imposter sesman service listening on port 3350. This will allow them to capture any user credentials that are submitted to XRDP and approve or reject arbitrary login credentials. For xorgxrdp sessions in particular, this allows an unauthorized user to hijack an existing session. This is a buffer overflow attack, so there may be a risk of arbitrary code execution as well.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4044", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nNeutrinolabs\u00bbXrdpVersions  before (<) 0.9.13.1cpe:2.3:a:neutrinolabs:xrdp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.51%  0.06%  -1.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00036.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0999-1: important: Security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/security/advisories/GHSA-j9fv-6fwf-p3g4", "ref_desc": "Local users can perform a buffer overflow attack against the xrdp-sesman service and then impersonate it \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 neutrinolabs/xrdp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/commit/0c791d073d0eb344ee7aaafd221513dc9226762c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-j9fv-6fwf-p3g4 \u00b7 neutrinolabs/xrdp@0c791d0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00037.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1200-1: important: Security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4737", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4737-1 xrdp", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/08/msg00015.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2319-1] xrdp security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/releases/tag/v0.9.13.1", "ref_desc": "Release xrdp v0.9.13.1 \u00b7 neutrinolabs/xrdp \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
