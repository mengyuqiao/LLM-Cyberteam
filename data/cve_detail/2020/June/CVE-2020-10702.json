{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10702", "Description": "A flaw was found in QEMU in the implementation of the Pointer Authentication (PAuth) support for ARM introduced in version 4.0 and fixed in version 5.0.0. A general failure of the signature generation process caused every PAuth-enforced pointer to be signed with the same signature. A local attacker could obtain the signature of a protected pointer and abuse this flaw to bypass PAuth protection for all programs running on QEMU.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10702", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nQemu\u00bbQemuVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:qemu:qemu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-325 Missing Cryptographic Step", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/325/Missing-Cryptographic-Step.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=de0b1bae6461f67243282555475f88b2384a1eb9", "ref_desc": "git.qemu.org Git - qemu.git/commitVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200724-0007/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-10702 QEMU Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-10702", "ref_desc": "1809948 \u2013 (CVE-2020-10702) CVE-2020-10702 qemu: weak signature generation in Pointer Authentication support for ARMIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
