{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5299", "Description": "In OctoberCMS (october/october composer package) versions from 1.0.319 and before 1.0.466, any users with the ability to modify any data that could eventually be exported as a CSV file from the `ImportExportController` could potentially introduce a CSV injection into the data to cause the generated CSV export file to be malicious. This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful attack can be completed: 1. Have found a vulnerability in the victims spreadsheet software of choice. 2. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim. 3. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks by said software. Issue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5299", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.319andbefore (<) 1.0.466cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c84bf03f506052c848f2fddc05f24be631427a1a", "ref_desc": "Temporary workaround until the L6 upgrade can be merged in to use lea\u2026 \u00b7 octobercms/library@c84bf03 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-4rhm-m2fp-hx7q", "ref_desc": "Potential CSV Injection vector \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Aug/2", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: October CMS <= Build 465 Multiple Vulnerabilities - Arbitrary File ReadMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/T_7cyUEPRCY53ANp6r3q2QwOAs8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/802d8c8e09a2b342649393edb6d3ceb958851484", "ref_desc": "Temporary workaround until the L6 upgrade can be merged in to use lea\u2026 \u00b7 octobercms/october@802d8c8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158730/October-CMS-Build-465-XSS-File-Read-File-Deletion-CSV-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "October CMS Build 465 XSS / File Read / File Deletion / CSV Injection \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wMg34UsAzUwE_a8V8OOa9FdSl4Y.html"}]}
