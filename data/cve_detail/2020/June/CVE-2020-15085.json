{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15085", "Description": "In Saleor Storefront before version 2.10.3, request data used to authenticate customers was inadvertently cached in the browser's local storage mechanism, including credentials. A malicious user with direct access to the browser could extract the email and password. In versions prior to 2.10.0 persisted the cache even after the user logged out. This is fixed in version 2.10.3. A workaround is to manually clear application data (browser's local storage) after logging into Saleor Storefront.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15085", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMirumee\u00bbSaleorVersions  before (<) 2.10.3cpe:2.3:a:mirumee:saleor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-storefront/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2103", "ref_desc": "saleor-storefront/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 mirumee/saleor-storefront \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-storefront/security/advisories/GHSA-4279-h39w-2jqm", "ref_desc": "Client caching login operation with plaintext password \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mirumee/saleor-storefront \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-storefront/commit/7c331e1be805022c9a7be719bd69d050b2577458", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-4279-h39w-2jqm \u00b7 mirumee/saleor-storefront@7c331e1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
