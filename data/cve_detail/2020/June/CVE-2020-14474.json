{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14474", "Description": "The Cellebrite UFED physical device 5.0 through 7.5.0.845 relies on key material hardcoded within both the executable code supporting the decryption process, and within the encrypted files themselves by using a key enveloping technique. The recovered key material is the same for every device running the same version of the software, and does not appear to be changed with each new build. It is possible to reconstruct the decryption process using the hardcoded key material and obtain easy access to otherwise protected data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14474", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCellebrite\u00bbUfed FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.5.0.845cpe:2.3:o:cellebrite:ufed_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cellebrite\u00bbUfed\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.57%  0.37%  -3.20 \n 2  2024-08-09  1.81%  3.57%  +1.76 \n 3  2024-07-24  1.29%  1.81%  +0.53 \n 4  2023-12-04  1.32%  1.29%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-11-03  1.29%  1.32%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-23  1.32%  1.29%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  1.32%  +0.36 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Jun/31", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: KL-001-2020-003 : Cellebrite EPR Decryption Relies on Hardcoded AES Key MaterialExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-003.txt", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158254/Cellebrite-EPR-Decryption-Hardcoded-AES-Key-Material.html", "ref_desc": "Cellebrite EPR Decryption Hardcoded AES Key Material \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
