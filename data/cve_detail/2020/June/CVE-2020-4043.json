{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-4043", "Description": "phpMussel from versions 1.0.0 and less than 1.6.0 has an unserialization vulnerability in PHP's phar wrapper. Uploading a specially crafted file to an affected version allows arbitrary code execution (discovered, tested, and confirmed by myself), so the risk factor should be regarded as very high. Newer phpMussel versions don't use PHP's phar wrapper, and are therefore unaffected. This has been fixed in version 1.6.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4043", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPhpmussel Project\u00bbPhpmusselVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.6.0cpe:2.3:a:phpmussel_project:phpmussel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.56%  +0.21 \n 2  2024-06-03  0.41%  0.34%  -0.06 \n 3  2024-04-14  0.42%  0.41%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-03-30  0.40%  0.42%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-26  0.29%  0.40%  +0.11 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.29%  -2.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/167", "ref_desc": "Phar unserialization vulnerability. \u00b7 Issue #167 \u00b7 phpMussel/phpMussel \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/security/advisories/GHSA-qr95-4mq5-r3fh", "ref_desc": "Phar unserialization vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 phpMussel/phpMussel \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/security/policy#currently-known-vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "Security Policy \u00b7 phpMussel/phpMussel \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/pull/173", "ref_desc": "Archive overhaul. by Maikuolan \u00b7 Pull Request #173 \u00b7 phpMussel/phpMussel \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/commit/97f25973433921c1f953430f32d3081adc4851a4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #173 from phpMussel/archive-overhaul \u00b7 phpMussel/phpMussel@97f2597 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
