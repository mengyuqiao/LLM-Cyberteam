{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13443", "Description": "ExpressionEngine before 5.3.2 allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code in a .php%20 file via Compose Msg, Add attachment, and Save As Draft actions. A user with low privileges (member) is able to upload this. It is possible to bypass the MIME type check and file-extension check while uploading new files. Short aliases are not used for an attachment; instead, direct access is allowed to the uploaded files. It is possible to upload PHP only if one has member access, or registration/forum is enabled and one can create a member with the default group id of 5. To exploit this, one must to be able to send and compose messages (at least).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13443", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nExpressionengine\u00bbExpressionengineVersions  before (<) 5.3.2cpe:2.3:a:expressionengine:expressionengine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.46%  0.58%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-08-03  0.48%  0.46%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-04-13  0.43%  0.48%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-10-28  0.40%  0.43%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.40%  -1.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/mariuszpoplwski/51604d8a6d7d78fffdf590c25e844e09", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-13443 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://expressionengine.com/blog", "ref_desc": "Blog | ExpressionEngineVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
