{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12884", "Description": "A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options() parses CoAP options that may occur multiple consecutive times in a single packet. While processing the options, packet_data_pptr is accessed after being incremented by option_len without a prior out-of-bounds memory check. The temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is validated for a correct range, but the range valid for temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is derived from the amount of allocated heap memory, not the actual input size. Therefore the check of temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr may be insufficient for safe access to the area pointed to by packet_data_pptr. As a result, access to a memory area outside of the intended boundary of the packet buffer is made.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12884", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nARM\u00bbMbed Os\u00bbVersion:5.15.3cpe:2.3:o:arm:mbed_os:5.15.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/pull/116", "ref_desc": "Bugfix/coap parser mem access bugs by mjurczak \u00b7 Pull Request #116 \u00b7 ARMmbed/mbed-coap \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B7ILbZKq1E0svdYFqazihHhhX2s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/12928", "ref_desc": "Out of range memory access in MbedOS CoAP library parser - sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options \u00b7 Issue #12928 \u00b7 ARMmbed/mbed-os \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
