{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14971", "Description": "Pi-hole through 5.0 allows code injection in piholedhcp (the Static DHCP Leases section) by modifying Teleporter backup files and then restoring them. This occurs in settings.php. To exploit this, an attacker would request a backup of limited files via teleporter.php. These are placed into a .tar.gz archive. The attacker then modifies the host parameter in dnsmasq.d files, and then compresses and uploads these files again.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14971", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPi-hole\u00bbPi-holeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.0cpe:2.3:a:pi-hole:pi-hole:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/commit/c949516ee15fa6a9b0c8511cc4c4d6b0893f3e69", "ref_desc": "make use of utils.escapeHtml on the JS side of things, and html_entit\u2026 \u00b7 pi-hole/AdminLTE@c949516 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/commit/8f6e1365b6dec0ae1aa0b0b15b102c9133f347e5", "ref_desc": "missed one (yes yes this can all be squashed) \u00b7 pi-hole/AdminLTE@8f6e136 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/pull/1443", "ref_desc": "Prevent possible XSS attack vector in the input fields of the group section by PromoFaux \u00b7 Pull Request #1443 \u00b7 pi-hole/AdminLTE \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.telspace.co.za/2020/06/pi-hole-code-injection-cve-2020-14971.html", "ref_desc": "Telspace Systems, The Blog: Pi-hole Code Injection \u2013 CVE-2020-14971\u2013 Story TimeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
