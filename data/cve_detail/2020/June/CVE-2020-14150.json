NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and an observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug reports were intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14150", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbBisonVersions  before (<) 3.5.4cpe:2.3:a:gnu:bison:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.gentoo.org/717936", "ref_desc": "717936 \u2013 (CVE-2020-14150) <sys-devel/bison-3.5.4: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-14150)Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2020-04/msg00000.html", "ref_desc": "Bison 3.5.4 releasedMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
