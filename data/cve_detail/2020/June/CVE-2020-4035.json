{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-4035", "Description": "In WatermelonDB (NPM package \"@nozbe/watermelondb\") before versions 0.15.1 and 0.16.2, a maliciously crafted record ID can exploit a SQL Injection vulnerability in iOS adapter implementation and cause the app to delete all or selected records from the database, generally causing the app to become unusable. This may happen in apps that don't validate IDs (valid IDs are `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+$/`) and use Watermelon Sync or low-level `database.adapter.destroyDeletedRecords` method. The integrity risk is low due to the fact that maliciously deleted records won't synchronize, so logout-login will restore all data, although some local changes may be lost if the malicious deletion causes the sync process to fail to proceed to push stage. No way to breach confidentiality with this vulnerability is known. Full exploitation of SQL Injection is mitigated, because it's not possible to nest an insert/update query inside a delete query in SQLite, and it's not possible to pass a semicolon-separated second query. There's also no known practicable way to breach confidentiality by selectively deleting records, because those records will not be synchronized. It's theoretically possible that selective record deletion could cause an app to behave insecurely if lack of a record is used to make security decisions by the app. This is patched in versions 0.15.1, 0.16.2, and 0.16.1-fix", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4035", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nNozbe\u00bbWatermelondbVersions  before (<) 0.15.1cpe:2.3:a:nozbe:watermelondb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNozbe\u00bbWatermelondb\u00bbVersion:0.16.0cpe:2.3:a:nozbe:watermelondb:0.16.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNozbe\u00bbWatermelondb\u00bbVersion:0.16.1cpe:2.3:a:nozbe:watermelondb:0.16.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/commit/924c7ae2a8d7d6459656751e5b9b1bf91a218025", "ref_desc": "Fix destroyDeletedRecords vulnerability \u00b7 Nozbe/WatermelonDB@924c7ae \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/security/advisories/GHSA-38f9-m297-6q9g", "ref_desc": "DoS or local data modification via malicious record IDs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Nozbe/WatermelonDB \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
