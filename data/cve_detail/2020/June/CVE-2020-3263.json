{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3263", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute programs on an affected end-user system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of input that is supplied to application URLs. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to execute other programs that are already present on the end-user system. If malicious files are planted on the system or on an accessible network file path, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the affected system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3263", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings\u00bb     DesktopEditionVersions  before (<) 39.5.12cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:desktop:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-04  0.24%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-05-24  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.23%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-client-url-fcmpdfVY", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App URL Filtering Arbitrary Program Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
