{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12852", "Description": "The update feature for Pydio Cells 2.0.4 allows an administrator user to set a custom update URL and the public RSA key used to validate the downloaded update package. The update process involves downloading the updated binary file from a URL indicated in the update server response, validating its checksum and signature with the provided public key and finally replacing the current application binary. To complete the update process, the application\u2019s service or appliance needs to be restarted. An attacker with administrator access can leverage the software update feature to force the application to download a custom binary that will replace current Pydio Cells binary. When the server or service is eventually restarted the attacker will be able to execute code under the privileges of the user running the application. In the Pydio Cells enterprise appliance this is with the privileges of the user named \u201cpydio\u201d.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12852", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nPydio\u00bbCells\u00bbVersion:2.0.4cpe:2.3:a:pydio:cells:2.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.48%  3.24%  +0.76 \n 2  2023-11-25  1.76%  2.48%  +0.72 \n 3  2023-10-23  1.25%  1.76%  +0.51 \n 4  2023-10-08  1.24%  1.25%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.88%  1.24%  +0.36 \n 6  2023-06-08  0.62%  0.88%  +0.26 \n 7  2023-05-24  0.48%  0.62%  +0.14 \n 8  2023-04-27  0.34%  0.48%  +0.14 \n 9  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.34%  -1.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158002/Pydio-Cells-2.0.4-XSS-File-Write-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Pydio Cells 2.0.4 XSS / File Write / Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cSlknElCEYDzD0W2CADuNtsTey8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.coresecurity.com/core-labs/advisories/pydio-cells-204-multiple-vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "Pydio Cells 2.0.4 Multiple Vulnerabilities | CoreLabs AdvisoriesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DP2q1t4g4zaSlnzaWhlRTjRgIU4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.coresecurity.com/advisories", "ref_desc": "Advisories | Core SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sS8XYkSJyzDgrWNGzaQsLo2fI3Y.html"}]}
