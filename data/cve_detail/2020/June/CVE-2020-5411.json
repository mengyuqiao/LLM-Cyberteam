{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5411", "Description": "When configured to enable default typing, Jackson contained a deserialization vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Jackson fixed this vulnerability by blacklisting known \"deserialization gadgets\". Spring Batch configures Jackson with global default typing enabled which means that through the previous exploit, arbitrary code could be executed if all of the following is true: * Spring Batch's Jackson support is being leveraged to serialize a job's ExecutionContext. * A malicious user gains write access to the data store used by the JobRepository (where the data to be deserialized is stored). In order to protect against this type of attack, Jackson prevents a set of untrusted gadget classes from being deserialized. Spring Batch should be proactive against blocking unknown \"deserialization gadgets\" when enabling default typing.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5411", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPivotal Software\u00bbSpring BatchVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.0.4cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:spring_batch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbSpring BatchVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.1.4cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:spring_batch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbSpring BatchVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.2.2cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:spring_batch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-06  0.29%  0.20%  -0.09 \n 2  2024-07-21  0.24%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-10-15  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-06-29  0.24%  0.17%  -0.07 \n 5  2023-05-18  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.23%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2020-5411", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-5411: Jackson Configuration Allows Code Execution with Unknown \u201cSerialization Gadgets\u201d | Security | VMware TanzuVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
