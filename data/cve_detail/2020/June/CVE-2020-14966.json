{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14966", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the jsrsasign package through 8.0.18 for Node.js. It allows a malleability in ECDSA signatures by not checking overflows in the length of a sequence and '0' characters appended or prepended to an integer. The modified signatures are verified as valid. This could have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single canonical signature.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14966", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetapp\u00bbMax Data\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:max_data:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJsrsasign Project\u00bbJsrsasign\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 8.0.18cpe:2.3:a:jsrsasign_project:jsrsasign:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.91%  0.63%  -0.28 \n 2  2024-10-16  0.92%  0.91%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-05-13  0.68%  0.92%  +0.24 \n 4  2023-11-10  0.78%  0.68%  -0.10 \n 5  2023-08-24  0.55%  0.78%  +0.23 \n 6  2023-05-29  0.39%  0.55%  +0.16 \n 7  2023-05-08  0.37%  0.39%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-08  0.33%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.33%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.18", "ref_desc": "Release RSA decryption and RSA signature validation maleability fix \u00b7 kjur/jsrsasign \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6o1rO7Wa-UUcAN1AX5muDFBad7M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign", "ref_desc": "jsrsasign - npmProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/916GJmNHA7HNTFPm9GAqLMVkQxo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.17", "ref_desc": "Release RSAPSS verification maleability fix and others \u00b7 kjur/jsrsasign \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bdYKBWQkAe_la_r3EiEp6EChAB0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200724-0001/", "ref_desc": "June 2020 Node.js Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/voRsq4ZUGLYuVSQy5PSRJot0vyE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/", "ref_desc": "jsrsasign - cryptography library in JavaScriptRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Y8drkhnzovwRPNhRbZPxmYn2sUI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/437", "ref_desc": "Lack of encoding checking in jsrsasign allows a certain degree of malleability in ECDSA signatures \u00b7 Issue #437 \u00b7 kjur/jsrsasign \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
