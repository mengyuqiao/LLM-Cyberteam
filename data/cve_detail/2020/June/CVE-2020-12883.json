{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12883", "Description": "Buffer over-reads were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses CoAP input linearly using a while loop. Once an option is parsed in a loop, the current point (*packet_data_pptr) is increased correspondingly. The pointer is restricted by the size of the received buffer, as well as by the option delta and option length bytes. The actual input packet length is not verified against the number of bytes read when processing the option extended delta and the option extended length. Moreover, the calculation of the message_left variable, in the case of non-extended option deltas, is incorrect and indicates more data left for processing than provided in the function input. All of these lead to heap-based or stack-based memory location read access that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. Depending on the platform-specific memory management mechanisms, it can lead to processing of unintended inputs or system memory access violation errors.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12883", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nARM\u00bbMbed Os\u00bbVersion:5.15.3cpe:2.3:o:arm:mbed_os:5.15.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.49%  0.56%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-04-22  0.35%  0.49%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-04-07  0.30%  0.35%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.30%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/pull/116", "ref_desc": "Bugfix/coap parser mem access bugs by mjurczak \u00b7 Pull Request #116 \u00b7 ARMmbed/mbed-coap \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B7ILbZKq1E0svdYFqazihHhhX2s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/12926", "ref_desc": "Out of range memory access in MbedOS CoAP library parser - option number \u00b7 Issue #12926 \u00b7 ARMmbed/mbed-os \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/12925", "ref_desc": "Out of range memory access in MbedOS CoAP library parser \u00b7 Issue #12925 \u00b7 ARMmbed/mbed-os \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/12927", "ref_desc": "Out of range memory access in MbedOS CoAP library parser - option value length \u00b7 Issue #12927 \u00b7 ARMmbed/mbed-os \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
