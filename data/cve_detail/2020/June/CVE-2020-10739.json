{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10739", "Description": "Istio 1.4.x before 1.4.9 and Istio 1.5.x before 1.5.4 contain the following vulnerability when telemetry v2 is enabled: by sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker could trigger a Null Pointer Exception resulting in a Denial of Service. This could be sent to the ingress gateway or a sidecar, triggering a null pointer exception which results in a denial of service. This also affects servicemesh-proxy where a null pointer exception flaw was found in servicemesh-proxy. When running Telemetry v2 (not on by default in version 1.4.x), an attacker could send a specially crafted packet to the ingress gateway or proxy sidecar, triggering a denial of service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10739", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.4.9cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 1.5.4cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.35%  0.25%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-04-06  0.36%  0.35%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-03-22  0.30%  0.36%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.30%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://istio.io/news/security/istio-security-2020-005/", "ref_desc": "Istio / ISTIO-SECURITY-2020-005Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-10739", "ref_desc": "1833184 \u2013 (CVE-2020-10739) CVE-2020-10739 istio/envoy: crafted packet allows remote attacker to cause denial of serviceBroken Link;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/envoy/commit/8788a3cf255b647fd14e6b5e2585abaaedb28153#diff-fcf2cf5dd389b5285f882ba4a8708633", "ref_desc": "1.4 - Do not call into the VM unless the VM Context has been created.\u2026 \u00b7 istio/envoy@8788a3c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
