{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3158", "Description": "A vulnerability in the High Availability (HA) service of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a sensitive part of the system with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability is due to a system account that has a default and static password and is not under the control of the system administrator. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this default account to connect to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain read and write access to system data, including the configuration of an affected device. The attacker would gain access to a sensitive portion of the system, but the attacker would not have full administrative rights to control the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3158", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSmart Software Manager On-premVersions  before (<) 7-202001cpe:2.3:a:cisco:smart_software_manager_on-prem:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-30  0.26%  0.37%  +0.11 \n 2  2023-11-06  0.37%  0.26%  -0.11 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.37%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-on-prem-static-cred-sL8rDs8", "ref_desc": "Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem Static Default Credential VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
