The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious data to a specific field within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Cisco ISE Software releases 2.7.0 and later contains the fix for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3149", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services EngineVersions  before (<) 2.7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xss-DxJsRWRx", "ref_desc": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
