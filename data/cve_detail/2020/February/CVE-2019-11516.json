{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11516", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Bluetooth component of the Cypress (formerly owned by Broadcom) Wireless IoT codebase. Extended Inquiry Responses (EIRs) are improperly handled, which causes a heap-based buffer overflow during device inquiry. This overflow can be used to overwrite existing functions with arbitrary code. The Reserved for Future Use (RFU) bits are not discarded by eir_handleRx(), and are included in an EIR's length. Therefore, one can exceed the expected 240 bytes, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in eir_getReceivedEIR() called by bthci_event_SendInquiryResultEvent(). In order to exploit this bug, an attacker must repeatedly connect to the victim's device in a short amount of time from different source addresses. This will cause the victim's Bluetooth stack to resolve the device names and therefore allocate buffers with attacker-controlled data. Due to the heap corruption, the name will be eventually written to an attacker-controlled location, leading to a write-what-where condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11516", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:google:android:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-12-10  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-11-25  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.20%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://community.cypress.com/thread/53681", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Cz2AwZErnKQfL-EltsOxkMnUP6w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-google-android-os-could-allow-for-arbitrary-code-execution_2019-078/", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities in Google Android OS Could Allow for Arbitrary Code ExecutionThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.techrepublic.com/article/android-security-bulletin-august-2019-what-you-need-to-know/", "ref_desc": "Android Security Bulletin August 2019: Critical vulnerabilities in Broadcom and Qualcomm components - TechRepublicThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2019-08-01", "ref_desc": "Android Security Bulletin\u2014August 2019 \u00a0|\u00a0 Android Open Source ProjectThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uNglCu1mOTVkgRb4NVeX5AhRds4.html"}]}
