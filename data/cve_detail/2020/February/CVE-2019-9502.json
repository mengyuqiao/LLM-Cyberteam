{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9502", "Description": "The Broadcom wl WiFi driver is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the vendor information element data length is larger than 164 bytes, a heap buffer overflow is triggered in wlc_wpa_plumb_gtk. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerability will result in denial-of-service conditions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9502", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nBroadcom\u00bbBcm4339 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:broadcom:bcm4339_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Broadcom\u00bbBcm4339\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSynology\u00bbRouter Manager\u00bbVersion:1.2cpe:2.3:a:synology:router_manager:1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  7.33%  +7.15 \n 2  2024-08-16  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-07-16  0.16%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-07-01  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-05-29  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-06  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.89%  0.12%  -1.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.quarkslab.com/reverse-engineering-broadcom-wireless-chipsets.html", "ref_desc": "Reverse-engineering Broadcom wireless chipsetsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/C_SFiQxKQPLjx8o18JewC9KT_ts.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/166939/", "ref_desc": "VU#166939 - Broadcom WiFi chipset drivers contain multiple vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SUEofOgJiPktxOG27JQbOCw3sAg.html"}]}
