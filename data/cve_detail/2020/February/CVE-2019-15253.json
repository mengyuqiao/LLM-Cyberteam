{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15253", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs administrator credentials. This vulnerability affects Cisco DNA Center Software releases earlier than 1.3.0.6 and 1.3.1.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15253", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbDna CenterVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.1.0andbefore (<) 1.3.1.4cpe:2.3:a:cisco:dna_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbDna CenterVersions  before (<) 1.3.0.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:dna_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.36%  +0.21 \n 2  2024-05-16  0.22%  0.15%  -0.06 \n 3  2024-04-01  0.15%  0.22%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.44%  0.15%  -2.28 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190205-dnac-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157668/Cisco-Digital-Network-Architecture-Center-1.3.1.4-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center 1.3.1.4 Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
