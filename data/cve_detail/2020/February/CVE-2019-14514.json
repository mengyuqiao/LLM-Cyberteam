{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14514", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Microvirt MEmu all versions prior to 7.0.2. A guest Android operating system inside the MEmu emulator contains a /system/bin/systemd binary that is run with root privileges on startup (this is unrelated to Red Hat's systemd init program, and is a closed-source proprietary tool that seems to be developed by Microvirt). This program opens TCP port 21509, presumably to receive installation-related commands from the host OS. Because everything after the installer:uninstall command is concatenated directly into a system() call, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands by supplying shell metacharacters.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14514", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMicrovirt\u00bbMemuVersions  before (<) 7.0.2cpe:2.3:a:microvirt:memu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.88% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.58%  7.88%  +7.30 \n 2  2024-01-17  0.46%  0.58%  +0.12 \n 3  2023-06-15  0.50%  0.46%  -0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  9.03%  0.50%  -8.53 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/seqred-s-a/cve-2019-14514", "ref_desc": "GitHub - seqred-s-a/cve-2019-14514: Remote code execution in Microvirt MEmuExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
