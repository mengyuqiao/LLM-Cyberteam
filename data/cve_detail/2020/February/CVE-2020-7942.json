{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7942", "Description": "Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificate was entitled to all information in the system and that a compromised certificate allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When a node's catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. This issue can be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet 6.13.0 and 5.5.19 changes the default behavior for strict_hostname_checking from false to true. It is recommended that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that are not upgrading still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure secure behavior. Affected software versions: Puppet 6.x prior to 6.13.0 Puppet Agent 6.x prior to 6.13.0 Puppet 5.5.x prior to 5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.x prior to 5.5.19 Resolved in: Puppet 6.13.0 Puppet Agent 6.13.0 Puppet 5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.19", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7942", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPuppet\u00bbPuppetVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.13.0cpe:2.3:a:puppet:puppet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPuppet\u00bbPuppetVersions  from including (>=) 5.5.0andbefore (<) 5.5.19cpe:2.3:a:puppet:puppet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPuppet\u00bbPuppet AgentVersions  from including (>=) 5.5.0andbefore (<) 5.5.19cpe:2.3:a:puppet:puppet_agent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPuppet\u00bbPuppet AgentVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.13.0cpe:2.3:a:puppet:puppet_agent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://puppet.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-7942/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-7942 - Arbitrary Catalog Retrieval in Puppet | Puppet.comVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
