{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8818", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the CardGate Payments plugin through 2.0.30 for Magento 2. Lack of origin authentication in the IPN callback processing function in Controller/Payment/Callback.php allows an attacker to remotely replace critical plugin settings (merchant ID, secret key, etc.) and therefore bypass the payment process (e.g., spoof an order status by manually sending an IPN callback request with a valid signature but without real payment) and/or receive all of the subsequent payments.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8818", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAdobe\u00bbMagento\u00bbVersion:2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:adobe:magento:2.3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCardgate\u00bbCardgate PaymentsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.30cpe:2.3:a:cardgate:cardgate_payments:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "11.82% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  8.39%  11.82%  +3.43 \n 2  2024-10-22  10.76%  8.39%  -2.37 \n 3  2024-02-09  22.86%  10.76%  -12.11 \n 4  2024-02-08  9.18%  22.86%  +13.69 \n 5  2023-11-11  9.28%  9.18%  -0.10 \n 6  2023-08-16  8.94%  9.28%  +0.34 \n 7  2023-07-14  6.54%  8.94%  +2.40 \n 8  2023-06-12  6.10%  6.54%  +0.44 \n 9  2023-04-27  4.40%  6.10%  +1.70 \n 10  2023-03-29  2.84%  4.40%  +1.56 \n 11  2023-03-07  9.23%  2.84%  -6.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cardgate/magento2/blob/715979e54e1a335d78a8c5586f9e9987c3bf94fd/Controller/Payment/Callback.php#L88-L107", "ref_desc": "magento2/Callback.php at 715979e54e1a335d78a8c5586f9e9987c3bf94fd \u00b7 cardgate/magento2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156505/Magento-WooCommerce-CardGate-Payment-Gateway-2.0.30-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "Magento WooCommerce CardGate Payment Gateway 2.0.30 Bypass \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cardgate/magento2/issues/54", "ref_desc": "Public disclosure on CVE-2020-8818 [Unauthorized Payments Hijacking + Order Status Spoofing] \u00b7 Issue #54 \u00b7 cardgate/magento2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
