{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18210", "Description": "Persistent XSS in /course/modedit.php of Moodle through 3.7.2 allows authenticated users (Teacher and above) to inject JavaScript into the session of another user (e.g., enrolled student or site administrator) via the introeditor[text] parameter. NOTE: the discoverer and vendor disagree on whether Moodle customers have a reasonable expectation that anyone authenticated as a Teacher can be trusted with the ability to add arbitrary JavaScript (this ability is not documented on Moodle's Teacher_role page). Because the vendor has this expectation, they have stated \"this report has been closed as a false positive, and not a bug.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18210", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMoodle\u00bbMoodleVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.7.2cpe:2.3:a:moodle:moodle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/Danbardo/4a6b0fe8cb21ec6d7c54e6ac951bdb0a", "ref_desc": "Moodle 3.7.2 and Prior Persistent XSS on Unit Pages \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Teacher_role", "ref_desc": "Teacher role - MoodleDocsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
