{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10790", "Description": "taffydb npm module, vulnerable in all versions up to and including 2.7.3, allows attackers to forge adding additional properties into user-input processed by taffy which can allow access to any data items in the DB. taffy sets an internal index for each data item in its DB. However, it is found that the internal index can be forged by adding additional properties into user-input. If index is found in the query, taffyDB will ignore other query conditions and directly return the indexed data item. Moreover, the internal index is in an easily-guessable format (e.g., T000002R000001). As such, attackers can use this vulnerability to access any data items in the DB.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10790", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTaffydb\u00bbTaffy\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:taffydb:taffy:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.72% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.54%  0.72%  +0.18 \n 2  2024-11-03  0.38%  0.54%  +0.16 \n 3  2024-01-24  0.30%  0.38%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-22  0.27%  0.29%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.28%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-18  0.31%  0.28%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.31%  -0.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TAFFY-546521", "ref_desc": "Internal Property Tampering in taffy | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TAFFYDB-2992450", "ref_desc": "Internal Property Tampering in taffydb | CVE-2019-10790 | Snyk", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
