{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19988", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Selesta Visual Access Manager (VAM) 4.15.0 through 4.29. A user with valid credentials is able to create and write XML files on the filesystem via /common/vam_editXml.php in the web interface. The vulnerable PHP page checks none of these: the parameter that identifies the file name to be created, the destination path, or the extension. Thus, an attacker can manipulate the file name to create any type of file within the filesystem with arbitrary content.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19988", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nSeling\u00bbVisual Access ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 4.15.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.29.0cpe:2.3:a:seling:visual_access_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.95% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.51%  0.95%  +0.44 \n 2  2023-07-01  0.48%  0.51%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.48%  -0.41 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/it/innovazione/cybersecurity/red-team.html", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability Research & Advisor | Gruppo TIMExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0rIwMQrp8fM4UySF1enUVZfgL-c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.seling.it/product/vam/", "ref_desc": "Applicativo Controllo Accessi: VAM - Selesta IngegneriaProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jl5I9_urGgdRavvYGe14rzRHQBE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.seling.it/", "ref_desc": "Controllo accessi, rilevazione presenze e Building Security - Selesta IngegneriaProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v5prHOiUPDXwksUxPSSZH7VtLyY.html"}]}
