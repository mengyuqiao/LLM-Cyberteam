{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8819", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the CardGate Payments plugin through 3.1.15 for WooCommerce. Lack of origin authentication in the IPN callback processing function in cardgate/cardgate.php allows an attacker to remotely replace critical plugin settings (merchant ID, secret key, etc.) and therefore bypass the payment process (e.g., spoof an order status by manually sending an IPN callback request with a valid signature but without real payment) and/or receive all of the subsequent payments.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8819", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCardgate\u00bbCardgate Payments\u00bbForWoocommerceVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.1.15cpe:2.3:a:cardgate:cardgate_payments:*:*:*:*:*:woocommerce:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "17.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  7.48%  17.29%  +9.82 \n 2  2024-12-15  6.79%  7.48%  +0.68 \n 3  2024-10-22  6.50%  6.79%  +0.29 \n 4  2024-06-20  6.72%  6.50%  -0.22 \n 5  2023-12-14  7.48%  6.72%  -0.76 \n 6  2023-11-11  7.57%  7.48%  -0.09 \n 7  2023-08-16  7.28%  7.57%  +0.28 \n 8  2023-07-14  5.29%  7.28%  +1.99 \n 9  2023-06-12  4.94%  5.29%  +0.36 \n 10  2023-05-13  5.56%  4.94%  -0.63 \n 11  2023-04-27  5.06%  5.56%  +0.50 \n 12  2023-03-29  3.28%  5.06%  +1.78 \n 13  2023-03-07  7.80%  3.28%  -4.53 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48134", "ref_desc": "WordPress Plugin WooCommerce CardGate Payment Gateway 3.1.15 - Payment Process Bypass - PHP webapps ExploitExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/10097", "ref_desc": "CardGate < 3.1.16 - Unauthorised Payments Hijacking and Order Status SpoofingThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cardgate/woocommerce/blob/f2111af7b1a3fd701c1c5916137f3ac09482feeb/cardgate/cardgate.php#L426-L442", "ref_desc": "woocommerce/cardgate.php at f2111af7b1a3fd701c1c5916137f3ac09482feeb \u00b7 cardgate/woocommerce \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156504/WordPress-WooCommerce-CardGate-Payment-Gateway-3.1.15-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "WordPress WooCommerce CardGate Payment Gateway 3.1.15 Bypass \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cardgate/woocommerce/issues/18", "ref_desc": "Public disclosure on CVE-2020-8819 [Unauthorized Payments Hijacking + Order Status Spoofing] \u00b7 Issue #18 \u00b7 cardgate/woocommerce \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
