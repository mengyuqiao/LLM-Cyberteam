{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-6754", "Description": "dotCMS before 5.2.4 is vulnerable to directory traversal, leading to incorrect access control. It allows an attacker to read or execute files under $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ROOT/assets (which should be a protected directory). Additionally, attackers can upload temporary files (e.g., .jsp files) into /webapps/ROOT/assets/tmp_upload, which can lead to remote command execution (with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6754", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDotcms\u00bbDotcmsVersions  before (<) 5.2.4cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.99% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  17.85%  2.99%  -14.86 \n 2  2024-03-16  14.83%  17.85%  +3.02 \n 3  2024-01-12  16.14%  14.83%  -1.32 \n 4  2023-10-05  16.16%  16.14%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-08-15  21.19%  16.16%  -5.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.98%  21.19%  +19.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://dotcms.com/security/SI-54", "ref_desc": "Incorrect access control can lead to information disclosure and remote execution | dotCMSExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/17796", "ref_desc": "File Upload \u00b7 Issue #17796 \u00b7 dotCMS/core \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ppHNtvmMoH3rmlRTLtN6T8uzJI4.html"}]}
