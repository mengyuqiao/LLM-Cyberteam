{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19992", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Selesta Visual Access Manager (VAM) 4.15.0 through 4.29. A user with valid credentials is able to read XML files on the filesystem via the web interface. The PHP page /common/vam_editXml.php doesn't check the parameter that identifies the file name to be read. Thus, an attacker can manipulate the file name to access a potentially sensitive file within the filesystem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19992", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSeling\u00bbVisual Access ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 4.15.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.29.0cpe:2.3:a:seling:visual_access_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-07-01  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/it/innovazione/cybersecurity/red-team.html", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability Research & Advisor | Gruppo TIMExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0rIwMQrp8fM4UySF1enUVZfgL-c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.seling.it/product/vam/", "ref_desc": "Applicativo Controllo Accessi: VAM - Selesta IngegneriaProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jl5I9_urGgdRavvYGe14rzRHQBE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.seling.it/", "ref_desc": "Controllo accessi, rilevazione presenze e Building Security - Selesta IngegneriaProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v5prHOiUPDXwksUxPSSZH7VtLyY.html"}]}
