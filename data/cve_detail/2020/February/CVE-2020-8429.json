{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8429", "Description": "The Admin web application in Kinetica 7.0.9.2.20191118151947 does not properly sanitise the input for the function getLogs. This lack of sanitisation could be exploited to allow an authenticated attacker to run remote code on the underlying operating system. The logFile parameter in the getLogs function was used as a variable in a command to read log files; however, due to poor input sanitisation, it was possible to bypass a replacement and break out of the command.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8429", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKinetica\u00bbKinetica\u00bbVersion:7.0.9.2.20191118151947cpe:2.3:a:kinetica:kinetica:7.0.9.2.20191118151947:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.89% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.89%  +0.66 \n 2  2024-09-26  0.33%  0.23%  -0.10 \n 3  2024-07-24  0.23%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-03-06  0.33%  0.23%  -0.10 \n 5  2023-09-08  0.33%  0.33%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.33%  -0.55 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.kinetica.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001223653-Release-Notes", "ref_desc": "Release Notes \u2013 KineticaRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/our-research/technical-advisory-command-injection/?research=Technical+advisories", "ref_desc": "Technical Advisory: Command InjectionExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
