{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12513", "Description": "In NETGEAR Nighthawk X10-R900 prior to 1.0.4.24, by sending a DHCP discover request containing a malicious hostname field, an attacker may execute stored XSS attacks against this device. When the malicious DHCP request is received, the device will generate a log entry containing the malicious hostname. This log entry may then be viewed at Advanced settings->Administration->Logs to trigger the exploit. Although this value is inserted into a textarea tag, converted to all-caps, and limited in length, attacks are still possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12513", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nNetgear\u00bbNighthawk X10-r9000 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.4.24cpe:2.3:o:netgear:nighthawk_x10-r9000_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Netgear\u00bbNighthawk X10-r9000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.19%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.ise.io/casestudies/sohopelessly-broken-2-0/", "ref_desc": "SOHOpelessly Broken 2.0 - Independent Security EvaluatorsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uXFXdelWRdCrSGCrV2hN4VZ6_ac.html"}]}
