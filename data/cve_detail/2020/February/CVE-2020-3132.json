{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3132", "Description": "A vulnerability in the email message scanning feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inadequate parsing mechanisms for specific email body components. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email containing a high number of shortened URLs through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume processing resources, causing a DoS condition on an affected device. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, certain conditions beyond the control of the attacker must occur.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3132", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security ApplianceVersions  before (<) 12.5.1-037cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security ApplianceVersions  before (<) 13.0.0-375cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCloud Email SecurityVersions  before (<) 12.5.1-037cpe:2.3:a:cisco:cloud_email_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCloud Email SecurityVersions  before (<) 13.0.0-375cpe:2.3:a:cisco:cloud_email_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-shrt-dos-wM54R8qA", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance Shortened URL Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
