{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18988", "Description": "TeamViewer Desktop through 14.7.1965 allows a bypass of remote-login access control because the same key is used for different customers' installations. It used a shared AES key for all installations since at least as far back as v7.0.43148, and used it for at least OptionsPasswordAES in the current version of the product. If an attacker were to know this key, they could decrypt protect information stored in the registry or configuration files of TeamViewer. With versions before v9.x , this allowed for attackers to decrypt the Unattended Access password to the system (which allows for remote login to the system as well as headless file browsing). The latest version still uses the same key for OptionPasswordAES but appears to have changed how the Unattended Access password is stored. While in most cases an attacker requires an existing session on a system, if the registry/configuration keys were stored off of the machine (such as in a file share or online), an attacker could then decrypt the required password to login to the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18988", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTeamviewer\u00bbTeamviewerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 14.7.1965cpe:2.3:a:teamviewer:teamviewer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.55%  +0.19 \n 2  2023-12-12  0.25%  0.36%  +0.11 \n 3  2023-07-13  0.18%  0.25%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-03-07  11.20%  0.18%  -11.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/Blurbdust/status/1224212682594770946?s=20", "ref_desc": "Nic Losby on Twitter: \"https://t.co/avUoHNCJ4G Teamviewer has been storing user passwords encrypted with AES, not hashed, in the registry accessible to low privilege users on the machine.
