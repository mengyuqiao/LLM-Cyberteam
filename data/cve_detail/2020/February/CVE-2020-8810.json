{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8810", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Gurux GXDLMS Director through 8.5.1905.1301. When downloading OBIS codes, it does not verify that the downloaded files are actual OBIS codes and doesn't check for path traversal. This allows the attacker exploiting CVE-2020-8809 to send executable files and place them in an autorun directory, or to place DLLs inside the existing GXDLMS Director installation (run on next execution of GXDLMS Director). This can be used to achieve code execution even if the user doesn't have any add-ins installed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8810", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGurux\u00bbDevice Language Message Specification DirectorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 8.5.1905.1301cpe:2.3:a:gurux:device_language_message_specification_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.27%  2.27%  +1.01 \n 2  2024-05-22  1.78%  1.27%  -0.52 \n 3  2024-02-01  2.51%  1.78%  -0.72 \n 4  2023-06-30  1.79%  2.51%  +0.72 \n 5  2023-03-07  19.46%  1.79%  -17.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seqred.pl/en/cve-gurux-gxdlms-director/", "ref_desc": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Gurux GXDLMS Director \u2013 remote code execution | SEQREDThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/c-hr6RJN-a7J9K00EEcTL0atEsw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/seqred-s-a/gxdlmsdirector-cve", "ref_desc": "GitHub - seqred-s-a/gxdlmsdirector-cve: CVE-2020-8809 and CVE-2020-8810Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/caJNf1mGL0HnCe2_d3ObFnWL7qs.html"}]}
