{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8809", "Description": "Gurux GXDLMS Director prior to 8.5.1905.1301 downloads updates to add-ins and OBIS code over an unencrypted HTTP connection. A man-in-the-middle attacker can prompt the user to download updates by modifying the contents of gurux.fi/obis/files.xml and gurux.fi/updates/updates.xml. Then, the attacker can modify the contents of downloaded files. In the case of add-ins (if the user is using those), this will lead to code execution. In case of OBIS codes (which the user is always using as they are needed to communicate with the energy meters), this can lead to code execution when combined with CVE-2020-8810.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8809", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGurux\u00bbDevice Language Message Specification DirectorVersions  before (<) 8.5.1905.1301cpe:2.3:a:gurux:device_language_message_specification_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.38%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-05-22  0.48%  0.34%  -0.14 \n 3  2024-04-05  0.41%  0.48%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-02-01  0.58%  0.41%  -0.17 \n 5  2023-11-12  0.48%  0.58%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-10-09  0.39%  0.48%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-06-30  0.23%  0.39%  +0.16 \n 8  2023-03-07  19.46%  0.23%  -19.23 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-494 Download of Code Without Integrity Check", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/494/Download-of-Code-Without-Integrity-Check.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seqred.pl/en/cve-gurux-gxdlms-director/", "ref_desc": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Gurux GXDLMS Director \u2013 remote code execution | SEQREDExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/c-hr6RJN-a7J9K00EEcTL0atEsw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/seqred-s-a/gxdlmsdirector-cve", "ref_desc": "GitHub - seqred-s-a/gxdlmsdirector-cve: CVE-2020-8809 and CVE-2020-8810Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/caJNf1mGL0HnCe2_d3ObFnWL7qs.html"}]}
