{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8843", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Istio 1.3 through 1.3.6. Under certain circumstances, it is possible to bypass a specifically configured Mixer policy. Istio-proxy accepts the x-istio-attributes header at ingress that can be used to affect policy decisions when Mixer policy selectively applies to a source equal to ingress. To exploit this vulnerability, someone has to encode a source.uid in this header. This feature is disabled by default in Istio 1.3 and 1.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8843", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.3.6cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.35%  0.19%  -0.16 \n 2  2023-12-19  0.25%  0.35%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-12-04  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.21%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/istio/commits/master", "ref_desc": "Commits \u00b7 istio/istio \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fkrgDgif9eR9ooxIBDmQLI69ZmU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://istio.io/news/security/istio-security-2020-002/", "ref_desc": "Istio / ISTIO-SECURITY-2020-002Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://istio.io/news/security/", "ref_desc": "Istio / Security BulletinsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SeaeS40LRb6x_3g-0cj3zkRqj-4.html"}]}
