{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17061", "Description": "The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack implementation on Cypress PSoC 4 through 3.62 devices does not properly restrict the BLE Link Layer header and executes certain memory contents upon receiving a packet with a Link Layer ID (LLID) equal to zero. This allows attackers within radio range to cause deadlocks, cause anomalous behavior in the BLE state machine, or trigger a buffer overflow via a crafted BLE Link Layer frame.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17061", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nCypress\u00bbPsoc 4 BleVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.62cpe:2.3:a:cypress:psoc_4_ble:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cypress\u00bbPsoc 4\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-15  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-11-30  0.08%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://community.cypress.com/thread/53680", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iTzdZA_q1vrhZj0qIcurmiK1UVY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cypress.com/products/ble-bluetooth", "ref_desc": "BLE & BluetoothVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/", "ref_desc": "ASSET Research Group: SweynToothThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vBuJIzkJxMxRc1tum7_0USOaEQk.html"}]}
