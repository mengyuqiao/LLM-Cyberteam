{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8989", "Description": "In the Voatz application 2020-01-01 for Android, the amount of data transmitted during a single voter's vote depends on the different lengths of the metadata across the available voting choices, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover this voter's choice by sniffing the network. For example, a small amount of sniffed data may indicate that a vote was cast for the candidate with the least metadata. An active man-in-the-middle attacker can leverage this behavior to disrupt voters' abilities to vote for a candidate opposed by the attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8989", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVoatz\u00bbVoatz\u00bbVersion:2020-01-01ForAndroidcpe:2.3:a:voatz:voatz:2020-01-01:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.voatz.com/?p=1209", "ref_desc": "Voatz Response to Researchers\u2019 Flawed Report - Blog @ VoatzVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9LFsSLTz-AIVhdRFepuKwA64xbU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SecurityAnalysisOfVoatz_Public.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/P9_DvdyxFPa9UdYaX0POsRf6XIk.html"}]}
