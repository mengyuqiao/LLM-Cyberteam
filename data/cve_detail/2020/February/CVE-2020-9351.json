{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-9351", "Description": "An issue was discovered in SmartClient 12.0. If an unauthenticated attacker makes a POST request to /tools/developerConsoleOperations.jsp or /isomorphic/IDACall with malformed XML data in the _transaction parameter, the server replies with a verbose error showing where the application resides (the absolute path). NOTE: the documentation states \"These tools are, by default, available to anyone ... so they should only be deployed into a trusted environment. Alternately, the tools can easily be restricted to administrators or end users by protecting the tools path with normal authentication and authorization mechanisms on the web server.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9351", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSmartclient\u00bbSmartclient\u00bbVersion:12.0cpe:2.3:a:smartclient:smartclient:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.19%  0.15%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Feb/18", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Multiple vulnerabilities in SmartClient_v12Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1AJJo__-kpNi5_llURNWd0vRFm4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www-demos.smartclient.com/smartclient-12.0/isomorphic/system/reference/?id=group..toolsDeployment", "ref_desc": "SmartClient\u2122 Reference v12.0p_2024-03-16 (2024-03-16)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/apFvoO-NdqhR1zNnjYJW64isDB4.html"}]}
