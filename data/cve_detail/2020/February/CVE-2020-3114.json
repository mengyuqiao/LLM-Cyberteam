The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link while having an active session on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the targeted user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3114", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbData Center Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 11.3\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:data_center_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-30  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-11-06  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200219-dcnm-csrf", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
