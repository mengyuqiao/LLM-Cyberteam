{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8658", "Description": "The BestWebSoft Htaccess plugin through 1.8.1 for WordPress allows wp-admin/admin.php?page=htaccess.php&action=htaccess_editor CSRF. The flag htccss_nonce_name passes the nonce to WordPress but the plugin does not validate it correctly, resulting in a wrong implementation of anti-CSRF protection. In this way, an attacker is able to direct the victim to a malicious web page that modifies the .htaccess file, and takes control of the website.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8658", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nBestwebsoft\u00bbHtaccess\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.8.1cpe:2.3:a:bestwebsoft:htaccess:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.90% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.90%  +0.56 \n 2  2023-06-10  0.28%  0.34%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.28%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/10060", "ref_desc": "Htaccess by BestWebSoft <= 1.8.1 - CSRF to edit .htaccessThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/htaccess/#developers", "ref_desc": "Htaccess by BestWebSoft \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.orgThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OVhxh7bkx3GRw1ZoyOY-YSIgHJ8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/V1n1v131r4/Exploiting-WP-Htaccess-by-BestWebSoft-Plugin/blob/master/README.md", "ref_desc": "Exploiting-WP-Htaccess-by-BestWebSoft-Plugin/README.md at master \u00b7 V1n1v131r4/Exploiting-WP-Htaccess-by-BestWebSoft-Plugin \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
