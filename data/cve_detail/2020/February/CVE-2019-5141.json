{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5141", "Description": "An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the iw_webs functionality of the Moxa AWK-3131A firmware version 1.13. A specially crafted iw_serverip parameter can cause user input to be reflected in a subsequent iw_system call, resulting in remote control over the device. An attacker can send commands while authenticated as a low privilege user to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5141", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMoxa\u00bbAwk-3131a Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.13cpe:2.3:o:moxa:awk-3131a_firmware:1.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Moxa\u00bbAwk-3131a\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "2.70% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.00%  2.70%  +1.70 \n 2  2024-10-10  1.41%  1.00%  -0.41 \n 3  2024-08-07  1.00%  1.41%  +0.41 \n 4  2024-03-20  1.41%  1.00%  -0.41 \n 5  2024-02-18  2.04%  1.41%  -0.63 \n 6  2024-02-01  1.54%  2.04%  +0.50 \n 7  2023-12-30  1.27%  1.54%  +0.27 \n 8  2023-11-12  1.56%  1.27%  -0.29 \n 9  2023-10-25  1.37%  1.56%  +0.19 \n 10  2023-09-04  1.29%  1.37%  +0.08 \n 11  2023-07-31  1.21%  1.29%  +0.08 \n 12  2023-06-30  1.34%  1.21%  -0.12 \n 13  2023-03-14  0.95%  1.34%  +0.39 \n 14  2023-03-07  2.06%  0.95%  -1.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2019-0930", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2019-0930 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
