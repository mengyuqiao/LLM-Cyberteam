{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13941", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in OZW672 (All versions < V10.00), OZW772 (All versions < V10.00). Vulnerable versions of OZW Web Server use predictable path names for project files that legitimately authenticated users have created by using the application's export function. By accessing a specific uniform resource locator on the web server, a remote attacker could be able to download a project file without prior authentication. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected system. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability compromises the confidentiality of the targeted system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13941", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbOzw672 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 10.00cpe:2.3:o:siemens:ozw672_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbOzw672\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSiemens\u00bbOzw772 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 10.00cpe:2.3:o:siemens:ozw772_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbOzw772\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.37%  0.50%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-03-22  0.28%  0.37%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-10-29  0.29%  0.28%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.29%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-986695.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-042-09", "ref_desc": "Siemens OZW Web Server | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
