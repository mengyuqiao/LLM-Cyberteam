{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3139", "Description": "A vulnerability in the out of band (OOB) management interface IP table rule programming for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured deny entries for specific IP ports. These IP ports would be permitted to the OOB management interface when, in fact, the packets should be dropped. The vulnerability is due to the configuration of specific IP table entries for which there is a programming logic error that results in the IP port being permitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic to the OOB management interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured IP table rules to drop specific IP port traffic. The attacker has no control over the configuration of the device itself. This vulnerability affects Cisco APIC releases prior to the first fixed software Release 4.2(3j).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3139", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbApplication Policy Infrastructure ControllerVersions  before (<) 4.2\\(3j\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_policy_infrastructure_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iptable-bypass-GxW88XjL", "ref_desc": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Out Of Band Management IP Tables Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
