The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web-based management interface with administrative privileges and supplying crafted requests to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system with root privileges on a targeted node.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16005", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbCollaboration Meeting Rooms\u00bbVersion:2.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:collaboration_meeting_rooms:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Video MeshVersions  before (<) 2019.09.19.1956mcpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_video_mesh:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-28  0.15%  0.15%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200108-webex-video", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Video Mesh Node Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
