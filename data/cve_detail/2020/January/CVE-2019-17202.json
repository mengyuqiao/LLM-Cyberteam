{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17202", "Description": "FastTrack Admin By Request 6.1.0.0 supports group policies that are supposed to allow only a select range of users to elevate to Administrator privilege at will. If a user does not have direct access to the elevation feature through group policies, they are prompted to enter a PIN code in a challenge-response manner upon attempting to elevate privileges. The challenge's response uses a simple algorithm that can be easily emulated via data (customer ID and device name) available to all users, and thus any user can elevate to Administrator privilege.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17202", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFasttracksoftware\u00bbAdmin By RequestVersions  before (<) 6.2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:fasttracksoftware:admin_by_request:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.adminbyrequest.com/en/releasenotes", "ref_desc": "Release Notes \u00bb Admin By RequestCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6TQX2azg4guC9cauptrfZ-B6re0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://improsec.com/en/responsible-disclosure", "ref_desc": "Responsible Disclosure \u2014 Improsec | improving securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uQ4vcP9N2jk31md8sjtj8igeIvw.html"}]}
