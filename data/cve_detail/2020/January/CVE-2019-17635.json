{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17635", "Description": "Eclipse Memory Analyzer version 1.9.1 and earlier is subject to a deserialization vulnerability if an index file of a parsed heap dump is replaced by a malicious version and the heap dump is reopened in Memory Analyzer. The user must chose to reopen an already parsed heap dump with an untrusted index for the problem to occur. The problem can be averted if the index files from an untrusted source are deleted and the heap dump is opened and reparsed. Also some local configuration data is subject to a deserialization vulnerability if the local data were to be replaced with a malicious version. This can be averted if the local configuration data stored on the file system cannot be changed by an attacker. The vulnerability could possibly allow code execution on the local system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17635", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbMemory AnalyzerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.9.1cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:memory_analyzer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.32%  +0.23 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.09%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=558633", "ref_desc": "558633 \u2013 (CVE-2019-17635) Deserialization issuesExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
