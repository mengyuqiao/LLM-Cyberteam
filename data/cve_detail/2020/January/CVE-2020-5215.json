{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5215", "Description": "In TensorFlow before 1.15.2 and 2.0.1, converting a string (from Python) to a tf.float16 value results in a segmentation fault in eager mode as the format checks for this use case are only in the graph mode. This issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training where a malicious attacker can send a data point which contains a string instead of a tf.float16 value. Similar effects can be obtained by manipulating saved models and checkpoints whereby replacing a scalar tf.float16 value with a scalar string will trigger this issue due to automatic conversions. This can be easily reproduced by tf.constant(\"hello\", tf.float16), if eager execution is enabled. This issue is patched in TensorFlow 1.15.1 and 2.0.1 with this vulnerability patched. TensorFlow 2.1.0 was released after we fixed the issue, thus it is not affected. Users are encouraged to switch to TensorFlow 1.15.1, 2.0.1 or 2.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5215", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 1.15.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-19  0.49%  0.55%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.49%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-06-10  0.26%  0.36%  +0.11 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.40%  0.26%  -2.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.15.2", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 1.15.2 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-977j-xj7q-2jr9", "ref_desc": "Segmentation fault when converting a Python string to `tf.float16` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.0.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5ac1b9e24ff6afc465756edf845d2e9660bd34bf", "ref_desc": "Fix segfault when attempting to convert string to float16. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@5ac1b9e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
