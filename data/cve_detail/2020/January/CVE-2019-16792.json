{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16792", "Description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16792", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOracle\u00bbCommunications Cloud Native Core Network Function Cloud Native Environment\u00bbVersion:1.10.0cpe:2.3:a:oracle:communications_cloud_native_core_network_function_cloud_native_environment:1.10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAgendaless\u00bbWaitressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.1cpe:2.3:a:agendaless:waitress:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.15%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-05-17  0.27%  0.19%  -0.08 \n 3  2023-11-26  0.28%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-11-11  0.24%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.24%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4ppp-gpcr-7qf6", "ref_desc": "HTTP Request Smuggling: Content-Length Sent Twice \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Pylons/waitress \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/575994cd42e83fd772a5f7ec98b2c56751bd3f65", "ref_desc": "Upon receiving invalid Content-Length bail \u00b7 Pylons/waitress@575994c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6asgpQiuGkU8TMiXi_ZmgQDbjR8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/#security-fixes", "ref_desc": "Waitress \u2014 waitress 1.4.2 documentationRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7AAdfPVgP_3Bi1iyKDHxCC1cWOg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00011.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3000-1] waitress security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fQqsZsydeoGuR8NXB0BRskZhWEI.html"}]}
