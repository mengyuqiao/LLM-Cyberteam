{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18625", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata 5.0.0. It was possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by faking a closed TCP session using an evil server. After the TCP SYN packet, it is possible to inject a RST ACK and a FIN ACK packet with a bad TCP Timestamp option. The client will ignore the RST ACK and the FIN ACK packets because of the bad TCP Timestamp option. Both linux and windows client are ignoring the injected packets.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18625", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOisf\u00bbSuricata\u00bbVersion:5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:oisf:suricata:5.0.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.14%  -0.06 \n 2  2023-11-10  0.21%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-10-26  0.18%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.16%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.16%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/9f0294fadca3dcc18c919424242a41e01f3e8318", "ref_desc": "stream: fix SYN_SENT RST/FIN injection \u00b7 OISF/suricata@9f0294f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/01/msg00032.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2087-1] suricata security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/90Avpdx6CdrpviPlvltUyxVcmn8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/3395", "ref_desc": "Bug #3395: TCP evasion technique by faking a closed TCP session (4.1.x) - Suricata - Open Information Security FoundationThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/ea0659de7640cf6a51de5bbd1dbbb0414e4623a0", "ref_desc": "stream: fix SYN_SENT RST/FIN injection \u00b7 OISF/suricata@ea0659d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/3286", "ref_desc": "Bug #3286: TCP evasion technique by faking a closed TCP session - Suricata - Open Information Security FoundationThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
