{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7934", "Description": "In LifeRay Portal CE 7.1.0 through 7.2.1 GA2, the First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name fields for user accounts in MyAccountPortlet are all vulnerable to a persistent XSS issue. Any user can modify these fields with a particular XSS payload, and it will be stored in the database. The payload will then be rendered when a user utilizes the search feature to search for other users (i.e., if a user with modified fields occurs in the search results).
