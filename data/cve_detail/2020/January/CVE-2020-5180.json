{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5180", "Description": "Viscosity 1.8.2 on Windows and macOS allows an unprivileged user to set a subset of OpenVPN parameters, which can be used to load a malicious library into the memory of the OpenVPN process, leading to limited local privilege escalation. (When a VPN connection is initiated using a TLS/SSL client profile, the privileges are dropped, and the library will be loaded, resulting in arbitrary code execution as a user with limited privileges. This greatly reduces the impact of the vulnerability.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5180", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSparklabs\u00bbViscosity\u00bbVersion:1.8.2cpe:2.3:a:sparklabs:viscosity:1.8.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.sparklabs.com/blog/viscosity-for-mac-windows-version-1-8-4/", "ref_desc": "Viscosity For Mac & Windows: Version 1.8.4 - SparkLabsRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
