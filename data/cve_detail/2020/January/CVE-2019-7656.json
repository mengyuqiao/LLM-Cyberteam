{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7656", "Description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.0 and earlier allows any unprivileged Linux user to escalate privileges to root. The installer sets too relaxed permissions on /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/* core program files. By injecting a payload into one of those files, it will run with the same privileges as the Wowza server, root. For example, /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/bin/tune.sh could be replaced with a Trojan horse. This issue was resolved in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7656", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nWowza\u00bbStreaming EngineVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.8.0cpe:2.3:a:wowza:streaming_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wowza.com/pricing/installer", "ref_desc": "Streaming Server Download | Wowza Media SystemsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GKlmcsPPD3J5AiPcqdm9_8ujOew.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wowza.com/docs/wowza-streaming-engine-4-8-5-release-notes", "ref_desc": "Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/I5DMnQEebmODtwI1PHvYtwJPtCk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WowzaMediaSystems/public_cve/main/wowza-streaming-engine/CVE-2019-7656.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-7656-PrivEscal-Wowza", "ref_desc": "Disclosures/CVE-2019-7656-PrivEscal-Wowza at master \u00b7 DrunkenShells/Disclosures \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
