{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16784", "Description": "In PyInstaller before version 3.6, only on Windows, a local privilege escalation vulnerability is present in this particular case: If a software using PyInstaller in \"onefile\" mode is launched by a privileged user (at least more than the current one) which have his \"TempPath\" resolving to a world writable directory. This is the case for example if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system account (TempPath will be C:\\Windows\\Temp). In order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started after the attacker launch the exploit program, so for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16784", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPyinstaller\u00bbPyinstallerVersions  before (<) 3.6cpe:2.3:a:pyinstaller:pyinstaller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-250 Execution with Unnecessary Privileges", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/250/Execution-with-Unnecessary-Privileges.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/security/advisories/GHSA-7fcj-pq9j-wh2r", "ref_desc": "Local Privilege Escalation caused by insecure directory permissions of sys._MEIPATH \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pyinstaller/pyinstaller \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
