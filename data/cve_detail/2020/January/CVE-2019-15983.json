{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15983", "Description": "A vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read access to information that is stored on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative privileges on the DCNM application. The vulnerability exists because the SOAP API improperly handles XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious XML content in an API request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the affected device. Note: The severity of this vulnerability is aggravated by the vulnerabilities described in the Cisco Data Center Network Manager Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities advisory, published simultaneously with this one.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15983", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbData Center Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 11.3\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:data_center_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.44%  0.39%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-12-15  0.51%  0.44%  -0.07 \n 3  2024-11-27  0.33%  0.51%  +0.18 \n 4  2024-08-29  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-08-17  0.38%  0.30%  -0.08 \n 6  2024-07-15  0.30%  0.38%  +0.08 \n 7  2024-05-15  0.28%  0.30%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-04-24  0.24%  0.28%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.24%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200102-dcnm-xml-ext-entity", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager XML External Entity Read Access VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
