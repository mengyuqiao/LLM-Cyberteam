{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9500", "Description": "The Broadcom brcmfmac WiFi driver prior to commit 1b5e2423164b3670e8bc9174e4762d297990deff is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the Wake-up on Wireless LAN functionality is configured, a malicious event frame can be constructed to trigger an heap buffer overflow in the brcmf_wowl_nd_results function. This vulnerability can be exploited with compromised chipsets to compromise the host, or when used in combination with CVE-2019-9503, can be used remotely. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerability will result in denial-of-service conditions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9500", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 4.5andbefore (<) 4.9.181cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 4.10andbefore (<) 4.14.123cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 4.15andbefore (<) 4.19.47cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 4.20andbefore (<) 5.0.20cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBroadcom\u00bbBrcmfmac Driver\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:broadcom:brcmfmac_driver:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.68%  0.60%  -0.09 \n 2  2023-05-21  0.57%  0.68%  +0.12 \n 3  2023-03-19  0.53%  0.57%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  5.63%  0.53%  -5.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.quarkslab.com/reverse-engineering-broadcom-wireless-chipsets.html", "ref_desc": "Reverse-engineering Broadcom wireless chipsetsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/C_SFiQxKQPLjx8o18JewC9KT_ts.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/166939/", "ref_desc": "VU#166939 - Broadcom WiFi chipset drivers contain multiple vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SUEofOgJiPktxOG27JQbOCw3sAg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/linus/1b5e2423164b3670e8bc9174e4762d297990deff", "ref_desc": "kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - Linux kernel source treePatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
