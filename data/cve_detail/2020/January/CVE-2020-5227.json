{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5227", "Description": "Feedgen (python feedgen) before 0.9.0 is susceptible to XML Denial of Service attacks. The *feedgen* library allows supplying XML as content for some of the available fields. This XML will be parsed and integrated into the existing XML tree. During this process, feedgen is vulnerable to XML Denial of Service Attacks (e.g. XML Bomb). This becomes a concern in particular if feedgen is used to include content from untrused sources and if XML (including XHTML) is directly included instead of providing plain tex content only. This problem has been fixed in feedgen 0.9.0 which disallows XML entity expansion and external resources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5227", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFeedgen Project\u00bbFeedgen\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 0.9.0cpe:2.3:a:feedgen_project:feedgen:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.25%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.28%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-776 Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/776/Improper-Restriction-of-Recursive-Entity-References-in-DTDs-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2009/november/xml-denial-of-service-attacks-and-defenses", "ref_desc": "XML Denial of Service Attacks and Defenses | Microsoft DocsExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen/commit/f57a01b20fa4aaaeccfa417f28e66b4084b9d0cf", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-g8q7-xv52-hf9f \u00b7 lkiesow/python-feedgen@f57a01b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T6I5ENUYGFNMIH6ZQ62FZ6VU2WD3SIOI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: python-feedgen-0.9.0-1.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen/security/advisories/GHSA-g8q7-xv52-hf9f", "ref_desc": "Feedgen Vulnerable Against XML Denial of Service Attacks \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 lkiesow/python-feedgen \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
