{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5206", "Description": "In Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1, using a remember-me cookie with an arbitrary username can cause Opencast to assume proper authentication for that user even if the remember-me cookie was incorrect given that the attacked endpoint also allows anonymous access. This way, an attacker can, for example, fake a remember-me token, assume the identity of the global system administrator and request non-public content from the search service without ever providing any proper authentication. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5206", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApereo\u00bbOpencastVersions  before (<) 7.6cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApereo\u00bbOpencast\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.14%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-vmm6-w4cf-7f3x", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass For Endpoints With Anonymous Access \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencast/opencast \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/b157e1fb3b35991ca7bf59f0730329fbe7ce82e8", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass For Endpoints With Anonymous Access \u00b7 opencast/opencast@b157e1f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
