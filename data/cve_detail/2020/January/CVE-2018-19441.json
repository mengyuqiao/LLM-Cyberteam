{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-19441", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Neato Botvac Connected 2.2.0. The GenerateRobotPassword function of the NeatoCrypto library generates insufficiently random numbers for robot secret_key values used for local and cloud authentication/authorization. If an attacker knows the serial number and is able to estimate the time of first provisioning of a robot, he is able to brute force the generated secret_key of the robot. This is because the entropy of the secret_key exclusively relies on these two values, due to not seeding the random generator and using several constant inputs for secret_key computation. Serial numbers are printed on the packaging and equal the MAC address of the robot.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19441", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNeatorobotics\u00bbBotvac Connected Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.2.0cpe:2.3:o:neatorobotics:botvac_connected_firmware:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Neatorobotics\u00bbBotvac Connected\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_ullrich.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mFkbdmA9JQGZaQERQrJTmFBXzew.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5nj7Jhwn9c", "ref_desc": "Jiska - Vacuum Cleaning Security Pinky and The Brain Edition - DEF CON 27 Conference - YouTubeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
