{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5231", "Description": "In Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1, users with the role ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN can use the user-utils endpoint to create new users not including the role ROLE_ADMIN. ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN is a non-standard role in Opencast which is referenced neither in the documentation nor in any code (except for tests) but only in the security configuration. From the name \u2013 implying an admin for a specific course \u2013 users would never expect that this role allows user creation. This issue is fixed in 7.6 and 8.1 which both ship a new default security configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5231", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApereo\u00bbOpencastVersions  before (<) 7.6cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApereo\u00bbOpencast\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-94qw-r73x-j7hg", "ref_desc": "Users with ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN can create new users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencast/opencast \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/72fad0031d8a82c860e2bde0b27570c5042320ee", "ref_desc": "Remove ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN \u00b7 opencast/opencast@72fad00 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
