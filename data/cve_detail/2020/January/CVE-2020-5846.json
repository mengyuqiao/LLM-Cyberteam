{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5846", "Description": "An insecure file upload and code execution issue was discovered in Ahsay Cloud Backup Suite 8.3.0.30 via a \"PUT /obs/obm7/file/upload\" request with the base64-encoded pathname in the X-RSW-custom-encode-path HTTP header, and the content in the HTTP request body. It is possible to upload a file into any directory of the server. One can insert a JSP shell into the web server's directory and execute it. This leads to full system access as the configured user (e.g., Administrator) when starting from any authenticated session (e.g., a trial account). This is fixed in the 83/830122/cbs-*-hotfix-task26000 builds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5846", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAhsay\u00bbCloud Backup Suite\u00bbVersion:8.3.0.30cpe:2.3:a:ahsay:cloud_backup_suite:8.3.0.30:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-05-11  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.34%  0.10%  -1.24 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wbsec.nl/ahsay-2/", "ref_desc": "AhSay Cloud backup - multiple vulnerabilitiesExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
