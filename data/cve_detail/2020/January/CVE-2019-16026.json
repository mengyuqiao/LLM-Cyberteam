{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16026", "Description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on Cisco Mobility Management Entity (MME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an eNodeB that is connected to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of SCTP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a man-in-the-middle position between the eNodeB and the MME and then sending a crafted SCTP message to the MME. A successful exploit would cause the MME to stop sending SCTP messages to the eNodeB, triggering a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16026", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbStarosVersions  before (<) 21.16.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:staros:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 5000\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 5500\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 5700\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200108-mme-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Mobility Management Entity Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
