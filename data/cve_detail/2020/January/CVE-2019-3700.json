{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3700", "Description": "yast2-security didn't use secure defaults to protect passwords. This became a problem on 2019-10-07 when configuration files that set secure settings were moved to a different location. As of the 20191022 snapshot the insecure default settings were used until yast2-security switched to stronger defaults in 4.2.6 and used the new configuration file locations. Password created during this time used DES password encryption and are not properly protected against attackers that are able to access the password hashes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3700", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSuse\u00bbYast2-securityVersions  before (<) 4.2.6cpe:2.3:a:suse:yast2-security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1157541", "ref_desc": "Bug 1157541 \u2013 VUL-0: CVE-2019-3700: yast: Fallback to DES without configuration in /etc/login.defIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
