{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5222", "Description": "Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1 enables a remember-me cookie based on a hash created from the username, password, and an additional system key. This means that an attacker getting access to a remember-me token for one server can get access to all servers which allow log-in using the same credentials without ever needing the credentials. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5222", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApereo\u00bbOpencastVersions  before (<) 7.6cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApereo\u00bbOpencast\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-mh8g-hprg-8363", "ref_desc": "Hard-Coded Key Used For Remember-me Token \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencast/opencast \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/1a7172c95af8d542a77ae5b153e4c834dd4788a6", "ref_desc": "Fix Remember-Me Cookie \u00b7 opencast/opencast@1a7172c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
