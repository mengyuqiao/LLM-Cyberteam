{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5230", "Description": "Opencast before 8.1 and 7.6 allows almost arbitrary identifiers for media packages and elements to be used. This can be problematic for operation and security since such identifiers are sometimes used for file system operations which may lead to an attacker being able to escape working directories and write files to other locations. In addition, Opencast's Id.toString(\u2026) vs Id.compact(\u2026) behavior, the latter trying to mitigate some of the file system problems, can cause errors due to identifier mismatch since an identifier may unintentionally change. This issue is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and 8.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5230", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApereo\u00bbOpencastVersions  before (<) 7.6cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApereo\u00bbOpencast\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-99 Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/99/Improper-Control-of-Resource-Identifiers-Resource-Injectio.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/bbb473f34ab95497d6c432c81285efb0c739f317", "ref_desc": "Limit Characters Allowed In Ids \u00b7 opencast/opencast@bbb473f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-w29m-fjp4-qhmq", "ref_desc": "Unsafe Identifiers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencast/opencast \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
