{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17201", "Description": "FastTrack Admin By Request 6.1.0.0 supports group policies that are supposed to allow only a select range of users to elevate to Administrator privilege at will. When a user requests elevation using the AdminByRequest.exe interface, the interface communicates with the underlying service (Audckq32.exe) using a .NET named pipe. If the underlying service responds that a user is permitted access to the elevation feature, the client then reinitiates communication with the underlying service and requests elevation. This elevation request has no local checks in the service, and depends on client-side validation in the AdminByRequest.exe interface, i.e., it is a vulnerable exposed functionality in the service. By communicating directly with the underlying service, any user can request elevation and obtain Administrator privilege regardless of group policies or permissions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17201", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFasttracksoftware\u00bbAdmin By RequestVersions  before (<) 6.2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:fasttracksoftware:admin_by_request:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.adminbyrequest.com/en/releasenotes", "ref_desc": "Release Notes \u00bb Admin By RequestCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6TQX2azg4guC9cauptrfZ-B6re0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://improsec.com/en/responsible-disclosure", "ref_desc": "Responsible Disclosure \u2014 Improsec | improving securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uQ4vcP9N2jk31md8sjtj8igeIvw.html"}]}
