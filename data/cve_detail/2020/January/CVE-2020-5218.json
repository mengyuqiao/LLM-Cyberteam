{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5218", "Description": "Affected versions of Sylius give attackers the ability to switch channels via the _channel_code GET parameter in production environments. This was meant to be enabled only when kernel.debug is set to true. However, if no sylius_channel.debug is set explicitly in the configuration, the default value which is kernel.debug will be not resolved and cast to boolean, enabling this debug feature even if that parameter is set to false. Patch has been provided for Sylius 1.3.x and newer - 1.3.16, 1.4.12, 1.5.9, 1.6.5. Versions older than 1.3 are not covered by our security support anymore.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5218", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.4.6cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0andbefore (<) 1.3.13cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.6.0andbefore (<) 1.6.3cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSylius\u00bbVersion:1.5.0cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:1.5.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusResourceBundle/security/advisories/GHSA-8vp7-j5cj-vvm2", "ref_desc": "Ability to define unintended serialisation groups via HTTP header which might lead to data exposure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sylius/SyliusResourceBundle \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JLQviabNc1utLVmMyB-oJFafnEU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/sylius/resource-bundle/CVE-2020-5220.yaml", "ref_desc": "security-advisories/CVE-2020-5220.yaml at master \u00b7 FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QaaEAHhPSf1Lz7d40ogYd8QiHFA.html"}]}
