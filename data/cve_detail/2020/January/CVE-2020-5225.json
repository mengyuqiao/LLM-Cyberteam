{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5225", "Description": "Log injection in SimpleSAMLphp before version 1.18.4. The www/erroreport.php script, which receives error reports and sends them via email to the system administrator, did not properly sanitize the report identifier obtained from the request. This allows an attacker, under specific circumstances, to inject new log lines by manually crafting this report ID. When configured to use the file logging handler, SimpleSAMLphp will output all its logs by appending each log line to a given file. Since the reportID parameter received in a request sent to www/errorreport.php was not properly sanitized, it was possible to inject newline characters into it, effectively allowing a malicious user to inject new log lines with arbitrary content.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5225", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSimplesamlphp\u00bbSimplesamlphpVersions  before (<) 1.18.4cpe:2.3:a:simplesamlphp:simplesamlphp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://simplesamlphp.org/security/202001-02", "ref_desc": "SimpleSAMLphpVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/security/advisories/GHSA-6gc6-m364-85ww", "ref_desc": "Log injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
