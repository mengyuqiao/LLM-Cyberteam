{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9510", "Description": "A vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 10 1803 and Windows Server 2019 and later systems can allow authenticated RDP-connected clients to gain access to user sessions without needing to interact with the Windows lock screen. Should a network anomaly trigger a temporary RDP disconnect, Automatic Reconnection of the RDP session will be restored to an unlocked state, regardless of how the remote system was left. By interrupting network connectivity of a system, an attacker with access to a system being used as a Windows RDP client can gain access to a connected remote system, regardless of whether or not the remote system was locked. This issue affects Microsoft Windows 10, version 1803 and later, and Microsoft Windows Server 2019, version 2019 and later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9510", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1803cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1803:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows Server 2019\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2019:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-17  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-08  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-12-22  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-20  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.08%  0.05%  -2.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/288/Authentication-Bypass-Using-an-Alternate-Path-or-Channel.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/576688/", "ref_desc": "VU#576688 - Microsoft Windows RDP can bypass the Windows lock screenThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/1fd171de-a1b5-4721-86bf-082e4a375049/rds-2019-but-probably-other-versions-as-well-locked-rdp-session-logs-in-after-session-reconnect", "ref_desc": "RDS 2019 (but probably other versions as well): locked RDP session logs in after session reconnectPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc732713(v=ws.11)", "ref_desc": "Configure Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Services Connections | Microsoft DocsPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/e729948a-3f4e-4568-9aef-d355e30b5389", "ref_desc": "[MS-RDPBCGR]: Automatic Reconnection | Microsoft DocsPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
