{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18792", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata 5.0.0. It is possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake FIN packet. The fake FIN packet is injected just before the PUSH ACK packet we want to bypass. The PUSH ACK packet (containing the data) will be ignored by Suricata because it overlaps the FIN packet (the sequence and ack number are identical in the two packets). The client will ignore the fake FIN packet because the ACK flag is not set. Both linux and windows clients are ignoring the injected packet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18792", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOisf\u00bbSuricataVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.5andbefore (<) 4.1.6cpe:2.3:a:oisf:suricata:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOisf\u00bbSuricata\u00bbVersion:5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:oisf:suricata:5.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.05%  1.55%  +0.50 \n 2  2024-05-01  1.48%  1.05%  -0.43 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  1.48%  +0.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/01/msg00032.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2087-1] suricata security updateThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/90Avpdx6CdrpviPlvltUyxVcmn8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/3394", "ref_desc": "Bug #3394: TCP evasion technique by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake packet (4.1.x) - Suricata - Open Information Security FoundationExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/fa692df37a796c3330c81988d15ef1a219afc006", "ref_desc": "stream: reject broken ACK packets \u00b7 OISF/suricata@fa692df \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/1c63d3905852f746ccde7e2585600b2199cefb4b", "ref_desc": "stream: reject broken ACK packets \u00b7 OISF/suricata@1c63d39 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/3324", "ref_desc": "Bug #3324: TCP evasion technique by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake packet - Suricata - Open Information Security FoundationExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
