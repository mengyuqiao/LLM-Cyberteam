{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8445", "Description": "In OSSEC-HIDS 2.7 through 3.5.0, the OS_CleanMSG function in ossec-analysisd doesn't remove or encode terminal control characters or newlines from processed log messages. In many cases, those characters are later logged. Because newlines (\\n) are permitted in messages processed by ossec-analysisd, it may be possible to inject nested events into the ossec log. Use of terminal control characters may allow obfuscating events or executing commands when viewed through vulnerable terminal emulators. This may be an unauthenticated remote attack for certain types and origins of logged data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8445", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nOssec\u00bbOssecVersions  from including (>=) 2.7andup to, including, (<=) 3.5.0cpe:2.3:a:ossec:ossec:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.81% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.55%  0.81%  +0.26 \n 2  2024-09-14  0.71%  0.55%  -0.16 \n 3  2023-11-18  0.59%  0.71%  +0.12 \n 4  2023-06-18  0.42%  0.59%  +0.17 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.42%  -0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1814", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-8445: analysisd: OS_CleanMSG allows control characters in msg. \u00b7 Issue #1814 \u00b7 ossec/ossec-hids \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ossec.net/", "ref_desc": "OSSEC - World's Most Widely Used Host Intrusion Detection System - HIDSVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fjGa5f1MwlT2YT7_RQ8eh6QpWmc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-33", "ref_desc": "OSSEC: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202007-33) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JU7TjSiXXG2VVmO6boNtHF8YkIQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1821", "ref_desc": "OSSEC-HIDS Security Audit Findings \u00b7 Issue #1821 \u00b7 ossec/ossec-hids \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zHTMNPcpGKwIXzuJba_V6Hkb8iY.html"}]}
