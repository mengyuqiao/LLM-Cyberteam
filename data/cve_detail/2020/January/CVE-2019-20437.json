When a custom claim dialect with an XSS payload is configured in the identity provider basic claim configuration, that payload gets executed, if a user picks up that dialect's URI as the provisioning claim in the advanced claim configuration of the same Identity Provider. The attacker also needs to have privileges to log in to the management console, and to add and update identity provider configurations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20437", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nWso2\u00bbIdentity Server\u00bbVersion:5.7.0cpe:2.3:a:wso2:identity_server:5.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWso2\u00bbIdentity Server\u00bbVersion:5.8.0cpe:2.3:a:wso2:identity_server:5.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWso2\u00bbApi Manager\u00bbVersion:2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:wso2:api_manager:2.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-15  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/Security+Advisory+WSO2-2019-0635", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory WSO2-2019-0635 - WSO2 Platform Security - WSO2 DocumentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cybersecurityworks.com/zerodays/cve-2019-20437-wso2.html", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-20437 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in WSO2 ProductExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cybersecurityworks/Disclosed/issues/20", "ref_desc": "Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in \"malicious dialect URI\" on WSO2 Product - (WSO2 Identity Server version 5.7.0) \u00b7 Issue #20 \u00b7 cybersecurityworks/Disclosed \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
