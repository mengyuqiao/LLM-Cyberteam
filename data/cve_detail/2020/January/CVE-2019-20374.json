{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-20374", "Description": "A mutation cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Typora through 0.9.9.31.2 on macOS and through 0.9.81 on Linux leads to Remote Code Execution through Mermaid code blocks. To exploit this vulnerability, one must open a file in Typora. The XSS vulnerability is then triggered due to improper HTML sanitization. Given that the application is based on the Electron framework, the XSS leads to remote code execution in an unsandboxed environment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20374", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nTypora\u00bbTyporaVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.9.9.31.2cpe:2.3:a:typora:typora:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/A\nTypora\u00bbTyporaVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.9.81cpe:2.3:a:typora:typora:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.58%  0.80%  +0.22 \n 2  2024-10-09  0.46%  0.58%  +0.12 \n 3  2023-09-26  0.48%  0.46%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.69%  0.48%  -1.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/4e8af7b2c4a159b683d317e02c5cbddb86dc4a0e", "ref_desc": "Added better check for attribute based mXSS \u00b7 cure53/DOMPurify@4e8af7b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues/3124", "ref_desc": "Typora RCE via mXSS \u00b7 Issue #3124 \u00b7 typora/typora-issues \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
