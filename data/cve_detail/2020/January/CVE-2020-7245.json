{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7245", "Description": "Incorrect username validation in the registration process of CTFd v2.0.0 - v2.2.2 allows an attacker to take over an arbitrary account if the username is known and emails are enabled on the CTFd instance. To exploit the vulnerability, one must register with a username identical to the victim's username, but with white space inserted before and/or after the username. This will register the account with the same username as the victim. After initiating a password reset for the new account, CTFd will reset the victim's account password due to the username collision.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7245", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCtfd\u00bbCtfdVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.2.2cpe:2.3:a:ctfd:ctfd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/releases/tag/2.2.3", "ref_desc": "Release 2.2.3 \u00b7 CTFd/CTFd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/pull/1218", "ref_desc": "Strip spaces on registration and refine password reset by ColdHeat \u00b7 Pull Request #1218 \u00b7 CTFd/CTFd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
