{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5224", "Description": "In Django User Sessions (django-user-sessions) before 1.7.1, the views provided allow users to terminate specific sessions. The session key is used to identify sessions, and thus included in the rendered HTML. In itself this is not a problem. However if the website has an XSS vulnerability, the session key could be extracted by the attacker and a session takeover could happen.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5224", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDjango-user-sessions Project\u00bbDjango-user-sessionsVersions  before (<) 1.7.1cpe:2.3:a:django-user-sessions_project:django-user-sessions:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Bouke/django-user-sessions/security/advisories/GHSA-5fq8-3q2f-4m5g", "ref_desc": "Session key exposure through session list \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jazzband/django-user-sessions \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jazzband/django-user-sessions/commit/f0c4077e7d1436ba6d721af85cee89222ca5d2d9", "ref_desc": "Don't expose session keys in views \u00b7 jazzband/django-user-sessions@f0c4077 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
