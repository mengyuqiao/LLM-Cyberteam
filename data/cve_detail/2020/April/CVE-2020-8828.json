{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8828", "Description": "As of v1.5.0, the default admin password is set to the argocd-server pod name. For insiders with access to the cluster or logs, this issue could be abused for privilege escalation, as Argo has privileged roles. A malicious insider is the most realistic threat, but pod names are not meant to be kept secret and could wind up just about anywhere.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8828", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  before (<) 1.5.0cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.98% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.43%  0.98%  +0.55 \n 2  2023-08-12  0.43%  0.43%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-04-12  0.30%  0.43%  +0.13 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.30%  -0.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1188/Initialization-of-a-Resource-with-an-Insecure-Default.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 argoproj/argo \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kkRmTzlIhIf0aNMTrVibY85sjJ0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/security_considerations/", "ref_desc": "Security Considerations - Argo CD - Declarative GitOps CD for KubernetesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Onm-4_NVNOiL9jvroShONv9j1qM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.soluble.ai/blog/argo-cves-2020", "ref_desc": "Argo CVEsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qDQZVzNAo4sdbTgPhhrPWv3SG0A.html"}]}
