{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11725", "Description": "snd_ctl_elem_add in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.3 has a count=info->owner line, which later affects a private_size*count multiplication for unspecified \"interesting side effects.\" NOTE: kernel engineers dispute this finding, because it could be relevant only if new callers were added that were unfamiliar with the misuse of the info->owner field to represent data unrelated to the \"owner\" concept. The existing callers, SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_ADD and SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE, have been designed to misuse the info->owner field in a safe way", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11725", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.6.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-08-16  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lore.kernel.org/alsa-devel/s5h4ktmlfpx.wl-tiwai%40suse.de/", "ref_desc": "Re: [RFC v2] ALSA: control: fix a error handling exist in snd_ctl_elem_add - Takashi Iwai", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/3b2549a3740efb8af0150415737067d87e466c5b/sound/core/control.c#L1434-L1474", "ref_desc": "linux/control.c at 3b2549a3740efb8af0150415737067d87e466c5b \u00b7 torvalds/linux \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/yabbadabbadrew/status/1248632267028582400", "ref_desc": "Drew Yao on Twitter: \"@grsecurity A guess: count = info-&gt;owner; does not seem right. owner is supposed to be a pid.\" / TwitterThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lore.kernel.org/alsa-devel/s5h4ktmlfpx.wl-tiwai@suse.de/", "ref_desc": "Re: [RFC v2] ALSA: control: fix a error handling exist in snd_ctl_elem_add - Takashi Iwai", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
