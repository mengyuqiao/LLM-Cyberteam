This does not directly lead to a security issue, yet it might aid attackers in their efforts to exploit other problems. The flaws unnecessarily make the servers more prone to Clickjacking, channel downgrade attacks and other similar client-based attack vectors.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1728", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbKeycloakVersions  before (<) 10.0.0cpe:2.3:a:redhat:keycloak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nQuarkus\u00bbQuarkusVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.4.2cpe:2.3:a:quarkus:quarkus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-358 Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/358/Improperly-Implemented-Security-Check-for-Standard.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1021 Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1021/Improper-Restriction-of-Rendered-UI-Layers-or-Frames.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1728", "ref_desc": "1800585 \u2013 (CVE-2020-1728) CVE-2020-1728 keycloak: security headers missing on REST endpointsIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
