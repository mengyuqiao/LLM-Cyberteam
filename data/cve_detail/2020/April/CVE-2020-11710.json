{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11710", "Description": "An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. \u201c1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating \u2018An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.\u2019 is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a \u201cPatch\u201d link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11710", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKonghq\u00bbDocker-kong\u00bbForKongVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:konghq:docker-kong:*:*:*:*:*:kong:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "11.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.94%  11.08%  +9.14 \n 2  2024-10-24  2.64%  1.94%  -0.70 \n 3  2024-03-19  2.68%  2.64%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-02-15  3.47%  2.68%  -0.79 \n 5  2024-01-31  2.93%  3.47%  +0.55 \n 6  2024-01-13  2.08%  2.93%  +0.84 \n 7  2023-04-01  2.20%  2.08%  -0.11 \n 8  2023-03-07  83.07%  2.20%  -80.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611", "ref_desc": "fix(admin) bind the kong admin api port to 127 (#1869) \u00b7 Kong/docs.konghq.com@d693827 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949", "ref_desc": "docs(admin-api) securing the admin api \u00b7 Kong/docs.konghq.com@e99cf87 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kong/kong", "ref_desc": "GitHub - Kong/kong: \ud83e\udd8d The Cloud-Native API GatewayThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong/commit/dfa095cadf7e8309155be51982d8720daf32e31c", "ref_desc": "chore(admin) restrict the admin port to 127 (#350) \u00b7 Kong/docker-kong@dfa095c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
