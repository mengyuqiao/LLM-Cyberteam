{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3262", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol handler of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3262", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bb5508 Wireless Controller Firmware\u00bbVersion:8.8(120.0)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:5508_wireless_controller_firmware:8.8\\(120.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb5508 Wireless Controller\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bb5520 Wireless Controller Firmware\u00bbVersion:8.8(120.0)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:5520_wireless_controller_firmware:8.8\\(120.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb5520 Wireless Controller\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-capwap-dos-Y2sD9uEw", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller CAPWAP Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
