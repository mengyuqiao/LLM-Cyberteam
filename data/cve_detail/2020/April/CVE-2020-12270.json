{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12270", "Description": "React Native Bluetooth Scan in Bluezone 1.0.0 uses six-character alphanumeric IDs, which might make it easier for remote attackers to interfere with COVID-19 contact tracing by using many IDs. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report because the recipient of an F1 alert will know it was a false alert if contact-history comparison fails (i.e., an F0 is not actually part of the contact history obtained from the device of this recipient, or this recipient is not actually part of the contact history obtained from the device of an F0)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12270", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBluezone\u00bbBluezone\u00bbVersion:1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:bluezone:bluezone:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.55%  0.30%  -0.25 \n 2  2024-04-03  0.48%  0.55%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-06-28  0.34%  0.48%  +0.14 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.32%  0.34%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/BluezoneGlobal/react-native-bluetooth-scan/blob/d9ee70fd594093a30e50b6e62a7593a8397c2dab/lib/android/src/main/java/com/scan/TraceCovidModule.java#L98", "ref_desc": "react-native-bluetooth-scan/TraceCovidModule.java at d9ee70fd594093a30e50b6e62a7593a8397c2dab \u00b7 BluezoneGlobal/react-native-bluetooth-scan \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BluezoneGlobal/bluezone-app/blob/afa15fcec391f0edc51d0486a4ca84dd2520bbb3/CHANGELOG.md", "ref_desc": "bluezone-app/CHANGELOG.md at afa15fcec391f0edc51d0486a4ca84dd2520bbb3 \u00b7 BluezoneGlobal/bluezone-app \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bluezone.ai/CVE", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BluezoneGlobal/bluezone-app/blob/afa15fcec391f0edc51d0486a4ca84dd2520bbb3/package.json#L27", "ref_desc": "bluezone-app/package.json at afa15fcec391f0edc51d0486a4ca84dd2520bbb3 \u00b7 BluezoneGlobal/bluezone-app \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BluezoneGlobal/react-native-bluetooth-scan/blob/d9ee70fd594093a30e50b6e62a7593a8397c2dab/lib/android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L11-L12", "ref_desc": "react-native-bluetooth-scan/AndroidManifest.xml at d9ee70fd594093a30e50b6e62a7593a8397c2dab \u00b7 BluezoneGlobal/react-native-bluetooth-scan \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BluezoneGlobal/react-native-bluetooth-scan/blob/d9ee70fd594093a30e50b6e62a7593a8397c2dab/lib/android/src/main/java/com/scan/BluezonerIdGenerator.java#L18-L28", "ref_desc": "react-native-bluetooth-scan/BluezonerIdGenerator.java at d9ee70fd594093a30e50b6e62a7593a8397c2dab \u00b7 BluezoneGlobal/react-native-bluetooth-scan \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://vnhacker.blogspot.com/2020/04/vietnams-contact-tracing-app_26.html", "ref_desc": "Vietnam's contact tracing app broadcasting a fixed IDExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
