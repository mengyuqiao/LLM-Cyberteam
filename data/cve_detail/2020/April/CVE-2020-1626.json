{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1626", "Description": "A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a high rate of specific packets to the device, resulting in a pfemand process crash. The pfemand process is responsible for packet forwarding on the device. By continuously sending the packet flood, an attacker can repeatedly crash the pfemand process causing a sustained Denial of Service. This issue can only be triggered by traffic sent to the device. Transit traffic does not cause this issue. This issue affects all version of Junos OS Evolved prior to 19.1R1-EVO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1626", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nJuniper\u00bbJunos Os Evolved\u00bbVersion:18.3UpdateR1cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_os_evolved:18.3:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kb.juniper.net/JSA11005", "ref_desc": "2020-04 Security Bulletin: Junos OS Evolved: Denial of Service vulnerability in processing high rate of specific packets (CVE-2020-1626) - Juniper NetworksVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6192", "ref_desc": "RFC 6192 - Protecting the Router Control PlaneThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
