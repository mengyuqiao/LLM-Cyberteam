{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12063", "Description": "A certain Postfix 2.10.1-7 package could allow an attacker to send an email from an arbitrary-looking sender via a homoglyph attack, as demonstrated by the similarity of \\xce\\xbf to the 'o' character. This is potentially relevant when the /etc/postfix/sender_login feature is used, because a spoofed outbound message that uses a configured sender address is blocked with a \"Sender address rejected: not logged in\" error message, but a spoofed outbound message that uses a homoglyph of a configured sender address is not blocked. NOTE: some third parties argue that any missed blocking of spoofed outbound messages - except for exact matches to a sender address in the /etc/postfix/sender_login file - is outside the design goals of Postfix and thus cannot be considered a Postfix vulnerability", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12063", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPostfix\u00bbPostfix\u00bbVersion:2.10.1cpe:2.3:a:postfix:postfix:2.10.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/23/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - spoofing of local email sender via a homoglyph attackMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/23/12", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: spoofing of local email sender via a homoglyph attackExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
