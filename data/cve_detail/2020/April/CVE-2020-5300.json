{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5300", "Description": "In Hydra (an OAuth2 Server and OpenID Certified\u2122 OpenID Connect Provider written in Go), before version 1.4.0+oryOS.17, when using client authentication method 'private_key_jwt' [1], OpenId specification says the following about assertion `jti`: \"A unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties\". Hydra does not check the uniqueness of this `jti` value. Exploiting this vulnerability is somewhat difficult because: - TLS protects against MITM which makes it difficult to intercept valid tokens for replay attacks - The expiry time of the JWT gives only a short window of opportunity where it could be replayed This has been patched in version v1.4.0+oryOS.17", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5300", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nORY\u00bbHydraVersions  before (<) 1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:ory:hydra:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/700d17d3b7d507de1b1d459a7261d6fb2571ebe3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-3p3g-vpw6-4w66 \u00b7 ory/hydra@700d17d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ory/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-3p3g-vpw6-4w66", "ref_desc": "Disallow replay of `private_key_jwt` by blacklisting JTIs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ory/hydra \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ory/hydra/releases/tag/v1.4.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.4.0+oryOS.18 \u00b7 ory/hydra \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
