{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11002", "Description": "dropwizard-validation before versions 2.0.3 and 1.3.21 has a remote code execution vulnerability. A server-side template injection was identified in the self-validating feature enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. If you are using a self-validating bean an upgrade to Dropwizard 1.3.21/2.0.3 or later is strongly recommended. The changes introduced in Dropwizard 1.3.19 and 2.0.2 for CVE-2020-5245 unfortunately did not fix the underlying issue completely. The issue has been fixed in dropwizard-validation 1.3.21 and 2.0.3 or later. We strongly recommend upgrading to one of these versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11002", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDropwizard\u00bbDropwizard ValidationVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:dropwizard:dropwizard_validation:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDropwizard\u00bbDropwizard ValidationVersions  before (<) 1.3.21cpe:2.3:a:dropwizard:dropwizard_validation:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.71%  7.41%  +2.70 \n 2  2024-07-06  4.16%  4.71%  +0.55 \n 3  2023-04-28  2.98%  4.16%  +1.18 \n 4  2023-04-14  2.12%  2.98%  +0.86 \n 5  2023-03-17  1.72%  2.12%  +0.40 \n 6  2023-03-07  5.47%  1.72%  -3.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/3209", "ref_desc": "Disable message interpolation in ConstraintViolations by default by joschi \u00b7 Pull Request #3209 \u00b7 dropwizard/dropwizard \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/6.1/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-hibernateconstraintvalidatorcontext", "ref_desc": "Hibernate Validator 6.1.3.Final - Jakarta Bean Validation Reference Implementation: Reference GuideThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/security/policy#reporting-a-vulnerability", "ref_desc": "Security Policy \u00b7 dropwizard/dropwizard \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/commit/d5a512f7abf965275f2a6b913ac4fe778e424242", "ref_desc": "Disable message interpolation in ConstraintViolations by default (#3208) \u00b7 dropwizard/dropwizard@d5a512f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/security/advisories/GHSA-8jpx-m2wh-2v34", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in dropwizard-validation <2.0.3 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dropwizard/dropwizard \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/3208", "ref_desc": "Disable message interpolation in ConstraintViolations by default by joschi \u00b7 Pull Request #3208 \u00b7 dropwizard/dropwizard \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/security/advisories/GHSA-3mcp-9wr4-cjqf", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in dropwizard-validation <2.0.2 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dropwizard/dropwizard \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tdXJvRFEPllxvFPdwDfbcCrzAFk.html"}]}
