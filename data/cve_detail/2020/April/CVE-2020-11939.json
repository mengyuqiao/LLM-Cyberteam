{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11939", "Description": "In nDPI through 3.2 Stable, the SSH protocol dissector has multiple KEXINIT integer overflows that result in a controlled remote heap overflow in concat_hash_string in ssh.c. Due to the granular nature of the overflow primitive and the ability to control both the contents and layout of the nDPI library's heap memory through remote input, this vulnerability may be abused to achieve full Remote Code Execution against any network inspection stack that is linked against nDPI and uses it to perform network traffic analysis.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11939", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNtop\u00bbNdpiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.2cpe:2.3:a:ntop:ndpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.82% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.08%  0.82%  -0.26 \n 2  2023-12-22  0.91%  1.08%  +0.17 \n 3  2023-06-25  0.64%  0.91%  +0.27 \n 4  2023-03-30  0.61%  0.64%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.61%  -1.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2020-051_052-ntop-ndpi", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2020-051, GHSL-2020-052: Multiple vulnerabilities in NTOP nDPI - GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/quc6Kp5MVzxv29Af1YlUZgyVY6w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/commit/7ce478a58b4dd29a8d1e6f4e9df2f778613d9202", "ref_desc": "ssh: fixing unsigned overflow leading to heap overflow \u00b7 ntop/nDPI@7ce478a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
