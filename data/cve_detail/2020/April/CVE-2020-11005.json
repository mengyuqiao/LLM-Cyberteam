{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11005", "Description": "The WindowsHello open source library (NuGet HaemmerElectronics.SeppPenner.WindowsHello), before version 1.0.4, has a vulnerability where encrypted data could potentially be decrypted without needing authentication. If the library is used to encrypt text and write the output to a txt file, another executable could be able to decrypt the text using the static method NCryptDecrypt from this same library without the need to use Windows Hello Authentication again. This has been patched in version 1.0.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11005", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWindowshello Project\u00bbWindowshelloVersions  before (<) 1.0.4cpe:2.3:a:windowshello_project:windowshello:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/288/Authentication-Bypass-Using-an-Alternate-Path-or-Channel.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/SeppPenner/WindowsHello/security/advisories/GHSA-wvpv-ffcv-r6cw", "ref_desc": "Internal NCryptDecrypt method could be used by other libraries as well. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 SeppPenner/WindowsHello \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/SeppPenner/WindowsHello/issues/3", "ref_desc": "[Question] Security of the Encrypted data \u00b7 Issue #3 \u00b7 SeppPenner/WindowsHello \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
