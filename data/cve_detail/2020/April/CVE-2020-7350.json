{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7350", "Description": "Rapid7 Metasploit Framework versions before 5.0.85 suffers from an instance of CWE-78: OS Command Injection, wherein the libnotify plugin accepts untrusted user-supplied data via a remote computer's hostname or service name. An attacker can create a specially-crafted hostname or service name to be imported by Metasploit from a variety of sources and trigger a command injection on the operator's terminal. Note, only the Metasploit Framework and products that expose the plugin system is susceptible to this issue -- notably, this does not include Rapid7 Metasploit Pro. Also note, this vulnerability cannot be triggered through a normal scan operation -- the attacker would have to supply a file that is processed with the db_import command.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7350", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRapid7\u00bbMetasploitVersions  before (<) 5.0.85cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "19.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.80%  19.25%  +18.45 \n 2  2024-03-23  1.02%  0.80%  -0.22 \n 3  2024-02-19  0.97%  1.02%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-10-13  1.36%  0.97%  -0.40 \n 5  2023-08-26  1.50%  1.36%  -0.14 \n 6  2023-05-26  1.53%  1.50%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-05-10  1.88%  1.53%  -0.35 \n 8  2023-04-11  2.36%  1.88%  -0.48 \n 9  2023-03-07  22.73%  2.36%  -20.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues/13026", "ref_desc": "possible vulnerability in libnotify \u00b7 Issue #13026 \u00b7 rapid7/metasploit-framework \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
