{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5270", "Description": "In PrestaShop between versions 1.7.6.0 and 1.7.6.5, there is an open redirection when using back parameter. The impacts can be many, and vary from the theft of information and credentials to the redirection to malicious websites containing attacker-controlled content, which in some cases even cause XSS attacks. So even though an open redirection might sound harmless at first, the impacts of it can be severe should it be exploitable. The problem is fixed in 1.7.6.5", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5270", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nPrestashop\u00bbPrestashopVersions  after (>) 1.7.6.0andbefore (<) 1.7.6.5cpe:2.3:a:prestashop:prestashop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/cd2219dca49965ae8421bb5a53fc301f3f23c458", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-375w-q56h-h7qc \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop@cd2219d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-375w-q56h-h7qc", "ref_desc": "Open redirection when using back parameter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
