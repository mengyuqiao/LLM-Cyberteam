{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7613", "Description": "clamscan through 1.2.0 is vulnerable to Command Injection. It is possible to inject arbitrary commands as part of the `_is_clamav_binary` function located within `Index.js`. It should be noted that this vulnerability requires a pre-requisite that a folder should be created with the same command that will be chained to execute. This lowers the risk of this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7613", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nClamscan Project\u00bbClamscanVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:clamscan_project:clamscan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "12.68% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.67%  12.68%  +11.02 \n 2  2024-03-14  2.34%  1.67%  -0.68 \n 3  2024-01-08  2.05%  2.34%  +0.29 \n 4  2023-12-06  2.88%  2.05%  -0.83 \n 5  2023-09-28  4.02%  2.88%  -1.14 \n 6  2023-08-11  3.92%  4.02%  +0.10 \n 7  2023-07-25  4.12%  3.92%  -0.20 \n 8  2023-05-11  4.62%  4.12%  -0.50 \n 9  2023-04-25  1.19%  4.62%  +3.43 \n 10  2023-03-27  0.84%  1.19%  +0.35 \n 11  2023-03-07  2.06%  0.84%  -1.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CLAMSCAN-564113", "ref_desc": "Command Injection in clamscan | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kylefarris/clamscan/blob/master/index.js#L34", "ref_desc": "clamscan/index.js at master \u00b7 kylefarris/clamscan \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
