{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12078", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12078", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpmantek\u00bbOpen-audit\u00bbVersion:3.3.1cpe:2.3:a:opmantek:open-audit:3.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.73% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  39.61%  2.73%  -36.88 \n 2  2024-10-25  40.67%  39.61%  -1.06 \n 3  2024-09-09  42.74%  40.67%  -2.08 \n 4  2024-01-14  39.53%  42.74%  +3.21 \n 5  2023-07-16  42.01%  39.53%  -2.48 \n 6  2023-06-01  34.48%  42.01%  +7.53 \n 7  2023-05-16  35.69%  34.48%  -1.21 \n 8  2023-05-02  31.85%  35.69%  +3.84 \n 9  2023-04-17  28.75%  31.85%  +3.10 \n 10  2023-03-21  32.60%  28.75%  -3.85 \n 11  2023-03-07  14.47%  32.60%  +18.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://shells.systems/open-audit-v3-3-1-remote-command-execution-cve-2020-12078/", "ref_desc": "Open-AudIT v3.3.1 Remote Command Execution (CVE-2020-12078) - Shells.SystemsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157477/Open-AudIT-Professional-3.3.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Open-AudIT Professional 3.3.1 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HHTRHY6Q8NVU5tYH7mkaYnoj1S0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Opmantek/open-audit/commit/6ffc7f9032c55eaa1c37cf5e070809b7211c7e9a", "ref_desc": "Validate correct character for subnet and exclude_ip attributes when \u2026 \u00b7 Opmantek/open-audit@6ffc7f9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/mhaskar/dca62d0f0facc13f6364b8ed88d5a7fd", "ref_desc": "Open-AudIT Professional v3.3.1 Remote Code Execution \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
