{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1978", "Description": "TechSupport files generated on Palo Alto Networks VM Series firewalls for Microsoft Azure platform configured with high availability (HA) inadvertently collect Azure dashboard service account credentials. These credentials are equivalent to the credentials associated with the Contributor role in Azure. A user with the credentials will be able to manage all the Azure resources in the subscription except for granting access to other resources. These credentials do not allow login access to the VMs themselves. This issue affects VM Series Plugin versions before 1.0.9 for PAN-OS 9.0. This issue does not affect VM Series in non-HA configurations or on other cloud platforms. It does not affect hardware firewall appliances. Since becoming aware of the issue, Palo Alto Networks has safely deleted all the tech support files with the credentials. We now filter and remove these credentials from all TechSupport files sent to us. The TechSupport files uploaded to Palo Alto Networks systems were only accessible by authorized personnel with valid Palo Alto Networks credentials. We do not have any evidence of malicious access or use of these credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1978", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-os\u00bbVersion:9.0.0cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:9.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbVm-series\u00bbForAzureVersions  from including (>=) 1.0andbefore (<) 1.0.9cpe:2.3:a:paloaltonetworks:vm-series:*:*:*:*:*:azure:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-255", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/255/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-1978", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-1978 VM-Series on Microsoft Azure: Inadvertent collection of credentials in Tech support files on HA configured VMsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
