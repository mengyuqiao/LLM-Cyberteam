{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7947", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Login by Auth0 plugin before 4.0.0 for WordPress. It has numerous fields that can contain data that is pulled from different sources. One issue with this is that the data isn't sanitized, and no input validation is performed, before the exporting of the user data. This can lead to (at least) CSV injection if a crafted Excel document is uploaded.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7947", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAuth0\u00bbLogin By Auth0\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:a:auth0:login_by_auth0:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.43% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.53%  0.43%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-02-04  0.55%  0.53%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-01-20  0.46%  0.55%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.46%  -0.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1236 Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1236/Improper-Neutralization-of-Formula-Elements-in-a-CSV-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/wp-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-59vf-cgfw-6h6v", "ref_desc": "Several vulnerabilities in WordPress Plugin for Auth0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 auth0/wp-auth0 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2PFZS1lSKgQv-I9Qv-El2oyYwZk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/auth0/#developers", "ref_desc": "Login by Auth0 \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.orgRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3B2urZSoE2C1yoot5_HI7rss63U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress", "ref_desc": "Login by Auth0 WordPress PluginProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/p6gjjvtvBtpFV1noGL9_5gAWOk4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://auth0.com/docs/security/bulletins/2020-03-31_wpauth0", "ref_desc": "Security Update for WordPress Plugin for Auth0Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Vk_uk8kS-1CMfajL6Ll4ga-wXYs.html"}]}
