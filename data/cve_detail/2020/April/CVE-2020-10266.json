{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10266", "Description": "UR+ (Universal Robots+) is a platform of hardware and software component sellers, for Universal Robots robots. When installing any of these components in the robots (e.g. in the UR10), no integrity checks are performed. Moreover, the SDK for making such components can be easily obtained from Universal Robots. An attacker could exploit this flaw by crafting a custom component with the SDK, performing Person-In-The-Middle attacks (PITM) and shipping the maliciously-crafted component on demand.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10266", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nUniversal-robots\u00bbUR+\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:universal-robots:ur\\+:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Universal-robots\u00bbUr10\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Universal-robots\u00bbUR3\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Universal-robots\u00bbUR5\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-353 Missing Support for Integrity Check", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/353/Missing-Support-for-Integrity-Check.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/1487", "ref_desc": "RVD#1487: No integrity checks on UR+ platform artifacts when installed in the robot \u00b7 Issue #1487 \u00b7 aliasrobotics/RVD \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
