{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10267", "Description": "Universal Robots control box CB 3.1 across firmware versions (tested on 1.12.1, 1.12, 1.11 and 1.10) does not encrypt or protect in any way the intellectual property artifacts installed from the UR+ platform of hardware and software components (URCaps). These files (*.urcaps) are stored under '/root/.urcaps' as plain zip files containing all the logic to add functionality to the UR3, UR5 and UR10 robots. This flaw allows attackers with access to the robot or the robot network (while in combination with other flaws) to retrieve and easily exfiltrate all installed intellectual property.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10267", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nUniversal-robots\u00bbUr SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.14989andup to, including, (<=) 3.1.18213cpe:2.3:a:universal-robots:ur_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Universal-robots\u00bbUr10\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Universal-robots\u00bbUR3\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Universal-robots\u00bbUR5\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.49%  +0.19 \n 2  2024-03-11  0.24%  0.30%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-08-10  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/1489", "ref_desc": "RVD#1489: Unprotected intelectual property in Universal Robots controller CB 3.1 across firmware versions \u00b7 Issue #1489 \u00b7 aliasrobotics/RVD \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
