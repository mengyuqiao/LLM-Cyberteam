{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11037", "Description": "In Wagtail before versions 2.7.3 and 2.8.2, a potential timing attack exists on pages or documents that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail's \"Privacy\" controls. This password check is performed through a character-by-character string comparison, and so an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this check to a high degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of the password. This is [understood to be feasible on a local network, but not on the public internet](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-developers/iAaq0pvHXuA/fpUuwjK3i2wJ).\n\nPrivacy settings that restrict access to pages/documents on a per-user or per-group basis (as opposed to a shared password) are unaffected by this vulnerability.\n\nThis has been patched in 2.7.3, 2.8.2, 2.9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11037", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 2.8andbefore (<) 2.8.2cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtail\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.7andbefore (<) 2.7.3cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/bac3cd0a26b023e595cf2959aae7da15bb5e4340", "ref_desc": "Use constant_time_compare for view restriction password checks \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@bac3cd0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/3c030490ed575bb9cd01dfb3a890477dcaeb2edf", "ref_desc": "Use constant_time_compare for view restriction password checks \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@3c03049 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/ba9d424bd1ca5ce1910d3de74f5cc07214fbfb11", "ref_desc": "Use constant_time_compare for view restriction password checks \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@ba9d424 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-jjjr-3jcw-f8v6", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/b76ab57ee859732b9cf9287d380493ab24061090", "ref_desc": "Release note for CVE-2020-11037 in 2.9 \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@b76ab57 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
