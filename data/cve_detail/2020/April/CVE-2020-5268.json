{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5268", "Description": "In Saml2 Authentication Services for ASP.NET versions before 1.0.2, and between 2.0.0 and 2.6.0, there is a vulnerability in how tokens are validated in some cases. Saml2 tokens are usually used as bearer tokens - a caller that presents a token is assumed to be the subject of the token. There is also support in the Saml2 protocol for issuing tokens that is tied to a subject through other means, e.g. holder-of-key where possession of a private key must be proved. The Sustainsys.Saml2 library incorrectly treats all incoming tokens as bearer tokens, even though they have another subject confirmation method specified. This could be used by an attacker that could get access to Saml2 tokens with another subject confirmation method than bearer. The attacker could then use such a token to create a log in session. This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.0.2 and 2.7.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5268", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSustainsys\u00bbSaml2Versions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:sustainsys:saml2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSustainsys\u00bbSaml2Versions  before (<) 1.0.2cpe:2.3:a:sustainsys:saml2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.23%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-303 Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/303/Incorrect-Implementation-of-Authentication-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2/commit/e58e0a1aff2b1ead6aca080b7cdced55ee6d5241", "ref_desc": "Fix token replay detection \u00b7 Sustainsys/Saml2@e58e0a1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1XnnLJmGWVHaAkWE0R7Cja-4XlI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2/issues/712", "ref_desc": "Reserved Issue# \u00b7 Issue #712 \u00b7 Sustainsys/Saml2 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Bypyl7wnuNV-3G4xgKuTGHpisNo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2/security/advisories/GHSA-9475-xg6m-j7pw", "ref_desc": "Subject Confirmation Method not Validated \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sustainsys/Saml2 \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sustainsys.Saml2/", "ref_desc": "NuGet Gallery | Sustainsys.Saml2 2.7.0Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
