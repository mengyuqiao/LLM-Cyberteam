{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8142", "Description": "A security restriction bypass vulnerability has been discovered in Revive Adserver version < 5.0.5 by HackerOne user hoangn144. Revive Adserver, like many other applications, requires the logged in user to type the current password in order to change the e-mail address or the password. It was however possible for anyone with access to a Revive Adserver admin user interface to bypass such check and change e-email address or password of the currently logged in user by altering the form payload.The attack requires physical access to the user interface of a logged in user. If the POST payload was altered by turning the \u201cpwold\u201d parameter into an array, Revive Adserver would fetch and authorise the operation even if no password was provided.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8142", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRevive-adserver\u00bbRevive AdserverVersions  before (<) 5.0.5cpe:2.3:a:revive-adserver:revive_adserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-08-07  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2020-002/", "ref_desc": "Revive Adserver Security Advisory SA-2020-002Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7NrkIQLxoT7YdypHEhwrLdeO_mM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/792895", "ref_desc": "#792895 bypass old password with array in /admin/account-user-email.phpExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
