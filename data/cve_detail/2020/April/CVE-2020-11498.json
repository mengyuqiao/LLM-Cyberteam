{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11498", "Description": "Slack Nebula through 1.1.0 contains a relative path vulnerability that allows a low-privileged attacker to execute code in the context of the root user via tun_darwin.go or tun_windows.go. A user can also use Nebula to execute arbitrary code in the user's own context, e.g., for user-level persistence or to bypass security controls. NOTE: the vendor states that this \"requires a high degree of access and other preconditions that are tough to achieve.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11498", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSlack\u00bbNebulaVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:slack:nebula:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.35%  +0.15 \n 2  2023-08-21  0.21%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-08-06  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.21%  -1.23 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.pwn3d.org/posts/7918501-slack-nebula-relative-path-bug-bounty-disclosure", "ref_desc": "Slack Nebula - Relative Path Bug Bounty Disclosure (Med: $750) \u00ab pwn3d.orgExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/pull/191", "ref_desc": "use absolute paths on darwin and windows by wadey \u00b7 Pull Request #191 \u00b7 slackhq/nebula \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
