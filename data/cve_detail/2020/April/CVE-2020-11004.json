{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11004", "Description": "SQL Injection was discovered in Admidio before version 3.3.13. The main cookie parameter is concatenated into a SQL query without any input validation/sanitization, thus an attacker without logging in, can send a GET request with arbitrary SQL queries appended to the cookie parameter and execute SQL queries. The vulnerability impacts the confidentiality of the system. This has been patched in version 3.3.13.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11004", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nAdmidio\u00bbAdmidioVersions  before (<) 3.3.13cpe:2.3:a:admidio:admidio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.14%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-02-27  0.14%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-02-12  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/issues/908", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated Blind SQL injection \u00b7 Issue #908 \u00b7 Admidio/admidio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-qh57-rcff-gx54", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated Blind SQL injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Admidio/admidio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/commit/ea5d6f114b151ed11ec0ad7cb47bd729e77a874a", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated Blind SQL injection #908 \u00b7 Admidio/admidio@ea5d6f1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
