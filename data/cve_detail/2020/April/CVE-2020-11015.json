{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11015", "Description": "A vulnerability has been disclosed in thinx-device-api IoT Device Management Server before version 2.5.0. Device MAC address can be spoofed. This means initial registration requests without UDID and spoofed MAC address may pass to create new UDID with same MAC address. Full impact needs to be reviewed further. Applies to all (mostly ESP8266/ESP32) users. This has been fixed in firmware version 2.5.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11015", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nThinx-device-api Project\u00bbThinx-device-api\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.5.0cpe:2.3:a:thinx-device-api_project:thinx-device-api:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-04-21  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-11  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-31  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-10-05  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-08-29  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/suculent/thinx-device-api/security/advisories/GHSA-5x54-39xq-cwvc", "ref_desc": "Device Authentication Vulnerability: Possible MAC address collision \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 suculent/thinx-device-api \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
