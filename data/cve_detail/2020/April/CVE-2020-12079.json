{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12079", "Description": "Beaker before 0.8.9 allows a sandbox escape, enabling system access and code execution. This occurs because Electron context isolation is not used, and therefore an attacker can conduct a prototype-pollution attack against the Electron internal messaging API.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12079", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBeakerbrowser\u00bbBeakerVersions  before (<) 0.8.9cpe:2.3:a:beakerbrowser:beaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-19  0.58%  0.41%  -0.17 \n 2  2024-06-02  0.49%  0.58%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-08-26  0.35%  0.49%  +0.14 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.24%  0.35%  +0.10 \n 5  2023-03-29  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.23%  -1.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/releases/tag/0.8.9", "ref_desc": "Release Beaker 0.8.9 \u00b7 beakerbrowser/beaker \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/1519", "ref_desc": "Critical security issue [solved in 0.8.9] \u00b7 Issue #1519 \u00b7 beakerbrowser/beaker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
