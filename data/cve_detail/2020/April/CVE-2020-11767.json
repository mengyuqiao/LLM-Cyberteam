{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11767", "Description": "Istio through 1.5.1 and Envoy through 1.14.1 have a data-leak issue. If there is a TCP connection (negotiated with SNI over HTTPS) to *.example.com, a request for a domain concurrently configured explicitly (e.g., abc.example.com) is sent to the server(s) listening behind *.example.com. The outcome should instead be 421 Misdirected Request. Imagine a shared caching forward proxy re-using an HTTP/2 connection for a large subnet with many users. If a victim is interacting with abc.example.com, and a server (for abc.example.com) recycles the TCP connection to the forward proxy, the victim's browser may suddenly start sending sensitive data to a *.example.com server. This occurs because the forward proxy between the victim and the origin server reuses connections (which obeys the specification), but neither Istio nor Envoy corrects this by sending a 421 error. Similarly, this behavior voids the security model browsers have put in place between domains.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11767", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.14.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.5.1cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.14%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/9429", "ref_desc": "404 NR when using browser on multiple ingress gateways \u00b7 Issue #9429 \u00b7 istio/istio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/6767", "ref_desc": "Envoy does not adhere to HTTP/2 RFC 7540 \u00b7 Issue #6767 \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/13589", "ref_desc": "Istio does not adhere to HTTP/2 RFC 7540 \u00b7 Issue #13589 \u00b7 istio/istio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=954160#c5", "ref_desc": "954160 - Chromium may incorrectly re-use http2 connection for different domainIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
