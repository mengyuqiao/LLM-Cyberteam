{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11628", "Description": "An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11628", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPrimekey\u00bbEjbca\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 6.15.2.6cpe:2.3:a:primekey:ejbca:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nPrimekey\u00bbEjbca\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.3.1.2cpe:2.3:a:primekey:ejbca:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.primekey.com/news/posts/ejbca-security-advisory-protocol-access-control-bypass", "ref_desc": "EJBCA Security Advisory - Protocol Access Control Bypass - News / PrimeKey Announcements - PrimeKey SupportVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
