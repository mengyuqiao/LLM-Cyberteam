{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5303", "Description": "Tendermint before versions 0.33.3, 0.32.10, and 0.31.12 has a denial-of-service vulnerability. Tendermint does not limit the number of P2P connection requests. For each p2p connection, it allocates XXX bytes. Even though this memory is garbage collected once the connection is terminated (due to duplicate IP or reaching a maximum number of inbound peers), temporary memory spikes can lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions. Additionally, Tendermint does not reclaim activeID of a peer after it's removed in Mempool reactor. This does not happen all the time. It only happens when a connection fails (for any reason) before the Peer is created and added to all reactors. RemovePeer is therefore called before AddPeer, which leads to always growing memory (activeIDs map). The activeIDs map has a maximum size of 65535 and the node will panic if this map reaches the maximum. An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting above denial of service), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking. These issues are patched in Tendermint 0.33.3 and 0.32.10.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5303", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nTendermint\u00bbTendermintVersions  from including (>=) 0.33.0andbefore (<) 0.33.3cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTendermint\u00bbTendermintVersions  before (<) 0.31.12cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTendermint\u00bbTendermintVersions  from including (>=) 0.32.0andbefore (<) 0.32.10cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-02-13  0.15%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-01-29  0.13%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/789/Memory-Allocation-with-Excessive-Size-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/commit/e2d6859afd7dba4cf97c7f7d412e7d8fc908d1cd", "ref_desc": "p2p: limit the number of incoming connections \u00b7 tendermint/tendermint@e2d6859 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/security/advisories/GHSA-v24h-pjjv-mcp6", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory Lavender \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tendermint/tendermint \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/820317", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
