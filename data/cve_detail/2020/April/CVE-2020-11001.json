{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11001", "Description": "In Wagtail before versions 2.8.1 and 2.7.2, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on the page revision\ncomparison view within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail\nadmin could potentially craft a page revision history that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform\nactions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to\nthe Wagtail admin.\n\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.2 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.8.1 (for the current 2.8 branch).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11001", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 1.9andup to, including, (<=) 2.7.1cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtail\u00bbVersion:2.8cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:2.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-20  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-04-18  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-v2wc-pfq2-5cm6", "ref_desc": "Possible XSS attack via page revision comparison view \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/61045ceefea114c40ac4b680af58990dbe732389", "ref_desc": "Apply proper HTML escaping on StreamField block comparisons \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@61045ce \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/releases/tag/v2.8.1", "ref_desc": "Release 2.8.1 \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
