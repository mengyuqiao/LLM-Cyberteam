{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5301", "Description": "SimpleSAMLphp versions before 1.18.6 contain an information disclosure vulnerability. The module controller in `SimpleSAML\\Module` that processes requests for pages hosted by modules, has code to identify paths ending with `.php` and process those as PHP code. If no other suitable way of handling the given path exists it presents the file to the browser. The check to identify paths ending with `.php` does not account for uppercase letters. If someone requests a path ending with e.g. `.PHP` and the server is serving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as on Windows, the processing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source code is instead presented to the browser. An attacker may use this issue to gain access to the source code in third-party modules that is meant to be private, or even sensitive. However, the attack surface is considered small, as the attack will only work when SimpleSAMLphp serves such content from a file system that is not case-sensitive, such as on Windows. This issue is fixed in version 1.18.6.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5301", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSimplesamlphp\u00bbSimplesamlphpVersions  before (<) 1.18.6cpe:2.3:a:simplesamlphp:simplesamlphp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-178 Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/178/Improper-Handling-of-Case-Sensitivity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/security/advisories/GHSA-24m3-w8g9-jwpq", "ref_desc": "Information disclosure of source code \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/commit/47968d26a2fd3ed52da70dc09210921d612ce44e", "ref_desc": "Fix source code disclosure on case-insensitive file systems \u00b7 simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp@47968d2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
