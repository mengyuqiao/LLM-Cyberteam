{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8961", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Avira Free-Antivirus before 15.0.2004.1825. The Self-Protection feature does not prohibit a write operation from an external process. Thus, code injection can be used to turn off this feature. After that, one can construct an event that will modify a file at a specific location, and pass this event to the driver, thereby defeating the anti-virus functionality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8961", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAvira\u00bbFree AntivirusVersions  before (<) 15.0.2004.1825cpe:2.3:a:avira:free_antivirus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.avira.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000109798-Avira-Antivirus-for-Windows", "ref_desc": "Avira Antivirus for Windows \u2013 Official Avira Support | Knowledgebase & Customer Support | AviraRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qHw4glT3hy5EbVaePHo6BYGSU2c.html"}]}
