{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11582", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Pulse Secure Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) through 2020-04-06. The applet in tncc.jar, executed on macOS, Linux, and Solaris clients when a Host Checker policy is enforced, launches a TCP server that accepts local connections on a random port. This can be reached by local HTTP clients, because up to 25 invalid lines are ignored, and because DNS rebinding can occur. (This server accepts, for example, a setcookie command that might be relevant to CVE-2020-11581 exploitation.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11582", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPulsesecure\u00bbPulse Connect SecureVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2020-04-06cpe:2.3:a:pulsesecure:pulse_connect_secure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oracle\u00bbSolaris\u00bbVersion:N/A\nPulsesecure\u00bbPulse Policy Secure\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:pulsesecure:pulse_policy_secure:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-08-10  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44426", "ref_desc": "Pulse Security Advisory: SA44426 - 2020-04: Out-of-Cycle Advisory: Multiple Host Checker VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4YM4pydo00VKiO3IVpU1L2ZYsTo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.lsd.cat/g/pulse-host-checker-rce", "ref_desc": "g/pulse-host-checker-rce: MITM RCE Host Checker for Pulse Secure - GogsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Rw0hbY_vHwkIviF2Ae72oaTPU1c.html"}]}
