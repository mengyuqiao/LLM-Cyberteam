{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3273", "Description": "A vulnerability in the 802.11 Generic Advertisement Service (GAS) frame processing function of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the 802.11 GAS frames that are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted 802.11 GAS frame over the air to an access point (AP), and that frame would then be relayed to the affected WLC. Also, an attacker with Layer 3 connectivity to the WLC could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious 802.11 GAS payload in a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) packet to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3273", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bb5508 Wireless Controller Firmware\u00bbVersion:8.5(151.0)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:5508_wireless_controller_firmware:8.5\\(151.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb5508 Wireless Controller\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bb5508 Wireless Controller Firmware\u00bbVersion:8.10(204.92)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:5508_wireless_controller_firmware:8.10\\(204.92\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb5508 Wireless Controller\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bb5520 Wireless Controller Firmware\u00bbVersion:8.5(151.0)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:5520_wireless_controller_firmware:8.5\\(151.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb5520 Wireless Controller\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bb5520 Wireless Controller Firmware\u00bbVersion:8.10(204.92)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:5520_wireless_controller_firmware:8.10\\(204.92\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb5520 Wireless Controller\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-gas-dos-8FsE3AWH", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller 802.11 Generic Advertisement Service Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
