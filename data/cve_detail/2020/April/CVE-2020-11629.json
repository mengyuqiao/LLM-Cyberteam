{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11629", "Description": "An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. The External Command Certificate Validator, which allows administrators to upload external linters to validate certificates, is supposed to save uploaded test certificates to the server. An attacker who has gained access to the CA UI could exploit this to upload malicious scripts to the server. (Risks associated with this issue alone are negligible unless a malicious user already has gained access to the CA UI through other means, as a trusted user is already trusted to upload scripts by virtue of having access to the validator.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11629", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPrimekey\u00bbEjbca\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 6.15.2.6cpe:2.3:a:primekey:ejbca:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nPrimekey\u00bbEjbca\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.3.1.2cpe:2.3:a:primekey:ejbca:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.primekey.com/news/primekey-announcements", "ref_desc": "News / PrimeKey Announcements - PrimeKey SupportVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Bnfa8FAMmzXuY9pix3-JyfZYas0.html"}]}
