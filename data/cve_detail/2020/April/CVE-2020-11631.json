{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-11631", "Description": "An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. An error state can be generated in the CA UI by a malicious user. This, in turn, allows exploitation of other bugs. This follow-on exploitation can lead to privilege escalation and remote code execution. (This is exploitable only when at least one accessible port lacks a requirement for client certificate authentication. These ports are 8442 or 8080 in a standard installation.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11631", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPrimekey\u00bbEjbca\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 6.15.2.6cpe:2.3:a:primekey:ejbca:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nPrimekey\u00bbEjbca\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.3.1.2cpe:2.3:a:primekey:ejbca:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.09%  -1.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.primekey.com/news/primekey-announcements", "ref_desc": "News / PrimeKey Announcements - PrimeKey SupportVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Bnfa8FAMmzXuY9pix3-JyfZYas0.html"}]}
