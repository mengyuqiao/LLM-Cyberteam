{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-5283", "Description": "ViewVC before versions 1.1.28 and 1.2.1 has a XSS vulnerability in CVS show_subdir_lastmod support. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a CVS repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance that also has the `show_subdir_lastmod` feature enabled. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.2.1 and 1.1.28.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5283", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nViewvc\u00bbViewvcVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andbefore (<) 1.2.1cpe:2.3:a:viewvc:viewvc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nViewvc\u00bbViewvcVersions  before (<) 1.1.28cpe:2.3:a:viewvc:viewvc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-28  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2Q2STF2MKT24HXZ3YZIU7CN6F6QM67I5/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 30 Update: viewvc-1.1.28-1.fc30 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/issues/211", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability: CVS lastlog filename not escaped \u00b7 Issue #211 \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/security/advisories/GHSA-xpxf-fvqv-7mfg", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability in CVS show_subdir_lastmod support \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/commit/ad0f966e9a997b17d853a6972ea283d4dcd70fa8", "ref_desc": "issue #211: escape CVS subdir last-modified file name \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc@ad0f966 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
