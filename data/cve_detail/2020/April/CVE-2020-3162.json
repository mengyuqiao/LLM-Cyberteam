{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3162", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) implementation of Cisco IoT Field Network Director could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming CoAP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed CoAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force the CoAP server to stop, interrupting communication to the IoT endpoints.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3162", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIot Field Network DirectorVersions  before (<) 4.6.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:iot_field_network_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iot-coap-dos-WTBu6YTq", "ref_desc": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
