{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3126", "Description": "vulnerability within the Multimedia Viewer feature of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass security protections. The vulnerability is due to missing security warning dialog boxes when a room host views shared multimedia files. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the host role to share files within the Multimedia sharing feature and convincing a former room host to view that file. A warning dialog normally appears cautioning users before the file is displayed; however, the former host would not see that warning dialog, and any shared multimedia would be rendered within the user's browser. The attacker could leverage this behavior to conduct additional attacks by including malicious files within a targeted room host's browser window.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3126", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings Server\u00bbVersion:T39.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings_server:t39.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvs24436", "ref_desc": "Cisco.com Login PageVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
