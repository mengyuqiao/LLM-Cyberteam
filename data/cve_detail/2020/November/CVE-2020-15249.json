{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15249", "Description": "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.469, backend users with access to upload files were permitted to upload SVG files without any sanitization applied to the uploaded files. Since SVG files support being parsed as HTML by browsers, this means that they could theoretically upload Javascript that would be executed on a path under the website's domain (i.e. /storage/app/media/evil.svg), but they would have to convince their target to visit that location directly in the target's browser as the backend does not display SVGs inline anywhere, SVGs are only displayed as image resources in the backend and are thus unable to be executed. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) & v1.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15249", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.319andbefore (<) 1.0.469cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/80aab47f044a2660aa352450f55137598f362aa4", "ref_desc": "Security fixes for v1.0.469 \u00b7 octobercms/library@80aab47 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kXBJQY72uKn_L-g2JC6_ItoJw54.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-fx3v-553x-3c4q", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS by authenticated backend user with access to upload files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
