{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-10937", "Description": "An issue was discovered in IPFS (aka go-ipfs) 0.4.23. An attacker can generate ephemeral identities (Sybils) and leverage the IPFS connection management reputation system to poison other nodes' routing tables, eclipsing the nodes that are the target of the attack from the rest of the network. Later versions, in particular go-ipfs 0.7, mitigate this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10937", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nProtocol\u00bbIpfs\u00bbVersion:0.4.23cpe:2.3:a:protocol:ipfs:0.4.23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-07-19  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-09  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://graz.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/total-eclipse-of-the-heart-disrupting-the-interplanetary-file-sys", "ref_desc": "Total Eclipse of the Heart \u2013 Disrupting the InterPlanetary File System \u2014 Graz University of TechnologyThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-10-30-dht-hardening/", "ref_desc": "Hardening the IPFS public DHT against eclipse attacksVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
