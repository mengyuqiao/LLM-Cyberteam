{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26222", "Description": "Dependabot is a set of packages for automated dependency management for Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Elixir, Rust, Java, .NET, Elm and Go. In Dependabot-Core from version 0.119.0.beta1 before version 0.125.1, there is a remote code execution vulnerability in dependabot-common and dependabot-go_modules when a source branch name contains malicious injectable bash code. For example, if Dependabot is configured to use the following source branch name: \"/$({curl,127.0.0.1})\", Dependabot will make a HTTP request to the following URL: 127.0.0.1 when cloning the source repository. The fix was applied to version 0.125.1. As a workaround, one can escape the branch name prior to passing it to the Dependabot::Source class.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26222", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDependabot Project\u00bbDependabotVersions  from including (>=) 0.119.1andbefore (<) 0.125.1cpe:2.3:a:dependabot_project:dependabot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDependabot Project\u00bbDependabot\u00bbVersion:0.119.0cpe:2.3:a:dependabot_project:dependabot:0.119.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDependabot Project\u00bbDependabot\u00bbVersion:0.119.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:dependabot_project:dependabot:0.119.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.37%  2.01%  +0.65 \n 2  2024-03-18  1.36%  1.37%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-04-28  1.31%  1.36%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  4.57%  1.31%  -3.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/commit/e089116abbe284425b976f7920e502b8e83a61b5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2727 from dependabot/v0.125.1-release-notes \u00b7 dependabot/dependabot-core@e089116 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/2727", "ref_desc": "v0.125.1 by feelepxyz \u00b7 Pull Request #2727 \u00b7 dependabot/dependabot-core \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/security/advisories/GHSA-23f7-99jx-m54r", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution in dependabot-core branch names when cloning \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dependabot/dependabot-core \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
