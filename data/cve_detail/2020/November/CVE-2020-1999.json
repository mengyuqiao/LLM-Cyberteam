{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-1999", "Description": "A vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Network PAN-OS signature-based threat detection engine that allows an attacker to communicate with devices in the network in a way that is not analyzed for threats by sending data through specifically crafted TCP packets. This technique evades signature-based threat detection.
