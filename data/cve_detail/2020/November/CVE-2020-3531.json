{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3531", "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the back-end database of an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly authenticate REST API calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) token and then using the token with REST API requests. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the back-end database of the affected device and read, alter, or drop information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3531", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIot Field Network DirectorVersions  before (<) 4.6.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:iot_field_network_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-05  0.51%  0.49%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-08-04  0.46%  0.51%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.46%  -0.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-FND-BCK-GHkPNZ5F", "ref_desc": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director Unauthenticated REST API VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
