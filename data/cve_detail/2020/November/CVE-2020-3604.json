{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3604", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of certain elements of a Webex recording that is stored in the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3604", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex MeetingsVersions  before (<) 40.6.11cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex MeetingsVersions  from including (>=) 40.7.0andbefore (<) 40.8.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-13  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-11-24  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-07-23  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-06-13  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.06%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-nbr-NOS6FQ24", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/enFD59RiYa742Mabaqj-ZAPiNew.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-1363/", "ref_desc": "ZDI-20-1363 | Zero Day InitiativeThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
