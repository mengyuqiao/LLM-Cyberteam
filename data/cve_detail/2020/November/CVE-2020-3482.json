The vulnerability is due to improper validation of specific connection information by the TURN server within the affected software. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending specially crafted network traffic to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send traffic through the affected software to destinations beyond the application, possibly allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized network access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3482", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Video Communication ServerVersions  before (<) x12.6.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_video_communication_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbExpresswayVersions  before (<) x12.6.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:expressway:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-04  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-06-25  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-Expressway-8J3yZ7hV", "ref_desc": "Cisco Expressway Software Unauthorized Access Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
