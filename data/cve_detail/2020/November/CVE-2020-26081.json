{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26081", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against users on an affected system. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web UI. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information on an affected system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26081", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIot Field Network DirectorVersions  before (<) 4.6.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:iot_field_network_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-22  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-08-04  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-25  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-FND-XSS-NzOPCGEc", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
