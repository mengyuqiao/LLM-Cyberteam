{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27385", "Description": "Incorrect Access Control in the FileEditor (/Admin/Views/FileEditor/) in FlexDotnetCMS before v1.5.11 allows an authenticated remote attacker to read and write to existing files outside the web root. The files can be accessed via directory traversal, i.e., by entering a .. (dot dot) path such as ..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\<file> in the input field of the FileEditor. In FlexDotnetCMS before v1.5.8, it is also possible to access files by specifying the full path (e.g., C:\\<file>). The files can then be edited via the FileEditor.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27385", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nFlexdotnetcms Project\u00bbFlexdotnetcmsVersions  before (<) 1.5.11cpe:2.3:a:flexdotnetcms_project:flexdotnetcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.23%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-07-30  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MacdonaldRobinson/FlexDotnetCMS/releases/tag/v1.5.11", "ref_desc": "Release FlexDotNetCMS v1.5.11 \u00b7 MacdonaldRobinson/FlexDotnetCMS \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.vonahi.io/whats-in-a-re-name/", "ref_desc": "What\u2019s in a name: RCE Hunting in CMSs via Unrestricted File UploadExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/G6cW-EP_OhclB6FNC5rDzYAzF-g.html"}]}
