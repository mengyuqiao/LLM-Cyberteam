{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3556", "Description": "A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a targeted AnyConnect user to execute a malicious script. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication to the IPC listener. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPC messages to the AnyConnect client IPC listener. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the targeted AnyConnect user to execute a script. This script would execute with the privileges of the targeted AnyConnect user. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, there must be an ongoing AnyConnect session by the targeted user at the time of the attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would also need valid user credentials on the system upon which the AnyConnect client is being run. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3556", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAnyconnect Secure Mobility Client\u00bbVersion:4.9(3052)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:4.9\\(3052\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAnyconnect Secure Mobility Client\u00bbVersion:98.145(86)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:98.145\\(86\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-ipc-KfQO9QhK", "ref_desc": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
