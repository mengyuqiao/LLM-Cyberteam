{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3444", "Description": "A vulnerability in the packet filtering features of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass L3 and L4 traffic filters. The vulnerability is due to improper traffic filtering conditions on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious TCP packet with specific characteristics and sending it to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the L3 and L4 traffic filters and inject an arbitrary packet into the network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3444", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  from including (>=) 17.2andup to, including, (<=) 17.2.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 16.12.2rcpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-23  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cedge-filt-bypass-Y6wZMqm4", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN Software Packet Filtering Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
