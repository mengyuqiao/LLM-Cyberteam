{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26214", "Description": "In Alerta before version 8.1.0, users may be able to bypass LDAP authentication if they provide an empty password when Alerta server is configure to use LDAP as the authorization provider. Only deployments where LDAP servers are configured to allow unauthenticated authentication mechanism for anonymous authorization are affected. A fix has been implemented in version 8.1.0 that returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized response for any authentication attempts where the password field is empty. As a workaround LDAP administrators can disallow unauthenticated bind requests by clients.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26214", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAlerta Project\u00bbAlertaVersions  before (<) 7.5.7cpe:2.3:a:alerta_project:alerta:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAlerta Project\u00bbAlertaVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.1.0cpe:2.3:a:alerta_project:alerta:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.78%  3.40%  -2.38 \n 2  2024-10-13  5.11%  5.78%  +0.67 \n 3  2024-09-27  3.67%  5.11%  +1.44 \n 4  2024-08-08  2.62%  3.67%  +1.05 \n 5  2024-07-24  1.87%  2.62%  +0.76 \n 6  2024-07-06  1.32%  1.87%  +0.54 \n 7  2024-04-11  1.55%  1.32%  -0.22 \n 8  2023-10-26  1.26%  1.55%  +0.29 \n 9  2023-07-23  1.37%  1.26%  -0.11 \n 10  2023-06-13  1.31%  1.37%  +0.06 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.11%  1.31%  +0.20 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/alerta/alerta/security/advisories/GHSA-5hmm-x8q8-w5jh", "ref_desc": "LDAP authentication bypass with empty password \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 alerta/alerta \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/alerta/alerta/commit/2bfa31779a4c9df2fa68fa4d0c5c909698c5ef65", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #1345 from alerta/fix-ldap-empty-bind \u00b7 alerta/alerta@2bfa317 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4513#section-5.1.2", "ref_desc": "RFC 4513 - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Authentication Methods and Security MechanismsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/alerta/alerta/pull/1345", "ref_desc": "Do not allow LDAP login with empty password by satterly \u00b7 Pull Request #1345 \u00b7 alerta/alerta \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/alerta-server/8.1.0/", "ref_desc": "alerta-server \u00b7 PyPIThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/alerta/alerta/issues/1277", "ref_desc": "Disallow LDAP anonymous bind \u00b7 Issue #1277 \u00b7 alerta/alerta \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
