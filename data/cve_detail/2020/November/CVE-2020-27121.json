{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27121", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the Cisco XCP Authentication Service on an affected device to restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of login requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted client login request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition for new login attempts. Users who are authenticated at the time of the attack would not be affected. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27121", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager Im And Presence Service\u00bbVersion:12.5(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager_im_and_presence_service:12.5\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-imp-dos-uTx2dqu2", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
