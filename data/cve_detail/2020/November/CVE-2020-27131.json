{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27131", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Java deserialization function that is used by Cisco Security Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious serialized Java object to a specific listener on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with the privileges of NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM on the Windows target host. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27131", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSecurity ManagerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.22cpe:2.3:a:cisco:security_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "90.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  93.24%  90.61%  -2.63 \n 2  2023-10-09  92.98%  93.24%  +0.26 \n 3  2023-08-02  93.24%  92.98%  -0.26 \n 4  2023-06-23  92.16%  93.24%  +1.09 \n 5  2023-05-15  91.00%  92.16%  +1.16 \n 6  2023-04-04  83.79%  91.00%  +7.21 \n 7  2023-03-20  80.89%  83.79%  +2.91 \n 8  2023-03-08  75.11%  80.89%  +5.78 \n 9  2023-03-07  9.03%  75.11%  +66.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-csm-java-rce-mWJEedcD", "ref_desc": "Cisco Security Manager Java Deserialization VulnerabilitiesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
