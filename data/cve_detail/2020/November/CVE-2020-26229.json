{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26229", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In TYPO3 from version 10.4.0, and before version 10.4.10, RSS widgets are susceptible to XML external entity processing. This vulnerability is reasonable, but is theoretical - it was not possible to actually reproduce the vulnerability with current PHP versions of supported and maintained system distributions. At least with libxml2 version 2.9, the processing of XML external entities is disabled per default - and cannot be exploited. Besides that, a valid backend user account is needed. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.10 to fix the problem described.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26229", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.10cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-012", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-012: XML External Entity in Dashboard WidgetVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-q9cp-mc96-m4w2", "ref_desc": "XML External Entity in Dashboard Widget \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
