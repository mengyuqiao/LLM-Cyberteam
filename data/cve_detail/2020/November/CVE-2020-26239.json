{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26239", "Description": "Scratch Addons is a WebExtension that supports both Chrome and Firefox. Scratch Addons before version 1.3.2 is vulnerable to DOM-based XSS. If the victim visited a specific website, the More Links addon of the Scratch Addons extension used incorrect regular expression which caused the HTML-escaped values to be unescaped, leading to XSS. Scratch Addons version 1.3.2 fixes the bug. The extension will be automatically updated by the browser. More Links addon can be disabled via the option of the extension.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26239", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nScratchaddons\u00bbScratch AddonsVersions  before (<) 1.3.2cpe:2.3:a:scratchaddons:scratch_addons:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/security/advisories/GHSA-6qfq-px3r-xj4p", "ref_desc": "DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/commit/b9a52d6532c8514254c7cc1d8e18710dbedc41ff", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Fix DOM XSS in More Links addon \u00b7 ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons@b9a52d6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/releases/tag/v1.3.2", "ref_desc": "Release Scratch Addons v1.3.2 \u00b7 ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/blob/a471893df403f86c9182970678175d4772a0690c/addons/more-links/userscript.js#L15", "ref_desc": "ScratchAddons/userscript.js at a471893df403f86c9182970678175d4772a0690c \u00b7 ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
