{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8276", "Description": "The implementation of Brave Desktop's privacy-preserving analytics system (P3A) between 1.1 and 1.18.35 logged the timestamp of when the user last opened an incognito window, including Tor windows. The intended behavior was to log the timestamp for incognito windows excluding Tor windows. Note that if a user has P3A enabled, the timestamp is not sent to Brave's server, but rather a value from:Used in last 24hUsed in last week but not 24hUsed in last 28 days but not weekEver used but not in last 28 daysNever usedThe privacy risk is low because a local attacker with disk access cannot tell if the timestamp corresponds to a Tor window or a non-Tor incognito window.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8276", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBrave\u00bbBraveVersions  from including (>=) 1.1andup to, including, (<=) 1.18.35cpe:2.3:a:brave:brave:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1024668", "ref_desc": "#1024668 Brave Browser potentially logs the last time a Tor window was usedExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
