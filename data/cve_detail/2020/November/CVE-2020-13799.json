{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13799", "Description": "Western Digital has identified a security vulnerability in the Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) protocol as specified in multiple standards for storage device interfaces, including all versions of eMMC, UFS, and NVMe. The RPMB protocol is specified by industry standards bodies and is implemented by storage devices from multiple vendors to assist host systems in securing trusted firmware. Several scenarios have been identified in which the RPMB state may be affected by an attacker without the knowledge of the trusted component that uses the RPMB feature.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13799", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinaro\u00bbOp-teeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.11.0cpe:2.3:o:linaro:op-tee:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWesterndigital\u00bbInand Cl Em132 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2020-06-03cpe:2.3:o:westerndigital:inand_cl_em132_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Westerndigital\u00bbInand Cl Em132\u00bbVersion:N/A\nWesterndigital\u00bbInand Ix Em132 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2020-06-03cpe:2.3:o:westerndigital:inand_ix_em132_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Westerndigital\u00bbInand Ix Em132\u00bbVersion:N/A\nWesterndigital\u00bbInand Ix Em132 Xi FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2020-06-03cpe:2.3:o:westerndigital:inand_ix_em132_xi_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Westerndigital\u00bbInand Ix Em132 Xi\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-09-22  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-07  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-04  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-05-30  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-20008-replay-attack-vulnerabilities-rpmb-protocol-applications", "ref_desc": "WDC-20008 Replay Attack Vulnerabilities in RPMB Protocol Applications | Western DigitalVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/231329", "ref_desc": "VU#231329 - Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) protocol does not adequately defend against replay attacksThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
