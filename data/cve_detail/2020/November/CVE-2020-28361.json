{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28361", "Description": "Kamailio before 5.4.0, as used in Sip Express Router (SER) in Sippy Softswitch 4.5 through 5.2 and other products, allows a bypass of a header-removal protection mechanism via whitespace characters. This occurs in the remove_hf function in the Kamailio textops module. Particular use of remove_hf in Sippy Softswitch may allow skilled attacker having a valid credential in the system to disrupt internal call start/duration accounting mechanisms leading potentially to a loss of revenue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28361", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKamailio\u00bbKamailioVersions  before (<) 5.4.0cpe:2.3:a:kamailio:kamailio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.24%  +0.18 \n 2  2024-03-06  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.sippysoft.com/support/discussions/topics/3000179616", "ref_desc": "Sign into : Sippy Software, Inc.Permissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159030/Kamailio-5.4.0-Header-Smuggling.html", "ref_desc": "Kamailio 5.4.0 Header Smuggling \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
