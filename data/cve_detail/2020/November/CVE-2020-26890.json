{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26890", "Description": "Matrix Synapse before 1.20.0 erroneously permits non-standard NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity JSON values in fields of m.room.member events, allowing remote attackers to execute a denial of service attack against the federation and common Matrix clients. If such a malformed event is accepted into the room's state, the impact is long-lasting and is not fixed by an upgrade to a newer version, requiring the event to be manually redacted instead. Since events are replicated to servers of other room members, the impact is not constrained to the server of the event sender.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26890", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.20.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.77% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.70%  0.77%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-09-28  0.79%  0.70%  -0.10 \n 3  2024-09-13  0.66%  0.79%  +0.13 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.35%  0.66%  +0.31 \n 5  2023-08-09  0.31%  0.35%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-06-30  0.39%  0.31%  -0.08 \n 7  2023-06-18  0.27%  0.39%  +0.11 \n 8  2023-06-04  0.26%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.26%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G7YXMMYQP46PYL664JQUXCA3LPBJU7DQ/", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U34DPP4ZLOEDUY2ZCWOHQPU5GA5LYNUQ/", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-4mp3-385r-v63f", "ref_desc": "Denial of service attack due to invalid JSON \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
