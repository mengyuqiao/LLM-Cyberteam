{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12926", "Description": "The Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) reference software may not properly track the number of times a failed shutdown happens. This can leave the TPM in a state where confidential key material in the TPM may be able to be compromised. AMD believes that the attack requires physical access of the device because the power must be repeatedly turned on and off. This potential attack may be used to change confidential information, alter executables signed by key material in the TPM, or create a denial of service of the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12926", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nAMD\u00bbTrusted Platform Modules Reference\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:amd:trusted_platform_modules_reference:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-29  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security", "ref_desc": "AMD Product Security | AMDVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oVcFb89WrxNw2gFwZv6ThRLBQ1k.html"}]}
