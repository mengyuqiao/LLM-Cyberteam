{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28896", "Description": "Mutt before 2.0.2 and NeoMutt before 2020-11-20 did not ensure that $ssl_force_tls was processed if an IMAP server's initial server response was invalid. The connection was not properly closed, and the code could continue attempting to authenticate. This could result in authentication credentials being exposed on an unencrypted connection, or to a machine-in-the-middle.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28896", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMutt\u00bbMuttVersions  before (<) 2.0.2cpe:2.3:a:mutt:mutt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNeomutt\u00bbNeomuttVersions  before (<) 2020-11-20cpe:2.3:a:neomutt:neomutt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.49%  0.27%  -0.22 \n 2  2024-10-30  0.43%  0.49%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-10-14  0.30%  0.43%  +0.13 \n 4  2024-09-27  0.31%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-08-09  0.30%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-30  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-04  0.21%  0.29%  +0.09 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.21%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/-/commit/04b06aaa3e0cc0022b9b01dbca2863756ebbf59a", "ref_desc": "Ensure IMAP connection is closed after a connection error.
