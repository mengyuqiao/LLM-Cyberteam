{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13927", "Description": "The previous default setting for Airflow's Experimental API was to allow all API requests without authentication, but this poses security risks to users who miss this fact. From Airflow 1.10.11 the default has been changed to deny all requests by default and is documented at https://airflow.apache.org/docs/1.10.11/security.html#api-authentication. Note this change fixes it for new installs but existing users need to change their config to default `[api]auth_backend = airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all` as mentioned in the Updating Guide: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.10.11/UPDATING.md#experimental-api-will-deny-all-request-by-default", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13927", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbAirflowVersions  before (<) 1.10.11cpe:2.3:a:apache:airflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "94.71% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  96.68%  94.71%  -1.97 \n 2  2024-10-18  96.65%  96.68%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-07-28  96.83%  96.65%  -0.18 \n 4  2024-06-24  96.67%  96.83%  +0.16 \n 5  2024-05-20  96.53%  96.67%  +0.14 \n 6  2024-05-02  96.59%  96.53%  -0.06 \n 7  2024-04-15  96.25%  96.59%  +0.35 \n 8  2024-03-15  96.19%  96.25%  +0.06 \n 9  2024-02-15  97.18%  96.19%  -1.00 \n 10  2024-02-12  97.13%  97.18%  +0.05 \n 11  2024-02-07  96.92%  97.13%  +0.21 \n 12  2024-01-28  96.76%  96.92%  +0.16 \n 13  2023-10-17  96.71%  96.76%  +0.05 \n 14  2023-10-03  96.62%  96.71%  +0.09 \n 15  2023-09-22  96.94%  96.62%  -0.32 \n 16  2023-09-20  94.93%  96.94%  +2.01 \n 17  2023-09-19  94.56%  94.93%  +0.37 \n 18  2023-09-06  95.40%  94.56%  -0.85 \n 19  2023-08-22  94.75%  95.40%  +0.65 \n 20  2023-07-27  94.32%  94.75%  +0.43 \n 21  2023-07-01  95.02%  94.32%  -0.69 \n 22  2023-06-17  95.25%  95.02%  -0.24 \n 23  2023-05-09  95.24%  95.25%  +0.01 \n 24  2023-04-25  95.49%  95.24%  -0.25 \n 25  2023-03-07  16.53%  95.49%  +78.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1056 Invokable Control Element with Variadic Parameters", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1056/Invokable-Control-Element-with-Variadic-Parameters.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1188/Initialization-of-a-Resource-with-an-Insecure-Default.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r23a81b247aa346ff193670be565b2b8ea4b17ddbc7a35fc099c1aadd%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Pony Mail!Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174764/Apache-Airflow-1.10.10-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Airflow 1.10.10 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OI5OuKHjZgWtaCsA_0wHsBPfNec.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162908/Apache-Airflow-1.10.10-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Airflow 1.10.10 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pYIDtXm30ZJlCFd_oTrYsFcbeNA.html"}]}
