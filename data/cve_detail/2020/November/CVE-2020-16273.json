{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-16273", "Description": "In Arm software implementing the Armv8-M processors (all versions), the stack selection mechanism could be influenced by a stack-underflow attack in v8-M TrustZone based processors. An attacker can cause a change to the stack pointer used by the Secure World from a non-secure application if the stack is not initialized. This vulnerability affects only the software that is based on Armv8-M processors with the Security Extension.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-16273", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nARM\u00bbArmv8-m Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:arm:armv8-m_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:ARM\u00bbArmv8-m\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/armv8-m-stack-sealing", "ref_desc": "Armv8-M Stack Sealing vulnerability \u2013 Arm DeveloperVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
