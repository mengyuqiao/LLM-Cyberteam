{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12496", "Description": "Endress+Hauser Ecograph T (Neutral/Private Label) (RSG35, ORSG35) and Memograph M (Neutral/Private Label) (RSG45, ORSG45) with Firmware version V2.0.0 and above is prone to exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. The firmware release has a dynamic token for each request submitted to the server, which makes repeating requests and analysis complex enough. Nevertheless, it's possible and during the analysis it was discovered that it also has an issue with the access-control matrix on the server-side. It was found that a user with low rights can get information from endpoints that should not be available to this user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12496", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nEndress\u00bbRsg35 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:o:endress:rsg35_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Endress\u00bbRsg35\u00bbVersion:N/A\nEndress\u00bbRsg45 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:o:endress:rsg45_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Endress\u00bbRsg45\u00bbVersion:N/A\nEndress\u00bbOrsg35 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:o:endress:orsg35_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Endress\u00bbOrsg35\u00bbVersion:N/A\nEndress\u00bbOrsg45 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:o:endress:orsg45_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Endress\u00bbOrsg45\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2020-022", "ref_desc": "ENDRESS+HAUSER: Ecograph T utilizing Webserver firmware version 2.x \u2014 English (USA)Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
