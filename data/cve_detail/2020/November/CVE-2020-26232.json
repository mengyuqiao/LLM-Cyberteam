{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26232", "Description": "Jupyter Server before version 1.0.6 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website. All jupyter servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26232", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbJupyter ServerVersions  before (<) 1.0.6cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyter_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/3d83e49090289c431da253e2bdb8dc479cbcb157", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-grfj-wjv9-4f9v \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server@3d83e49 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#106---2020-11-18", "ref_desc": "jupyter_server/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-grfj-wjv9-4f9v", "ref_desc": "Open redirect vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
