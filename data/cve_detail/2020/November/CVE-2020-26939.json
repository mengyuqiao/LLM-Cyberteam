{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26939", "Description": "In Legion of the Bouncy Castle BC before 1.61 and BC-FJA before 1.0.1.2, attackers can obtain sensitive information about a private exponent because of Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs. This occurs in org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding. Sending invalid ciphertext that decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially leaking some information about the private exponent of the RSA private key performing the encryption.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26939", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBouncycastle\u00bbLegion-of-the-bouncy-castleVersions  before (<) 1.61cpe:2.3:a:bouncycastle:legion-of-the-bouncy-castle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBouncycastle\u00bbLegion-of-the-bouncy-castle-fips-java-apiVersions  before (<) 1.0.1.2cpe:2.3:a:bouncycastle:legion-of-the-bouncy-castle-fips-java-api:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-19  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-09  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/wiki/CVE-2020-26939", "ref_desc": "CVE 2020 26939 \u00b7 bcgit/bc-java Wiki \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8c36ba34e80e05eecb1f80071cc834d705616f315b634ec0c7d8f42e@%3Cissues.solr.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Pony Mail!Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JcFvIEi3f_PeBSQr8ie4fY5bSug.html"}]}
