{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27484", "Description": "Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Integer Overflow. The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter fails to check for overflow when allocating the array for the NEWA instruction. This a constrained read/write primitive across the entire MAX32630 address space. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application execution environment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27484", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGarmin\u00bbForerunner 235 FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 7.90andbefore (<) 8.20cpe:2.3:o:garmin:forerunner_235_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Garmin\u00bbForerunner 235\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.24%  +0.09 \n 2  2023-10-09  0.16%  0.15%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.16%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2020-0004.md", "ref_desc": "advisories/ATREDIS-2020-0004.md at master \u00b7 atredispartners/advisories \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
