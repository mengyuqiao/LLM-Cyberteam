{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26237", "Description": "Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. Highlight.js versions before 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A malicious HTML code block can be crafted that will result in prototype pollution of the base object's prototype during highlighting. If you allow users to insert custom HTML code blocks into your page/app via parsing Markdown code blocks (or similar) and do not filter the language names the user can provide you may be vulnerable. The pollution should just be harmless data but this can cause problems for applications not expecting these properties to exist and can result in strange behavior or application crashes, i.e. a potential DOS vector. If your website or application does not render user provided data it should be unaffected. Versions 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 and newer include fixes for this vulnerability. If you are using version 7 or 8 you are encouraged to upgrade to a newer release.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26237", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOracle\u00bbMysql Enterprise MonitorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 8.0.30cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql_enterprise_monitor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHighlightjs\u00bbHighlight.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 9.18.2cpe:2.3:a:highlightjs:highlight.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nHighlightjs\u00bbHighlight.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 10.1.0andbefore (<) 10.1.2cpe:2.3:a:highlightjs:highlight.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.24%  -0.10 \n 2  2023-12-28  0.29%  0.34%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-12-12  0.20%  0.29%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.20%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-471 Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/471/Modification-of-Assumed-Immutable-Data-MAID-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/commit/7241013ae011a585983e176ddc0489a7a52f6bb0", "ref_desc": "(parser) use null prototype objects for languages/aliases (#2636) \u00b7 highlightjs/highlight.js@7241013 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/highlight.js", "ref_desc": "highlight.js - npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/security/advisories/GHSA-vfrc-7r7c-w9mx", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 highlightjs/highlight.js \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/pull/2636", "ref_desc": "use null prototype objects for languages/aliases by night \u00b7 Pull Request #2636 \u00b7 highlightjs/highlight.js \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/12/msg00041.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2511-1] highlight.js security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/z0T4vZZMJxuRWtccNkz5b23_D-0.html"}]}
