{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27485", "Description": "Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Array index error. The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter fails to check the index provided when accessing the local variable in the LGETV and LPUTV instructions. This provides the ability to both read and write memory outside the bounds of the TVM context allocation. It can be leveraged to construct a use-after-free scenario, leading to a constrained read/write primitive across the entire MAX32630 address space. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application execution environment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27485", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGarmin\u00bbForerunner 235 FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 7.90andbefore (<) 8.20cpe:2.3:o:garmin:forerunner_235_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Garmin\u00bbForerunner 235\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.20%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-03-21  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-09  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.13%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/129/Improper-Validation-of-Array-Index.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2020-0005.md", "ref_desc": "advisories/ATREDIS-2020-0005.md at master \u00b7 atredispartners/advisories \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
