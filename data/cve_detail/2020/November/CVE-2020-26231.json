{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26231", "Description": "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. A bypass of CVE-2020-15247 (fixed in 1.0.469 and 1.1.0) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) and v1.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26231", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctober\u00bbVersion:1.0.469cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:1.0.469:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOctobercms\u00bbOctober\u00bbVersion:1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 \n 2  2023-02-22  1.40%  0.89%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-r89v-cgv7-3jhx", "ref_desc": "Bypass of fix for CVE-2020-15247, Twig sandbox escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/d34fb8ab51108495a9a651b841202d935f4e12f7", "ref_desc": "Improve Twig security policy \u00b7 octobercms/october@d34fb8a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
