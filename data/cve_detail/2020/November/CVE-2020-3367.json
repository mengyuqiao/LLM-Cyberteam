{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3367", "Description": "A vulnerability in the log subscription subsystem of Cisco AsyncOS for the Cisco Secure Web Appliance (formerly Web Security Appliance) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command injection and elevate privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for the web interface and CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and injecting scripting commands in the scope of the log subscription subsystem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3367", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 12.5.0andbefore (<) 12.5.1-011cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andbefore (<) 12.0.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 11.8.0andbefore (<) 11.8.2-009cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  before (<) 11.7.2-011cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.04%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wsa-prv-esc-nPzWZrQj", "ref_desc": "Cisco Secure Web Appliance Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
