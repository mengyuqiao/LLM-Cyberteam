{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28942", "Description": "An issue exists in PrimeKey EJBCA before 7.4.3 when enrolling with EST while proxied through an RA over the Peers protocol. As a part of EJBCA's domain security model, the peer connector allows the restriction of client certificates (for the RA, not the end user) to a limited set of allowed CAs, thus restricting the accessibility of that RA to the rights it has within a specific role. While this works for other protocols such as CMP, it was found that the EJBCA enrollment over an EST implementation bypasses this check, allowing enrollment with a valid client certificate through any functioning and authenticated RA connected to the CA. NOTE: an attacker must already have a trusted client certificate and authorization to enroll against the targeted CA.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28942", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPrimekey\u00bbEjbca\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 7.4.3cpe:2.3:a:primekey:ejbca:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.primekey.com/news/posts/40", "ref_desc": "EJBCA Security Advisory - Domain Security over EST - News / PrimeKey Announcements - PrimeKey SupportVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
