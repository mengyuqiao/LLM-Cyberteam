{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28331", "Description": "Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W devices have Improper Access Control. Affected Version(s): 2.5.1.8. The Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W device has an SSH daemon included in the firmware image. By default, the SSH daemon is disabled and does not start at system boot. The system initialization scripts read a device configuration file variable to see if the SSH daemon should be started. The web interface does not provide a visible capability to alter this configuration file variable. However, a malicious actor can include this variable in a POST such that the SSH daemon will be started when the device boots.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28331", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBarco\u00bbWepresent Wipg-1600w Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.5.1.8cpe:2.3:o:barco:wepresent_wipg-1600w_firmware:2.5.1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Barco\u00bbWepresent Wipg-1600w\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-07-01  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160162/Barco-wePresent-Undocumented-SSH-Interface.html", "ref_desc": "Barco wePresent Undocumented SSH Interface \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-007.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
