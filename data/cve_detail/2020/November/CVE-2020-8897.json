{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8897", "Description": "A weak robustness vulnerability exists in the AWS Encryption SDKs for Java, Python, C and Javalcript prior to versions 2.0.0. Due to the non-committing property of AES-GCM (and other AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM-SIV or (X)ChaCha20Poly1305) used by the SDKs to encrypt messages, an attacker can craft a unique cyphertext which will decrypt to multiple different results, and becomes especially relevant in a multi-recipient setting. We recommend users update their SDK to 2.0.0 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8897", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbAws Encryption SdkVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:aws_encryption_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-03-21  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-09  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-310", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/310/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/improved-client-side-encryption-explicit-keyids-and-key-commitment/", "ref_desc": "Improved client-side encryption: Explicit KeyIds and key commitment | AWS Security BlogVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-wqgp-vphw-hphf", "ref_desc": "AWS: In-band protocol negotiation and robustness weaknesses in AWS KMS and Encryption SDKs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 google/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
