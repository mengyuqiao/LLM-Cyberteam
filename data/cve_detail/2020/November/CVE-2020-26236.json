{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26236", "Description": "In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26236", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nScratchverifier\u00bbScratchverifierVersions  before (<) a603769cpe:2.3:a:scratchverifier:scratchverifier:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.19%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-08-06  0.21%  0.21%  0.00 \n 3  2023-06-27  0.21%  0.21%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ScratchVerifier/ScratchVerifier/security/advisories/GHSA-99cr-hvf7-85g9", "ref_desc": "Verification Code Hijacking \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ScratchVerifier/ScratchVerifier \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ScratchVerifier/ScratchVerifier/commit/a603769010abf8c1bede91af46e4945314e4aa4a", "ref_desc": "Change behavior of PUT /verify/{} \u00b7 ScratchVerifier/ScratchVerifier@a603769 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
