{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28333", "Description": "Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W devices allow Authentication Bypass. Affected Version(s): 2.5.1.8. The Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W web interface does not use session cookies for tracking authenticated sessions. Instead, the web interface uses a \"SEID\" token that is appended to the end of URLs in GET requests. Thus the \"SEID\" would be exposed in web proxy logs and browser history. An attacker that is able to capture the \"SEID\" and originate requests from the same IP address (via a NAT device or web proxy) would be able to access the user interface of the device without having to know the credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28333", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nBarco\u00bbWepresent Wipg-1600w Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.5.1.8cpe:2.3:o:barco:wepresent_wipg-1600w_firmware:2.5.1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Barco\u00bbWepresent Wipg-1600w\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-13  0.33%  0.42%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-07-01  0.26%  0.33%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.26%  -0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160161/Barco-wePresent-Authentication-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "Barco wePresent Authentication Bypass \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-006.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
