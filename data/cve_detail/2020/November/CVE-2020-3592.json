{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3592", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and modify the configuration of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checking on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privileges beyond what would normally be authorized for their configured user authorization level. This could allow the attacker to modify the configuration of an affected system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3592", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan VmanageVersions  up to, including, (<=) 20.1.12cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan_vmanage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCatalyst Sd-wan Manager\u00bbVersion:20.3.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:catalyst_sd-wan_manager:20.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanuafw-ZHkdGGEy", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Authorization Bypass VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
