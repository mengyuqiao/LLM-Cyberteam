{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7777", "Description": "This affects all versions of package jsen. If an attacker can control the schema file, it could run arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim machine. In the module description and README file there is no mention about the risks of untrusted schema files, so I assume that this is applicable. In particular the required field of the schema is not properly sanitized. The resulting string that is build based on the schema definition is then passed to a Function.apply();, leading to an Arbitrary Code Execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7777", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJsen Project\u00bbJsen\u00bbForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:jsen_project:jsen:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-03-28  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-16  0.16%  0.15%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.16%  -1.28 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JSEN-1014670", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary Code Execution in jsen | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bugventure/jsen/blob/master/lib/jsen.js%23L875", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
