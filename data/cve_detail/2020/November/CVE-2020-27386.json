{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27386", "Description": "An unrestricted file upload issue in FlexDotnetCMS before v1.5.9 allows an authenticated remote attacker to upload and execute arbitrary files by using the FileManager to upload malicious code (e.g., ASP code) in the form of a safe file type (e.g., a TXT file), and then using the FileEditor (in v1.5.8 and prior) or the FileManager's rename function (in v1.5.7 and prior) to rename the file to an executable extension (e.g., ASP), and finally executing the file via an HTTP GET request to /<path_to_file>.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27386", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFlexdotnetcms Project\u00bbFlexdotnetcmsVersions  before (<) 1.5.9cpe:2.3:a:flexdotnetcms_project:flexdotnetcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "20.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  39.00%  20.47%  -18.53 \n 2  2024-11-05  34.26%  39.00%  +4.74 \n 3  2024-10-19  38.27%  34.26%  -4.01 \n 4  2024-09-16  27.53%  38.27%  +10.75 \n 5  2024-07-30  24.87%  27.53%  +2.65 \n 6  2024-07-12  24.25%  24.87%  +0.62 \n 7  2024-06-09  25.16%  24.25%  -0.91 \n 8  2024-05-22  23.60%  25.16%  +1.57 \n 9  2024-05-04  23.87%  23.60%  -0.28 \n 10  2024-04-17  25.60%  23.87%  -1.73 \n 11  2024-03-17  23.48%  25.60%  +2.12 \n 12  2024-02-14  29.54%  23.48%  -6.05 \n 13  2024-01-30  31.18%  29.54%  -1.65 \n 14  2023-12-30  30.21%  31.18%  +0.97 \n 15  2023-12-16  32.46%  30.21%  -2.24 \n 16  2023-11-16  37.34%  32.46%  -4.88 \n 17  2023-10-19  40.68%  37.34%  -3.35 \n 18  2023-10-05  37.80%  40.68%  +2.88 \n 19  2023-08-24  34.21%  37.80%  +3.59 \n 20  2023-08-12  32.15%  34.21%  +2.06 \n 21  2023-07-16  27.75%  32.15%  +4.40 \n 22  2023-06-07  34.07%  27.75%  -6.32 \n 23  2023-05-08  18.51%  34.07%  +15.56 \n 24  2023-03-07  21.04%  18.51%  -2.53 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MacdonaldRobinson/FlexDotnetCMS/releases/tag/v1.5.9", "ref_desc": "Release FlexDotNetCMS v1.5.9 \u00b7 MacdonaldRobinson/FlexDotnetCMS \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.vonahi.io/whats-in-a-re-name/", "ref_desc": "What\u2019s in a name: RCE Hunting in CMSs via Unrestricted File UploadExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/G6cW-EP_OhclB6FNC5rDzYAzF-g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/14339", "ref_desc": "Add flexdotnetcms v1.5.8 exploit module and docs by kalba-security \u00b7 Pull Request #14339 \u00b7 rapid7/metasploit-framework \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160411/FlexDotnetCMS-1.5.8-Arbitrary-ASP-File-Upload.html", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
