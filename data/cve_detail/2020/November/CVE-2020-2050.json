{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-2050", "Description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the GlobalProtect SSL VPN component of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that allows an attacker to bypass all client certificate checks with an invalid certificate. A remote attacker can successfully authenticate as any user and gain access to restricted VPN network resources when the gateway or portal is configured to rely entirely on certificate-based authentication. Impacted features that use SSL VPN with client certificate verification are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN In configurations where client certificate verification is used in conjunction with other authentication methods, the protections added by the certificate check are ignored as a result of this issue. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.17; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.11; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2050", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.0.1cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.0.11cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 8.1.0andbefore (<) 8.1.17cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.0andbefore (<) 9.1.5cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-29  0.24%  0.34%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-08-11  0.24%  0.24%  0.00 \n 3  2023-07-28  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-15  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.22%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2050", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-2050 PAN-OS: Authentication bypass vulnerability in GlobalProtect SSL VPN client certificate verificationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
