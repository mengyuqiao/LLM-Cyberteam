{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28041", "Description": "The SIP ALG implementation on NETGEAR Nighthawk R7000 1.0.9.64_10.2.64 devices allows remote attackers to communicate with arbitrary TCP and UDP services on a victim's intranet machine, if the victim visits an attacker-controlled web site with a modern browser, aka NAT Slipstreaming. This occurs because the ALG takes action based on an IP packet with an initial REGISTER substring in the TCP data, and the correct intranet IP address in the subsequent Via header, without properly considering that connection progress and fragmentation affect the meaning of the packet data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28041", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetgear\u00bbNighthawk R7000 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.0.9.64 10.2.64cpe:2.3:o:netgear:nighthawk_r7000_firmware:1.0.9.64_10.2.64:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Netgear\u00bbNighthawk R7000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "10.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  9.64%  10.25%  +0.61 \n 2  2024-07-19  6.77%  9.64%  +2.87 \n 3  2023-07-17  6.39%  6.77%  +0.38 \n 4  2023-06-07  5.91%  6.39%  +0.48 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.21%  5.91%  +4.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24958281", "ref_desc": "The attack relies on the ALG ignoring the IP fragment offset in the UDP case onl... | Hacker NewsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://samy.pl/slipstream/", "ref_desc": "Samy Kamkar - NAT SlipstreamingExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2020-0024", "ref_desc": "Security AdvisoryThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/samyk/slipstream", "ref_desc": "GitHub - samyk/slipstream: NAT Slipstreaming allows an attacker to remotely access any TCP/UDP services bound to a victim machine, bypassing the victim\u2019s NAT/firewall, just by the victim visiting a weThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24956616", "ref_desc": "It's not smuggling a SIP session request via HTTP headers - even if it didn't lo... | Hacker NewsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
