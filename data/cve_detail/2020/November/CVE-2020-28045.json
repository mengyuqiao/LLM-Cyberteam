{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28045", "Description": "An unsigned-library issue was discovered in ProlinOS through 2.4.161.8859R. This OS requires installed applications and all system binaries to be signed either by the manufacturer or by the Point Of Sale application developer and distributor. The signature is a 2048-byte RSA signature verified in the kernel prior to ELF execution. Shared libraries, however, do not need to be signed, and they are not verified. An attacker may execute a custom binary by compiling it as a shared object and loading it via LD_PRELOAD.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28045", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPAX\u00bbProlinosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.4.161.8859rcpe:2.3:o:pax:prolinos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-03-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.05%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.lsd.cat/g/pax-pwn", "ref_desc": "g/pax-pwn: Vulnerabilities and tools for the PAX Payment Devices, including D200, S80, S300, S800, S900, S920 - GogsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GDc4RuC2Xjts7holBoMucSbz808.html"}]}
