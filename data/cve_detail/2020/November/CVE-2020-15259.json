{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15259", "Description": "ad-ldap-connector's admin panel before version 5.0.13 does not provide csrf protection, which when exploited may result in remote code execution or confidential data loss. CSRF exploits may occur if the user visits a malicious page containing CSRF payload on the same machine that has access to the ad-ldap-connector admin console via a browser. You may be affected if you use the admin console included with ad-ldap-connector versions <=5.0.12. If you do not have ad-ldap-connector admin console enabled or do not visit any other public URL while on the machine it is installed on, you are not affected. The issue is fixed in version 5.0.13.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15259", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAuth0\u00bbAd/ldap Connector\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.0.13cpe:2.3:a:auth0:ad\\/ldap_connector:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-24  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-10-13  0.22%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-23  0.25%  0.22%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-06-13  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-21  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.69%  0.23%  -1.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/ad-ldap-connector/security/advisories/GHSA-vx5q-cp9v-427v", "ref_desc": "ad-ldap-connector admin console vulnerable to CSRF attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 auth0/ad-ldap-connector \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/ad-ldap-connector/commit/8b793631ec5ecacf63ff3ece23231a9e138ae911", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vx5q-cp9v-427v \u00b7 auth0/ad-ldap-connector@8b79363 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
