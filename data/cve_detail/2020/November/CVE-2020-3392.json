{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3392", "Description": "A vulnerability in the API of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly authenticate API calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information on the affected system, including information about the devices that the system manages, without authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3392", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIot Field Network DirectorVersions  before (<) 4.6.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:iot_field_network_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-05  0.35%  0.34%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-22  0.34%  0.35%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-04  0.31%  0.34%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-06-25  0.31%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.31%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-FND-APIA-xZntFS2V", "ref_desc": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director Missing API Authentication VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
