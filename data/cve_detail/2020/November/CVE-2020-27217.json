{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27217", "Description": "In Eclipse Hono version 1.3.0 and 1.4.0 the AMQP protocol adapter does not verify the size of AMQP messages received from devices. In particular, a device may send messages that are bigger than the max-message-size that the protocol adapter has indicated during link establishment. While the AMQP 1.0 protocol explicitly disallows a peer to send such messages, a hand crafted AMQP 1.0 client could exploit this behavior in order to send a message of unlimited size to the adapter, eventually causing the adapter to fail with an out of memory exception.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27217", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbHono\u00bbVersion:1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:hono:1.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbHono\u00bbVersion:1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:hono:1.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-06-20  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=567068", "ref_desc": "567068 \u2013 (CVE-2020-27217) Hono's AMQP adapter does not check/limit incoming message sizeIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
