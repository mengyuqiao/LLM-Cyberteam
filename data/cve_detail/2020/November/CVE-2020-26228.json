{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26228", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In TYPO3 before versions 9.5.23 and 10.4.10 user session identifiers were stored in cleartext - without processing with additional cryptographic hashing algorithms. This vulnerability cannot be exploited directly and occurs in combination with a chained attack - like for instance SQL injection in any other component of the system. Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.23 or 10.4.10 that fix the problem described.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26228", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.23cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.10cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-08-09  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-06-30  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-954j-f27r-cj52", "ref_desc": "Cleartext storage of session identifier \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-011", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-011: Cleartext storage of session identifierVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
