{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26211", "Description": "In BookStack before version 0.30.4, a user with permissions to edit a page could insert JavaScript code through the use of `javascript:` URIs within a link or form which would run, within the context of the current page, when clicked or submitted. Additionally, a user with permissions to edit a page could insert a particular meta tag which could be used to silently redirect users to a alternative location upon visit of a page. Dangerous content may remain in the database but will be removed before being displayed on a page. If you think this could have been exploited the linked advisory provides a SQL query to test. As a workaround without upgrading, page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade although this will not address existing exploitation of this vulnerability. The issue is fixed in BookStack version 0.30.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26211", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBookstackapp\u00bbBookstackVersions  before (<) 0.30.4cpe:2.3:a:bookstackapp:bookstack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.bookstackapp.com/blog/beta-release-v0-30-4/", "ref_desc": "Beta Security Release v0.30.4 \u00b7 BookStackPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/commit/bbd1384acbe7e52c21f89af69f2dc391c95dbf54", "ref_desc": "XSS and redirect fixes with test cases \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack@bbd1384 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-r2cf-8778-3jgp", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting and Redirects Through Page Content \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.30.4", "ref_desc": "Release BookStack Beta v0.30.4 \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VrMQ01IUqRIz4Zr7G3HZa4gWR7A.html"}]}
