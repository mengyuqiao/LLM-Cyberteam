{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26210", "Description": "In BookStack before version 0.30.4, a user with permissions to edit a page could add an attached link which would execute untrusted JavaScript code when clicked by a viewer of the page. Dangerous content may remain in the database after this update. If you think this could have been exploited the linked advisory provides a SQL query to test. As a workaround, page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade although this will not address existing exploitation of this vulnerability. The issue is fixed in version 0.30.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26210", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBookstackapp\u00bbBookstackVersions  before (<) 0.30.4cpe:2.3:a:bookstackapp:bookstack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.18%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-21  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-17  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-03-08  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bookstackapp.com/blog/beta-release-v0-30-4/", "ref_desc": "Beta Security Release v0.30.4 \u00b7 BookStackExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-7p2j-4h6p-cq3h", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting Through Link Attachments \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/commit/349162ea139556b2d25e09e155cec84e21cc9227", "ref_desc": "Prevented possible XSS via link attachments \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack@349162e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.30.4", "ref_desc": "Release BookStack Beta v0.30.4 \u00b7 BookStackApp/BookStack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VrMQ01IUqRIz4Zr7G3HZa4gWR7A.html"}]}
