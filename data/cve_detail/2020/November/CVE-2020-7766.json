{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-7766", "Description": "This affects all versions of package json-ptr. The issue occurs in the set operation (https://flitbit.github.io/json-ptr/classes/_src_pointer_.jsonpointer.htmlset) when the force flag is set to true. The function recursively set the property in the target object, however it does not properly check the key being set, leading to a prototype pollution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7766", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJson-ptr Project\u00bbJson-ptrVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:json-ptr_project:json-ptr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.87%  1.06%  +0.19 \n 2  2024-07-28  0.73%  0.87%  +0.14 \n 3  2024-06-24  0.60%  0.73%  +0.13 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.49%  0.60%  +0.10 \n 5  2023-10-03  0.36%  0.49%  +0.14 \n 6  2023-07-27  0.37%  0.36%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-06-17  0.30%  0.37%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.30%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/blob/master/src/util.ts%23L174", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JSONPTR-1016939", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution in json-ptr | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1038396", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution in org.webjars.npm:json-ptr | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
