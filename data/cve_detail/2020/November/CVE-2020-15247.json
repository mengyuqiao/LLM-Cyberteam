{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15247", "Description": "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.469, an authenticated backend user with the cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15247", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.319andbefore (<) 1.0.469cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 \n 2  2023-02-22  1.40%  0.89%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/4c650bb775ab849e48202a4923bac93bd74f9982", "ref_desc": "Security fixes for v1.0.469 \u00b7 octobercms/october@4c650bb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-94vp-rmqv-5875", "ref_desc": "Twig Sandbox Escape by authenticated users with access to editing CMS templates when safemode is enabled. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
