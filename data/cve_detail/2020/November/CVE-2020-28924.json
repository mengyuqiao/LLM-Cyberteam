{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28924", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Rclone before 1.53.3. Due to the use of a weak random number generator, the password generator has been producing weak passwords with much less entropy than advertised. The suggested passwords depend deterministically on the time the second rclone was started. This limits the entropy of the passwords enormously. These passwords are often used in the crypt backend for encryption of data. It would be possible to make a dictionary of all possible passwords with about 38 million entries per password length. This would make decryption of secret material possible with a plausible amount of effort. NOTE: all passwords generated by affected versions should be changed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28924", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRclone\u00bbRcloneVersions  before (<) 1.53.3cpe:2.3:a:rclone:rclone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.28%  +0.13 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-08-05  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-26  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/331/Insufficient-Entropy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UJIFT24Q6EFXLQZ24AER2QGFFZLMIPCD/", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-14", "ref_desc": "rclone: Weak random number generation (GLSA 202107-14) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4783", "ref_desc": "Rclone generating weak passwords - CVE-2020-28924 \u00b7 Issue #4783 \u00b7 rclone/rclone \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rclone.org/downloads/", "ref_desc": "Rclone downloadsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
