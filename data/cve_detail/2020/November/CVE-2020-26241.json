{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26241", "Description": "Go Ethereum, or \"Geth\", is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol. This is a Consensus vulnerability in Geth before version 1.9.17 which can be used to cause a chain-split where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain. Geth's pre-compiled dataCopy (at 0x00...04) contract did a shallow copy on invocation. An attacker could deploy a contract that writes X to an EVM memory region R, then calls 0x00..04 with R as an argument, then overwrites R to Y, and finally invokes the RETURNDATACOPY opcode. When this contract is invoked, a consensus-compliant node would push X on the EVM stack, whereas Geth would push Y. This is fixed in version 1.9.17.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26241", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEthereum\u00bbGo EthereumVersions  before (<) 1.9.17cpe:2.3:a:ethereum:go_ethereum:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/682/Incorrect-Calculation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-69v6-xc2j-r2jf", "ref_desc": "Shallow copy in the 0x4 precompile could lead to EVM memory corruption \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ethereum/go-ethereum \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/12/geth_security_release/", "ref_desc": "Geth security release | Ethereum Foundation BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YFMuMOkLtU0aj3E8zm6DSXnC7fQ.html"}]}
