{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28914", "Description": "An improper file permissions vulnerability affects Kata Containers prior to 1.11.5. When using a Kubernetes hostPath volume and mounting either a file or directory into a container as readonly, the file/directory is mounted as readOnly inside the container, but is still writable inside the guest. For a container breakout situation, a malicious guest can potentially modify or delete files/directories expected to be read-only.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28914", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKatacontainers\u00bbKata-containersVersions  before (<) 1.11.5cpe:2.3:a:katacontainers:kata-containers:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kata-containers/runtime/pull/3042", "ref_desc": "readonly volume should be bind mounted readonly on the host by bergwolf \u00b7 Pull Request #3042 \u00b7 kata-containers/runtime \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/pull/1062", "ref_desc": "runtime: readonly volume should be bind mounted readonly on the host by bergwolf \u00b7 Pull Request #1062 \u00b7 kata-containers/kata-containers \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kata-containers/runtime/pull/3051", "ref_desc": "Backports: Read-only mount fixes for 1.11 by amshinde \u00b7 Pull Request #3051 \u00b7 kata-containers/runtime \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kata-containers/runtime/releases/tag/1.11.5", "ref_desc": "Release # Release 1.11.5 \u00b7 kata-containers/runtime \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nPAD7bsdW8PnIfcd_S3D0bNstv8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kata-containers/runtime/releases/tag/1.12.0", "ref_desc": "Release # Release 1.12.0 \u00b7 kata-containers/runtime \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U17e2a8fo70X1a9-6npUyr_KX7Q.html"}]}
