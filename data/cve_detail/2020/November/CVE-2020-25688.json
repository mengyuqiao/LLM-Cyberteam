{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25688", "Description": "A flaw was found in rhacm versions before 2.0.5 and before 2.1.0. Two internal service APIs were incorrectly provisioned using a test certificate from the source repository. This would result in all installations using the same certificates. If an attacker could observe network traffic internal to a cluster, they could use the private key to decode API requests that should be protected by TLS sessions, potentially obtaining information they would not otherwise be able to. These certificates are not used for service authentication, so no opportunity for impersonation or active MITM attacks were made possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25688", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbAdvanced Cluster Management For KubernetesVersions  before (<) 2.0.5cpe:2.3:a:redhat:advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1892551", "ref_desc": "1892551 \u2013 (CVE-2020-25688) CVE-2020-25688 rhacm: certificate re-use in grcuiapi and topologyapiIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
