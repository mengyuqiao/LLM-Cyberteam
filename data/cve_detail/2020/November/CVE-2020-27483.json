{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27483", "Description": "Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Array index error. The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter trusts the offset provided for the stack value duplication instruction, DUP. The offset is unchecked and memory prior to the start of the execution stack can be read and treated as a TVM object. A successful exploit could use the vulnerability to leak runtime information such as the heap handle or pointer for a number of TVM context variables. Some reachable values may be controlled enough to forge a TVM object on the stack, leading to possible remote code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27483", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGarmin\u00bbForerunner 235 FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 7.90andbefore (<) 8.20cpe:2.3:o:garmin:forerunner_235_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Garmin\u00bbForerunner 235\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.34%  -0.09 \n 2  2024-09-05  0.37%  0.42%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-08-03  0.27%  0.37%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-03-21  0.26%  0.27%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-01  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.25%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/129/Improper-Validation-of-Array-Index.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2020-0007.md", "ref_desc": "advisories/ATREDIS-2020-0007.md at master \u00b7 atredispartners/advisories \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
