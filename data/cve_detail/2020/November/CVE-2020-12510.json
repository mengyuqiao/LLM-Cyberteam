{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12510", "Description": "The default installation path of the TwinCAT XAR 3.1 software in all versions is underneath C:\\TwinCAT. If the directory does not exist it and further subdirectories are created with permissions which allow every local user to modify the content. The default installation registers TcSysUI.exe for automatic execution upon log in of a user. If a less privileged user has a local account he or she can replace TcSysUI.exe. It will be executed automatically by another user during login. This is also true for users with administrative access. Consequently, a less privileged user can trick a higher privileged user into executing code he or she modified this way. By default Beckhoff\u2019s IPCs are shipped with TwinCAT software installed this way and with just a single local user configured. Thus the vulnerability exists if further less privileged users have been added.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12510", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBeckhoff\u00bbTwincat Extended Automation Runtime\u00bbVersion:3.1cpe:2.3:a:beckhoff:twincat_extended_automation_runtime:3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2020-037", "ref_desc": "Beckhoff: Privilege Escalation through TwinCat System Tray (TcSysUI.exe) \u2014 English (USA)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
