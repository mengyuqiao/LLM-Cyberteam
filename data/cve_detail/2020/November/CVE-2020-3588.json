{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-3588", "Description": "A vulnerability in virtualization channel messaging in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system. This vulnerability occurs when this app is deployed in a virtual desktop environment and using virtual environment optimization. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of messages processed by the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App. A local attacker with limited privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious messages to the affected software by using the virtualization channel interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the underlying operating system configuration, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a targeted user. Note: This vulnerability can be exploited only when Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App is in a virtual desktop environment on a hosted virtual desktop (HVD) and is configured to use the Cisco Webex Meetings virtual desktop plug-in for thin clients.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3588", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 40.8.0andbefore (<) 40.8.9cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 40.6.9cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-vdi-qQrpBwuJ", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
