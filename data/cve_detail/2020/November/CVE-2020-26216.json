{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26216", "Description": "TYPO3 Fluid before versions 2.0.8, 2.1.7, 2.2.4, 2.3.7, 2.4.4, 2.5.11 and 2.6.10 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Three XSS vulnerabilities have been detected in Fluid: 1. TagBasedViewHelper allowed XSS through maliciously crafted additionalAttributes arrays by creating keys with attribute-closing quotes followed by HTML. When rendering such attributes, TagBuilder would not escape the keys. 2. ViewHelpers which used the CompileWithContentArgumentAndRenderStatic trait, and which declared escapeOutput = false, would receive the content argument in unescaped format. 3. Subclasses of AbstractConditionViewHelper would receive the then and else arguments in unescaped format. Update to versions 2.0.8, 2.1.7, 2.2.4, 2.3.7, 2.4.4, 2.5.11 or 2.6.10 of this typo3fluid/fluid package that fix the problem described.
