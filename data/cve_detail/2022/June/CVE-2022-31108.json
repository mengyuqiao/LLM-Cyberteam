{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31108", "Description": "Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is adequately escaped before embedding it in CSS blocks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31108", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMermaid Project\u00bbMermaid\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 9.1.3cpe:2.3:a:mermaid_project:mermaid:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-19  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-09  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-31  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-29  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/commit/0ae1bdb61adff1cd485caff8c62ec6b8ac57b225", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-x3vm-38hw-55wf \u00b7 mermaid-js/mermaid@0ae1bdb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/security/advisories/GHSA-x3vm-38hw-55wf", "ref_desc": "Possible inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph affecting the container HTML \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mermaid-js/mermaid \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
