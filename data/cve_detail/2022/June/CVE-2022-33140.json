{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-33140", "Description": "The optional ShellUserGroupProvider in Apache NiFi 1.10.0 to 1.16.2 and Apache NiFi Registry 0.6.0 to 1.16.2 does not neutralize arguments for group resolution commands, allowing injection of operating system commands on Linux and macOS platforms. The ShellUserGroupProvider is not included in the default configuration. Command injection requires ShellUserGroupProvider to be one of the enabled User Group Providers in the Authorizers configuration. Command injection also requires an authenticated user with elevated privileges. Apache NiFi requires an authenticated user with authorization to modify access policies in order to execute the command. Apache NiFi Registry requires an authenticated user with authorization to read user groups in order to execute the command. The resolution removes command formatting based on user-provided arguments.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33140", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbNifiVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.16.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:nifi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A\nApache\u00bbNifi RegistryVersions  from including (>=) 0.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.16.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:nifi_registry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "6.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  9.13%  6.66%  -2.47 \n 2  2024-12-11  2.66%  9.13%  +6.47 \n 3  2024-11-14  2.61%  2.66%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-10-31  0.23%  2.61%  +2.38 \n 5  2024-10-04  0.16%  0.23%  +0.07 \n 6  2024-08-22  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-06-28  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 8  2024-06-11  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 9  2024-04-17  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 10  2024-02-04  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-11-26  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-07-05  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 13  2023-06-22  0.11%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 14  2023-04-22  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 15  2023-03-07  2.06%  0.10%  -1.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2022-33140", "ref_desc": "Apache NiFi Security ReportsIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/bzs2pcdjsdrh5039oslmfr9mbs9qqdhr", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-33140: Apache NiFi, Apache NiFi Registry: Improper Neutralization of Command Elements in Shell User Group Provider-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
