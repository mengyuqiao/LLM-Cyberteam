{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29948", "Description": "Due to an insecure design, the Lepin EP-KP001 flash drive through KP001_V19 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass attack that enables an attacker to gain access to the stored encrypted data. Normally, the encrypted disk partition with this data is unlocked by entering the correct passcode (6 to 14 digits) via the keypad and pressing the Unlock button. This authentication is performed by an unknown microcontroller. By replacing this microcontroller on a target device with one from an attacker-controlled Lepin EP-KP001 whose passcode is known, it is possible to successfully unlock the target device and read the stored data in cleartext.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29948", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLepin Ep-kp001 Project\u00bbLepinep-kp001 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) kp001_v19cpe:2.3:o:lepin_ep-kp001_project:lepinep-kp001_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Lepin Ep-kp001 Project\u00bbLepin Ep-kp001\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-01-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2022-024.txt", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Jun/27", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2022-024]: Lepin EP-KP001 - Violation of Secure Design Principles (CWE-657) (CVE-2022-29948)Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167550/Lepin-EP-KP001-KP001_V19-Authentication-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "Lepin EP-KP001 KP001_V19 Authentication Bypass \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
