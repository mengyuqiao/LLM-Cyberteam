{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31004", "Description": "CVEProject/cve-services is an open source project used to operate the CVE services API. A conditional in 'data.js' has potential for production secrets to be written to disk. The affected method writes the generated randomKey to disk if the environment is not development. If this method were called in production, it is possible that it would write the plaintext key to disk. A patch is not available as of time of publication but is anticipated as a \"hot fix\" for version 1.1.1 and for the 2.x branch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31004", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMitre\u00bbCve-servicesVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:mitre:cve-services:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.30%  +0.08 \n 2  2023-12-16  0.19%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-05  0.18%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-27  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-01  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-04-25  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-779 Logging of Excessive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/779/Logging-of-Excessive-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/blob/6b085e481fd3b084a8828ef7489c6b82fa415c92/src/utils/data.js#L68-L83", "ref_desc": "cve-services/data.js at 6b085e481fd3b084a8828ef7489c6b82fa415c92 \u00b7 CVEProject/cve-services \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/security/advisories/GHSA-mpwm-rmqp-7629", "ref_desc": "Potential secrets being logged to disk (2) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CVEProject/cve-services \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
