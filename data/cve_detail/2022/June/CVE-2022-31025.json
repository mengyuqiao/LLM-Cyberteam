{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31025", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 2.8.4 on the `stable` branch and 2.9.0beta5 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, inviting users on sites that use single sign-on could bypass the `must_approve_users` check and invites by staff are always approved automatically. The issue is patched in Discourse version 2.8.4 on the `stable` branch and version `2.9.0.beta5` on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, disable invites or increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31025", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta4cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-12  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-12-25  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2023-11-14  0.08%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-10  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16974", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Remove auto approval when redeeming an invite by gschlager \u00b7 Pull Request #16974 \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16984", "ref_desc": "FIX: Approves user when redeeming an invite for invites only sites by tgxworld \u00b7 Pull Request #16984 \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/7c4e2d33fa4b922354c177ffc880a2f2701a91f9", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Remove auto approval when redeeming an invite (#16974) \u00b7 discourse/discourse@7c4e2d3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-x7jh-mx5q-6f9q", "ref_desc": "Invite bypasses user approval \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/0fa0094531efc82d9371f90a02aa804b176d59cf", "ref_desc": "FIX: Approves user when redeeming an invite for invites only sites (#\u2026 \u00b7 discourse/discourse@0fa0094 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
