{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24848", "Description": "DHIS2 is an information system for data capture, management, validation, analytics and visualization. A SQL injection security vulnerability affects the `/api/programs/orgUnits?programs=` API endpoint in DHIS2 versions prior to 2.36.10.1 and 2.37.6.1. The system is vulnerable to attack only from users that are logged in to DHIS2, and there is no known way of exploiting the vulnerability without first being logged in as a DHIS2 user. The vulnerability is not exposed to a non-malicious user and requires a conscious attack to be exploited. A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow the malicious user to read, edit and delete data in the DHIS2 instance's database. Security patches are now available for DHIS2 versions 2.36.10.1 and 2.37.6.1. One may apply mitigations at the web proxy level as a workaround. More information about these mitigations is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24848", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  before (<) 2.36.10.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.37.0andbefore (<) 2.37.6.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.36%  +0.11 \n 2  2023-12-23  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-21  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-06-08  0.09%  0.17%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-05-02  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/security/advisories/GHSA-52vp-f7hj-cj92", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') in OrgUnit program association \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-core \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/commit/3b245d04a58b78f0dc9bae8559f36ee4ca36dfac", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-52vp-f7hj-cj92 \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-core@3b245d0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/commit/ef04483a9b177d62e48dcf4e498b302a11f95e7d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-52vp-f7hj-cj92 \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-core@ef04483 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/pull/10953", "ref_desc": "fix: Merge pull request from GHSA-52vp-f7hj-cj92 by ameenhere \u00b7 Pull Request #10953 \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-core \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
