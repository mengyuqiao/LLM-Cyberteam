{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26477", "Description": "The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for loop in the readExternal method is a controllable variable, which, if tampered with, may lead to CPU exhaustion. As a fix, we added an upper bound and termination condition in the read and write logic. We classify it as a \"low-priority but useful improvement\". SystemDS is a distributed system and needs to serialize/deserialize data but in many code paths (e.g., on Spark broadcast/shuffle or writing to sequence files) the byte stream is anyway protected by additional CRC fingerprints. In this particular case though, the number of decoders is upper-bounded by twice the number of columns, which means an attacker would need to modify two entries in the byte stream in a consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness was strictly improved with almost zero overhead. These code changes are available in versions higher than 2.2.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26477", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSystemdsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:systemds:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-26  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-23  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-06-11  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-13  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 6  2024-01-18  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 7  2023-07-30  0.17%  0.12%  -0.04 \n 8  2023-07-04  0.06%  0.17%  +0.10 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/r4x2d2r6d4zykdrrx6s2l4qbxgzws0z3", "ref_desc": "[ANNOUNCE] Minor Security Issue in SystemDS 2.2.1-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220812-0003/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-26477 Systemd Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
