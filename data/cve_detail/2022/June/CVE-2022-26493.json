{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26493", "Description": "Xecurify's miniOrange Premium, Standard, and Enterprise Drupal SAML SP modules possess an authentication and authorization bypass vulnerability. An attacker with access to a HTTP-request intercepting method is able to bypass authentication and authorization by removing the SAML Assertion Signature - impersonating existing users and existing roles, including administrative users/roles. This vulnerability is not mitigated by configuring the module to enforce signatures or certificate checks. Xecurify recommends updating miniOrange modules to their most recent versions. This vulnerability is present in paid versions of the miniOrange Drupal SAML SP product affecting Drupal 7, 8, and 9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26493", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDrupal\u00bbSaml Sp 2.0 Single Sign OnVersions  from including (>=) 8.xandup to, including, (<=) 8.x-2.24cpe:2.3:a:drupal:saml_sp_2.0_single_sign_on:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbSaml Sp 2.0 Single Sign OnVersions  from including (>=) 7.xandup to, including, (<=) 7.x-2.57cpe:2.3:a:drupal:saml_sp_2.0_single_sign_on:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-25  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-14  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-10  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-05-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://rafarmerjr1.github.io/2022/06/13/SAML-miniOrange.html", "ref_desc": "Auth Bypass via SAML Attacks | arf-sec", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
