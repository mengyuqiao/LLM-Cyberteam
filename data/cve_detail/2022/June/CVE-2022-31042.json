{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31042", "Description": "Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions the `Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31042", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 9.3.0andbefore (<) 9.3.16cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 9.2.0andbefore (<) 9.2.21cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupal\u00bbVersion:9.4.0UpdateAlpha1cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:9.4.0:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupal\u00bbVersion:9.4.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:9.4.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupal\u00bbVersion:9.4.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:9.4.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGuzzlephp\u00bbGuzzleVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.4.4cpe:2.3:a:guzzlephp:guzzle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGuzzlephp\u00bbGuzzleVersions  before (<) 6.5.7cpe:2.3:a:guzzlephp:guzzle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-18  0.23%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.45%  0.23%  -0.22 \n 3  2024-08-31  0.22%  0.45%  +0.23 \n 4  2023-12-31  0.23%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-11-20  0.17%  0.23%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-09-14  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-06-16  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-05-10  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/212/Improper-Removal-of-Sensitive-Information-Before-Storage-or-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-redirection-3xx", "ref_desc": "RFC 9110: HTTP SemanticsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2UpJqNhd7TDCnQCkJ68e7HqVdkw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2022-011", "ref_desc": "Drupal core - Moderately critical - Third-party libraries - SA-CORE-2022-011 | Drupal.orgPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gk6yuaekfOwi98eUJtnbQUxPu9E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5246", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5246-1 mediawikiThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IZHp6HJTA1DqTLgSaEtESdWEbxY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/commit/e3ff079b22820c2029d4c2a87796b6a0b8716ad8", "ref_desc": "Release 7.4.4 (#3023) \u00b7 guzzle/guzzle@e3ff079 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xfOyHMLeEtGxSUrlveANicK71lM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/security/advisories/GHSA-f2wf-25xc-69c9", "ref_desc": "Failure to strip the Cookie header on change in host or HTTP downgrade \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 guzzle/guzzle \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
