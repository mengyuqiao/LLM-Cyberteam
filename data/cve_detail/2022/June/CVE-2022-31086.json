{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31086", "Description": "LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 incorrect regular expressions allow to upload PHP scripts to config/templates/pdf. This vulnerability could lead to a Remote Code Execution if the /config/templates/pdf/ directory is accessible for remote users. This is not a default configuration of LAM. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31086", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLdap-account-manager\u00bbLdap Account ManagerVersions  before (<) 8.0cpe:2.3:a:ldap-account-manager:ldap_account_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.05%  1.19%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-12-09  1.02%  1.05%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-18  0.72%  1.02%  +0.30 \n 4  2024-04-15  0.68%  0.72%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-02-16  0.48%  0.68%  +0.20 \n 6  2024-02-02  0.46%  0.48%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-01-18  0.40%  0.46%  +0.06 \n 8  2023-09-19  0.38%  0.40%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-07-30  0.34%  0.38%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-07-04  0.20%  0.34%  +0.14 \n 11  2023-06-23  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-05-28  0.19%  0.18%  0.00 \n 13  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.19%  -4.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-q9pc-x84w-982x", "ref_desc": "Incorrect Regular Expressions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5177", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5177-1 ldap-account-managerThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q8aigTGowKHLjKYpFXXPBDg6CCE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/f1d5d04952f39a1b4ea203d3964fa88e1429dfd4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-r387-grjx-qgvw \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam@f1d5d04 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U7mdSv4dI2ymVhrQ64rfA-7XJ0Q.html"}]}
