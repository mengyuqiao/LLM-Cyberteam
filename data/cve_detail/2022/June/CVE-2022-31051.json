{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31051", "Description": "semantic-release is an open source npm package for automated version management and package publishing. In affected versions secrets that would normally be masked by semantic-release can be accidentally disclosed if they contain characters that are excluded from uri encoding by `encodeURI`. Occurrence is further limited to execution contexts where push access to the related repository is not available without modifying the repository url to inject credentials. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that secrets that do not contain characters that are excluded from encoding with `encodeURI` when included in a URL are already masked properly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31051", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSemantic-release Project\u00bbSemantic-releaseVersions  from including (>=) 17.0.4andbefore (<) 19.0.3cpe:2.3:a:semantic-release_project:semantic-release:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-18  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.15%  -0.07 \n 3  2024-12-05  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-28  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-27  0.20%  0.21%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-01-29  0.14%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-12-31  0.16%  0.14%  -0.02 \n 8  2023-11-20  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-07-12  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-06-16  0.11%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 11  2023-05-10  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.09%  -2.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/security/advisories/GHSA-x2pg-mjhr-2m5x", "ref_desc": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in semantic-release \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 semantic-release/semantic-release \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/releases/tag/v19.0.3", "ref_desc": "Release v19.0.3 \u00b7 semantic-release/semantic-release \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI", "ref_desc": "encodeURI() - JavaScript | MDNThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/58a226f29c04ee56bbb02cc661f020d568849cad", "ref_desc": "fix(log-repo): use the original form of the repo url to remove the ne\u2026 \u00b7 semantic-release/semantic-release@58a226f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
