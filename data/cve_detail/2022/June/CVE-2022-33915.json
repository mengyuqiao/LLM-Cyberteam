{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-33915", "Description": "Versions of the Amazon AWS Apache Log4j hotpatch package before log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch-1.3.5 are affected by a race condition that could lead to a local privilege escalation. This Hotpatch package is not a replacement for updating to a log4j version that mitigates CVE-2021-44228 or CVE-2021-45046; it provides a temporary mitigation to CVE-2021-44228 by hotpatching the local Java virtual machines. To do so, it iterates through all running Java processes, performs several checks, and executes the Java virtual machine with the same permissions and capabilities as the running process to load the hotpatch. A local user could cause the hotpatch script to execute a binary with elevated privileges by running a custom java process that performs exec() of an SUID binary after the hotpatch has observed the process path and before it has observed its effective user ID.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33915", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbHotpatch\u00bbForLog4jVersions  before (<) 1.3.5cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:*:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2022-1806.html", "ref_desc": "ALAS2-2022-1806Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/ALAS-2022-1601.html", "ref_desc": "ALAS-2022-1601Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
