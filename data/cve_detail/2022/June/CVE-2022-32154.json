{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-32154", "Description": "Dashboards in Splunk Enterprise versions before 9.0 might let an attacker inject risky search commands into a form token when the token is used in a query in a cross-origin request. The result bypasses SPL safeguards for risky commands. See New capabilities can limit access to some custom and potentially risky commands (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/SPLsafeguards#New_capabilities_can_limit_access_to_some_custom_and_potentially_risky_commands) for more information. Note that the attack is browser-based and an attacker cannot exploit it at will.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32154", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSplunk\u00bbSplunk\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 9.0cpe:2.3:a:splunk:splunk:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nSplunk\u00bbSplunk Cloud PlatformVersions  before (<) 8.2.2106cpe:2.3:a:splunk:splunk_cloud_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.34%  +0.07 \n 2  2023-11-26  0.23%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-09-20  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-18  0.21%  0.21%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-06-22  0.11%  0.21%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-05-16  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.09%  -1.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security/announcements/svd-2022-0604.html", "ref_desc": "SVD-2022-0604 | SplunkVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/SPLsafeguards#New_capabilities_can_limit_access_to_some_custom_and_potentially_risky_commands", "ref_desc": "SPL safeguards for risky commands - Splunk DocumentationMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.splunk.com/application/splunk_command_and_scripting_interpreter_risky_spl_mltk/", "ref_desc": "Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky SPL MLTK - Splunk Security ContentMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.splunk.com/application/splunk_command_and_scripting_interpreter_risky_commands/", "ref_desc": "Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky Commands - Splunk Security ContentMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/Updates", "ref_desc": "Security updates - Splunk DocumentationRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vOmsLgf60vw1G0n3xmnG76OUJV4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.splunk.com/application/splunk_command_and_scripting_interpreter_delete_usage/", "ref_desc": "Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Delete Usage - Splunk Security ContentMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
