{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31035", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a `javascript:` link in the UI. When clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the victim's permissions (up to and including admin). The script would be capable of doing anything which is possible in the UI or via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting Kubernetes resources. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: v2.4.1, v2.3.5, v2.2.10 and v2.1.16. There are no completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31035", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 2.1.16cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.2.9cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.2.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-18  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-h4w9-6x78-8vrj", "ref_desc": "External URLs for Deployments can include javascript \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/8bc3ef690de29c68a36f473908774346a44d4038", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-h4w9-6x78-8vrj \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd@8bc3ef6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/external-url/", "ref_desc": "Add external URL - Argo CD - Declarative GitOps CD for KubernetesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
