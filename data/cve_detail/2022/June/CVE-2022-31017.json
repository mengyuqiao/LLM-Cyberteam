{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31017", "Description": "Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Versions 2.1.0 through and including 5.2 are vulnerable to a logic error. A stream configured as private with protected history, where new subscribers should not be allowed to see messages sent before they were subscribed, when edited causes the server to incorrectly send an API event that includes the edited message to all of the stream\u2019s current subscribers. This API event is ignored by official clients, but can be observed by using a modified client or the browser\u2019s developer tools. This bug will be fixed in Zulip Server 5.3. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31017", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulipVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andbefore (<) 5.3cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-571 Expression is Always True", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/571/Expression-is-Always-True.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-m5j3-jp59-6f3q", "ref_desc": "Zulip Server exposes edit events for old messages to new subscribers in protected-history streams \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
