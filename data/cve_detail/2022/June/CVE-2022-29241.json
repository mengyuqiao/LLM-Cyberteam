{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29241", "Description": "Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter Notebook. Prior to version 1.17.1, if notebook server is started with a value of `root_dir` that contains the starting user's home directory, then the underlying REST API can be used to leak the access token assigned at start time by guessing/brute forcing the PID of the jupyter server. While this requires an authenticated user session, this URL can be used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised browser to leak this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used along with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as modifying or overwriting critical files, such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious user to read potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system. This issue is patched in version 1.17.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29241", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbJupyter ServerVersions  before (<) 1.17.0cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyter_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-01-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-25  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-21  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-05-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-q874-g24w-4q9g", "ref_desc": "Known or guessable hidden files may be accessed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
