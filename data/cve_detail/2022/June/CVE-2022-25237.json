{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-25237", "Description": "Bonita Web 2021.2 is affected by a authentication/authorization bypass vulnerability due to an overly broad exclude pattern used in the RestAPIAuthorizationFilter. By appending ;i18ntranslation or /../i18ntranslation/ to the end of a URL, users with no privileges can access privileged API endpoints. This can lead to remote code execution by abusing the privileged API actions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25237", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nBonitasoft\u00bbBonita Web\u00bbVersion:2021.2cpe:2.3:a:bonitasoft:bonita_web:2021.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "28.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  35.57%  28.46%  -7.11 \n 2  2024-11-08  34.82%  35.57%  +0.75 \n 3  2024-06-09  49.90%  34.82%  -15.08 \n 4  2024-05-11  63.84%  49.90%  -13.94 \n 5  2024-02-07  31.57%  63.84%  +32.28 \n 6  2023-12-18  36.17%  31.57%  -4.60 \n 7  2023-11-07  36.52%  36.17%  -0.35 \n 8  2023-09-22  68.27%  36.52%  -31.75 \n 9  2023-07-08  68.12%  68.27%  +0.15 \n 10  2023-06-29  76.68%  68.12%  -8.56 \n 11  2023-06-16  80.24%  76.68%  -3.56 \n 12  2023-06-03  85.31%  80.24%  -5.07 \n 13  2023-05-08  86.72%  85.31%  -1.41 \n 14  2023-04-27  88.20%  86.72%  -1.49 \n 15  2023-03-07  1.98%  88.20%  +86.23 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-web", "ref_desc": "GitHub - bonitasoft/bonita-webProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/application-security/cve-2022-25237-bonitasoft-authorization-bypass/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-25237: Bonitasoft Authorization Bypass and RCE - Rhino Security LabsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
