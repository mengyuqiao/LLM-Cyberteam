{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31100", "Description": "rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, rulex may crash, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the expression contains a multi-byte UTF-8 code point in a string literal or after a backslash, because rulex tries to slice into the code point and panics as a result. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the thread running rulex panics. The crashes are fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. The only known workaround for this issue is to assume that regular expression parsing will panic and to add logic to catch panics.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31100", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPomsky-lang\u00bbPomsky\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.4.3cpe:2.3:a:pomsky-lang:pomsky:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-18  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-07-04  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/security/advisories/GHSA-8v9w-p43c-r885", "ref_desc": "Reachable Assertion in rulex \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rulex-rs/rulex \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/commit/fac6d58b25c6f9f8c0a6cdc4dec75b37b219f1d6", "ref_desc": "Fix panics due to slicing UTF8 strings incorrectly \u00b7 rulex-rs/rulex@fac6d58 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
