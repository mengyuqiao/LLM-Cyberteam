{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-28385", "Description": "An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to missing integrity checks, an attacker can manipulate the content of the emulated CD-ROM drive (containing the Windows and macOS client software). The content of this emulated CD-ROM drive is stored as an ISO-9660 image in the hidden sectors of the USB drive, that can only be accessed using special IOCTL commands, or when installing the drive in an external disk enclosure. By manipulating this ISO-9660 image or replacing it with another one, an attacker is able to store malicious software on the emulated CD-ROM drive. This software may get executed by an unsuspecting victim when using the device. For example, an attacker with temporary physical access during the supply chain could program a modified ISO-9660 image on a device that always accepts an attacker-controlled password for unlocking the device. If the attacker later on gains access to the used USB drive, he can simply decrypt all contained user data. Storing arbitrary other malicious software is also possible. This affects Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1 and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28385", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVerbatim\u00bbExecutive Fingerprint Secure Ssd FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2022-03-31cpe:2.3:o:verbatim:executive_fingerprint_secure_ssd_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Verbatim\u00bbExecutive Fingerprint Secure Ssd\u00bbVersion:N/A\nVerbatim\u00bbFingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2022-03-31cpe:2.3:o:verbatim:fingerprint_secure_portable_hard_drive_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Verbatim\u00bbFingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-30  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-19  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-13  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-11  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.05%  -1.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167536/Verbatim-Fingerprint-Secure-Portable-Hard-Drive-53650-Insufficient-Verification.html", "ref_desc": "Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive #53650 Insufficient Verification \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Jun/26", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2022-017]: Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345) (CVE-2022-28385)Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Jun/23", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2022-013]: Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345) (CVE-2022-28385)Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167546/Verbatim-Executive-Fingerprint-Secure-SSD-GDMSFE01-INI3637-C-VER1.1-Insufficient-Verification.html", "ref_desc": "Verbatim Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1 Insufficient Verification \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2022-013.txt", "ref_desc": "Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2022-017.txt", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
