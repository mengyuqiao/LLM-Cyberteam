{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-32157", "Description": "Splunk Enterprise deployment servers in versions before 9.0 allow unauthenticated downloading of forwarder bundles. Remediation requires you to update the deployment server to version 9.0 and Configure authentication for deployment servers and clients (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/ConfigDSDCAuthEnhancements#Configure_authentication_for_deployment_servers_and_clients). Once enabled, deployment servers can manage only Universal Forwarder versions 9.0 and higher. Though the vulnerability does not directly affect Universal Forwarders, remediation requires updating all Universal Forwarders that the deployment server manages to version 9.0 or higher prior to enabling the remediation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32157", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSplunk\u00bbSplunk\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 9.0cpe:2.3:a:splunk:splunk:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-02-04  0.16%  0.14%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-01-06  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-26  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-18  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-22  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-05-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://research.splunk.com/application/splunk_process_injection_forwarder_bundle_downloads/", "ref_desc": "Splunk Process Injection Forwarder Bundle Downloads - Splunk Security ContentMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/Updates", "ref_desc": "Security updates - Splunk DocumentationRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vOmsLgf60vw1G0n3xmnG76OUJV4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security/announcements/svd-2022-0607.html", "ref_desc": "SVD-2022-0607 | SplunkVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/ConfigDSDCAuthEnhancements#Configure_authentication_for_deployment_servers_and_clients", "ref_desc": "Configure authentication for deployment servers and clients - Splunk DocumentationMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
