{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31110", "Description": "RSSHub is an open source, extensible RSS feed generator. In commits prior to 5c4177441417 passing some special values to the `filter` and `filterout` parameters can cause an abnormally high CPU. This results in an impact on the performance of the servers and RSSHub services which may lead to a denial of service. This issue has been fixed in commit 5c4177441417 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31110", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRsshub\u00bbRsshub\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2022-06-21cpe:2.3:a:rsshub:rsshub:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.19%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-09-20  0.17%  0.22%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-02-18  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-02-04  0.12%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-01-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-12-10  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-06  0.06%  0.10%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-05-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/issues/10045", "ref_desc": "[Vulnerability Report Disclosure: ReDoS] Catastrophic Backtracking in User-supplied Regular Expression \u00b7 Issue #10045 \u00b7 DIYgod/RSSHub \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/security/advisories/GHSA-jvxx-v45p-v5vf", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DIYgod/RSSHub \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commit/5c4177441417b44a6e45c3c63e9eac2504abeb5b", "ref_desc": "fix: use re2, thank @Rongronggg9 \u00b7 DIYgod/RSSHub@5c41774 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
