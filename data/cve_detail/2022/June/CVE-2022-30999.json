{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30999", "Description": "FriendsofFlarum (FoF) Upload is an extension that handles file uploads intelligently for your forum. If FoF Upload prior to version 1.2.3 is configured to allow the uploading of SVG files ('image/svg+xml'), navigating directly to an SVG file URI could execute arbitrary Javascript code decided by an attacker. This Javascript code could include the execution of HTTP web requests to Flarum, or any other web service. This could allow data to be leaked by an authenticated Flarum user, or, possibly, for data to be modified maliciously. This issue has been patched with v1.2.3, which now sanitizes uploaded SVG files. As a workaround, remove the ability for users to upload SVG files through FoF Upload.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30999", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nFriendsofflarum\u00bbUploadVersions  before (<) 1.2.3cpe:2.3:a:friendsofflarum:upload:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-01-14  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-01  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.06%  -2.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/upload/pull/318", "ref_desc": "Clean and validate uploaded SVG files by imorland \u00b7 Pull Request #318 \u00b7 FriendsOfFlarum/upload \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/upload/issues/68", "ref_desc": "uploading SVG images fails \u00b7 Issue #68 \u00b7 FriendsOfFlarum/upload \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/upload/releases/tag/1.2.3", "ref_desc": "Release 1.2.3 \u00b7 FriendsOfFlarum/upload \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/upload/security/advisories/GHSA-fm53-mpmp-7qw2", "ref_desc": "Possible cross-site scripting attack via unsanitized SVG files in fof/upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FriendsOfFlarum/upload \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
