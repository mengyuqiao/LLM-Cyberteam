{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31089", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31089", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.10.12cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.2.3cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-18  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-08  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-30  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-252 Unchecked Return Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/252/Unchecked-Return-Value.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/706/Use-of-Incorrectly-Resolved-Name-or-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/5be375dec2fa35425c1003ae81c55995ac72af92", "ref_desc": "fix: invalid file request not properly handled; this fixes a security\u2026 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@5be375d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xw6g-jjvf-wwf9", "ref_desc": "Invalid file request can crash server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
