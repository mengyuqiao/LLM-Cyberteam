{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31059", "Description": "Discourse Calendar is a calendar plugin for Discourse, an open-source messaging app. Prior to version 1.0.1, parsing and rendering of Event names can be susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in version 1.0.1 of the Discourse Calendar plugin. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31059", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse Calendar\u00bbForDiscourseVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse_calendar:*:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/security/advisories/GHSA-c783-x9vm-xxp5", "ref_desc": "Event names susceptible to XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-calendar \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/pull/280", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: correctly escape event name by oblakeerickson \u00b7 Pull Request #280 \u00b7 discourse/discourse-calendar \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/commit/2719b9e81994e961bf8c4e12b4556dc9777dd62f", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: correctly escape event name (#280) \u00b7 discourse/discourse-calendar@2719b9e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
