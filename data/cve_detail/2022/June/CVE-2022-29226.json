{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29226", "Description": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 the OAuth filter implementation does not include a mechanism for validating access tokens, so by design when the HMAC signed cookie is missing a full authentication flow should be triggered. However, the current implementation assumes that access tokens are always validated thus allowing access in the presence of any access token attached to the request. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29226", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.22.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-31  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-20  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-12  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-16  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-10  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/7ffda4e809dec74449ebc330cebb9d2f4ab61360", "ref_desc": "oauth2: do not blindly accept requests with a token in the Authorizat\u2026 \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy@7ffda4e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/atg5ul3T7-8tm8G4vlFayCvbZCU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-h45c-2f94-prxh", "ref_desc": "oauth filter allows trivial bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
