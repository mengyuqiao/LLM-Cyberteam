{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24840", "Description": "django-s3file is a lightweight file upload input for Django and Amazon S3 . In versions prior to 5.5.1 it was possible to traverse the entire AWS S3 bucket and in most cases to access or delete files. If the `AWS_LOCATION` setting was set, traversal was limited to that location only. The issue was discovered by the maintainer. There were no reports of the vulnerability being known to or exploited by a third party, prior to the release of the patch. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 5.5.1 and above. There is no feasible workaround. We must urge all users to immediately updated to a patched version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24840", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDjango-s3file Project\u00bbDjango-s3fileVersions  before (<) 5.5.1cpe:2.3:a:django-s3file_project:django-s3file:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.25%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-01-26  0.38%  0.29%  -0.10 \n 3  2023-12-28  0.29%  0.38%  +0.10 \n 4  2023-11-17  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-07-09  0.23%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-06-13  0.11%  0.23%  +0.12 \n 7  2023-05-07  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/codingjoe/django-s3file/security/advisories/GHSA-4w8f-hjm9-xwgf", "ref_desc": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in django-s3file \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codingjoe/django-s3file \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codingjoe/django-s3file/commit/68ccd2c621a40eb66fdd6af2be9d5fcc9c373318", "ref_desc": "Fix CVE-XXXX-XXXX -- Fix Path Traversal security vulnerability \u00b7 codingjoe/django-s3file@68ccd2c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
