{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31052", "Description": "Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31052", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.61.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-19  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.13%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-07-05  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-05-29  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.13%  0.09%  -1.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/client-server-api/#get_matrixmediav3preview_url", "ref_desc": "Client-Server API | Matrix SpecificationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/fa1308061802ac7b7d20e954ba7372c5ac292333", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-22p3-qrh9-cx32 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse@fa13080 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGSDQ4YAITCUACAB7SXQZDJIU3IQ4CJD/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: matrix-synapse-1.61.1-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-22p3-qrh9-cx32", "ref_desc": "URL previews of unusual or maliciously-crafted pages can crash Synapse media repositories or Synapse monoliths \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7EARKKJZ2W7WUITFDT4EG4NVATFYJQHF/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: matrix-synapse-1.61.1-1.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
