{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-32563", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Couchbase Sync Gateway 3.x before 3.0.2. Admin credentials are not verified when using X.509 client-certificate authentication from Sync Gateway to Couchbase Server. When Sync Gateway is configured to authenticate with Couchbase Server using X.509 client certificates, the admin credentials provided to the Admin REST API are ignored, resulting in privilege escalation for unauthenticated users. The Public REST API is not impacted by this issue. A workaround is to replace X.509 certificate based authentication with Username and Password authentication inside the bootstrap configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32563", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCouchbase\u00bbSync GatewayVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.2cpe:2.3:a:couchbase:sync_gateway:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-01  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-21  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-13  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-17  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-05-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.couchbase.com/alerts", "ref_desc": "Alerts | CouchbaseVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/a2fvPan02-gqplKDeaktrJLuWuE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://forums.couchbase.com/tags/security", "ref_desc": "Latest security topics - Couchbase ForumsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fqTvnmIjSFL78ogBtV3fSqO5WQo.html"}]}
