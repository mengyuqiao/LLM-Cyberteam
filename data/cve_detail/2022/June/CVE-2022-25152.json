{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-25152", "Description": "The ITarian platform (SAAS / on-premise) offers the possibility to run code on agents via a function called procedures. It is possible to require a mandatory approval process. Due to a vulnerability in the approval process, present in any version prior to 6.35.37347.20040, a malicious actor (with a valid session token) can create a procedure, bypass approval, and execute the procedure. This results in the ability for any user with a valid session token to perform arbitrary code execution and full system take-over on all agents.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25152", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nItarian\u00bbSaas Service DeskVersions  before (<) 6.35.37347.20040cpe:2.3:a:itarian:saas_service_desk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nItarian\u00bbOn-premiseVersions  before (<) 6.35.37347.20040cpe:2.3:a:itarian:on-premise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-19  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-06-15  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-05-09  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.06%  -1.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-358 Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/358/Improperly-Implemented-Security-Check-for-Standard.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://csirt.divd.nl/CVE-2022-25152", "ref_desc": "ITarian - Any user with a valid session token can create and execute agent procedures and bypass mandatory approvals | DIVD CSIRTThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2021-00037", "ref_desc": "DIVD-2021-00037 - Critical vulnerabilities in ITarian MSP platform and on-premise solution | DIVD CSIRTThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Q4Slsnmxt3HMPgm2aaVMmOp00WI.html"}]}
