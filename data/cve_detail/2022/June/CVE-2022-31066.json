{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31066", "Description": "EdgeX Foundry is an open source project for building a common open framework for Internet of Things edge computing. Prior to version 2.1.1, the /api/v2/config endpoint exposes message bus credentials to local unauthenticated users. In security-enabled mode, message bus credentials are supposed to be kept in the EdgeX secret store and require authentication to access. This vulnerability bypasses the access controls on message bus credentials when running in security-enabled mode. (No credentials are required when running in security-disabled mode.) As a result, attackers could intercept data or inject fake data into the EdgeX message bus. Users should upgrade to EdgeXFoundry Kamakura release (2.2.0) or to the June 2022 EdgeXFoundry LTS Jakarta release (2.1.1) to receive a patch. More information about which go modules, docker containers, and snaps contain patches is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. There are currently no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31066", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nEdgexfoundry\u00bbEdgex FoundryVersions  before (<) 2.1.1cpe:2.3:a:edgexfoundry:edgex_foundry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go/pull/4016", "ref_desc": "fix: Remove MessageBus Options data from configuration after client created by lenny-intel \u00b7 Pull Request #4016 \u00b7 edgexfoundry/edgex-go \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go/security/advisories/GHSA-g63h-q855-vp3q", "ref_desc": "Configuration API in EdgeXFoundry 2.1.0 and earlier exposes message bus credentials to local unauthenticated users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 edgexfoundry/edgex-go \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-sdk-go/pull/1161", "ref_desc": "fix: Remove MessageBus Options data from configuration after client created by lenny-intel \u00b7 Pull Request #1161 \u00b7 edgexfoundry/device-sdk-go \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
