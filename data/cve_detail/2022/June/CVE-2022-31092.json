{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31092", "Description": "Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. Pimcore offers developers listing classes to make querying data easier. This listing classes also allow to order or group the results based on one or more columns which should be quoted by default. The actual issue is that quoting is not done properly in both cases, so there's the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the listing classes. This issue has been resolved in version 10.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade or to apple the patch manually. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31092", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nPimcore\u00bbPimcoreVersions  before (<) 10.4.4cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:pimcore:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.28%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.24%  0.30%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-02-16  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-02-02  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-01-18  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-12-08  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-30  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-07-04  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-05-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/21559c6bf0e4e828d33ff7af6e88caecb5ac6549", "ref_desc": "[Security] SQL Injection in Data Hub GraphQL (#12444) \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore@21559c6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/12444", "ref_desc": "[Security] SQL Injection in Data Hub GraphQL by mcop1 \u00b7 Pull Request #12444 \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-gvmf-wcx6-p974", "ref_desc": "Improper quoting of columns when using setOrderBy() or setGroupBy() on listing classes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
