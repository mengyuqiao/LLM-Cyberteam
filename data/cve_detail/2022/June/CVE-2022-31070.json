{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31070", "Description": "NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to block sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookies) from being forwarded to backend services configured by the application developer. This could have led to sensitive cookies being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not see them. The patched version now blocks cookies from being forwarded by default. However developers can configure an allow-list of cookie names by using the `allowedCookies` config setting. This issue has been fixed in version 0.7.0 of `@finastra/nestjs-proxy`. Users of `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` are advised that this package has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained or receiving updates. Such users should update their package.json file to use `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` instead.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31070", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFinastra\u00bbNestjs-proxy\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.7.0cpe:2.3:a:finastra:nestjs-proxy:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nNestjs-proxy Project\u00bbNestjs-proxy\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.4.0cpe:2.3:a:nestjs-proxy_project:nestjs-proxy:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-01-06  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-26  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-18  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-22  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-16  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Finastra/finastra-nodejs-libs/pull/232", "ref_desc": "[Proxy] cookies forwarding by bcldvd \u00b7 Pull Request #232 \u00b7 Finastra/finastra-nodejs-libs \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Finastra/finastra-nodejs-libs/security/advisories/GHSA-77mv-4rg7-r8qv", "ref_desc": "Potential Sensitive Cookie Exposure in NPM Packages @finastra/nestjs-proxy, @ffdc/nestjs-proxy \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Finastra/finastra-nodejs-libs \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
