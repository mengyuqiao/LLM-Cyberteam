{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31028", "Description": "MinIO is a multi-cloud object storage solution. Starting with version RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z and ending with version RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z, MinIO is vulnerable to an unending go-routine buildup while keeping connections established due to HTTP clients not closing the connections. Public-facing MinIO deployments are most affected. Users should upgrade to RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z to receive a patch. One possible workaround is to use a reverse proxy to limit the number of connections being attempted in front of MinIO, and actively rejecting connections from such malicious clients.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31028", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinioVersions  from including (>=) 2019-09-25t18-25-51zandbefore (<) 2022-06-02t02-11-04zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.18%  0.23%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-01-23  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-01-09  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-12-25  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-14  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-06  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-06-10  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-05-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-qrpr-r3pw-f636", "ref_desc": "Possible DDOS by establishing keep-alive connections with anonymous HTTP clients \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/harshavardhana/2d00e6f909054d2d2524c71485ad02e1", "ref_desc": "leak.go \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/14995", "ref_desc": "fix: add timeouts to avoid goroutine leaks in net/http by harshavardhana \u00b7 Pull Request #14995 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2022-06-03T01-40-53Z", "ref_desc": "Release Bugfix Release \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
