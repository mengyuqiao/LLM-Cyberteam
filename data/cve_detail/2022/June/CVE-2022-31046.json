{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31046", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source web content management system. Prior to versions 7.6.57 ELTS, 8.7.47 ELTS, 9.5.34 ELTS, 10.4.29, and 11.5.11, the export functionality fails to limit the result set to allowed columns of a particular database table. This way, authenticated users can export internal details of database tables they already have access to. TYPO3 versions 7.6.57 ELTS, 8.7.47 ELTS, 9.5.34 ELTS, 10.4.29, 11.5.11 fix the problem described above. In order to address this issue, access to mentioned export functionality is completely denied for regular backend users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31046", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.29cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.5.11cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3\u00bb     EltsEditionVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.35cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:elts:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3\u00bb     EltsEditionVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.6.57cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:elts:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3\u00bb     EltsEditionVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.7.47cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:elts:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-05  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-06-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-001", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-001: Information Disclosure via Export ModuleVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/7447a3d1283017d2ee08737a7972c720001a93e9", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Restrict export functionality to allowed users \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3@7447a3d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-8gmv-9hwg-w89g", "ref_desc": "Information Disclosure via Export Module \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
