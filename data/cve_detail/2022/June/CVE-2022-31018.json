{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31018", "Description": "Play Framework is a web framework for Java and Scala. A denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in verions 2.8.3 through 2.8.15 of Play's forms library, in both the Scala and Java APIs. This can occur when using either the `Form#bindFromRequest` method on a JSON request body or the `Form#bind` method directly on a JSON value. If the JSON data being bound to the form contains a deeply-nested JSON object or array, the form binding implementation may consume all available heap space and cause an `OutOfMemoryError`. If executing on the default dispatcher and `akka.jvm-exit-on-fatal-error` is enabled\u2014as it is by default\u2014then this can crash the application process. `Form.bindFromRequest` is vulnerable when using any body parser that produces a type of `AnyContent` or `JsValue` in Scala, or one that can produce a `JsonNode` in Java. This includes Play's default body parser. This vulnerability been patched in version 2.8.16. There is now a global limit on the depth of a JSON object that can be parsed, which can be configured by the user if necessary. As a workaround, applications that do not need to parse a request body of type `application/json` can switch from the default body parser to another body parser that supports only the specific type of body they expect.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31018", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLightbend\u00bbPlay FrameworkVersions  from including (>=) 2.8.3andup to, including, (<=) 2.8.15cpe:2.3:a:lightbend:play_framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-11  0.17%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-01-22  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-08  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-12-24  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-13  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-07-05  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-09  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-05-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/playframework/playframework/releases/tag/2.8.16", "ref_desc": "Release Play 2.8.16 \u00b7 playframework/playframework \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_14OMY4n3sq1Geccasc_MBQvoEw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/playframework/playframework/security/advisories/GHSA-v8x6-59g4-5g3w", "ref_desc": "Denial of service when binding forms from JSON \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 playframework/playframework \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/11301", "ref_desc": "[2.8.x] add depth limit for JSON form binding by mkurz \u00b7 Pull Request #11301 \u00b7 playframework/playframework \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
