{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31036", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v1.3.0 are vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive YAML files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a Helm-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. If the target file is a valid YAML file, the attacker can read the contents of that file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any YAML-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. Patches for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: v2.4.1, v2.3.5, v2.2.10 and v2.1.16. If you are using a version >=v2.3.0 and do not have any Helm-type Applications you may disable the Helm config management tool as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31036", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0andbefore (<) 2.1.6cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.2.9cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.2.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/61/UNIX-Symbolic-Link-Symlink-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/04c305396458508a31d03d44afea07b1c620d7cd", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-q4w5-4gq2-98vm \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd@04c3053 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-q4w5-4gq2-98vm", "ref_desc": "Symlink following allows leaking out-of-bounds YAML files from Argo CD repo-server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
