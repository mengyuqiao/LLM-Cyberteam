{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29225", "Description": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 secompressors accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate buffer before overwriting the body in the decode/encodeBody. This may allow an attacker to zip bomb the decompressor by sending a small highly compressed payload. Maliciously constructed zip files may exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may consider disabling decompression.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29225", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.22.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-31  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-16  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-409 Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/409/Improper-Handling-of-Highly-Compressed-Data-Data-Amplificat.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/cb4ef0b09200c720dfdb07e097092dd105450343", "ref_desc": "Unicorn! \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-75hv-2jjj-89hh", "ref_desc": "Decompressors can be zip bombed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
