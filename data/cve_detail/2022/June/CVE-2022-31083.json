{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31083", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31083", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.2.2cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.10.11cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-08  0.09%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2023-11-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-24  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=stttq465", "ref_desc": "Get ready for a new Game Center authentication certificate - Latest News - Apple DeveloperThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-rh9j-f5f8-rvgc", "ref_desc": "Authentication bypass vulnerability in Apple Game Center auth adapter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/ba2b0a9cb9a568817a114b132a4c2e0911d76df1", "ref_desc": "fix: certificate in Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated; thi\u2026 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@ba2b0a9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/8054", "ref_desc": "fix: certificate in Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated by mtrezza \u00b7 Pull Request #8054 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
