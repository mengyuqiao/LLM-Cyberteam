{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31106", "Description": "Underscore.deep is a collection of Underscore mixins that operate on nested objects. Versions of `underscore.deep` prior to version 0.5.3 are vulnerable to a prototype pollution vulnerability. An attacker can craft a malicious payload and pass it to `deepFromFlat`, which would pollute any future Objects created. Any users that have `deepFromFlat` or `deepPick` (due to its dependency on `deepFromFlat`) in their code should upgrade to version 0.5.3 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by modifying `deepFromFlat` to prevent specific keywords which will prevent this from happening.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31106", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nClever\u00bbUnderscore.deep\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.5.3cpe:2.3:a:clever:underscore.deep:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-01-19  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-09  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-31  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-05  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-05-29  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-915 Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/915/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Dynamically-Determined.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep/commit/b5e109ad05b48371be225fa4d490dd08a94e8ef7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8j79-hfj5-f2xm \u00b7 Clever/underscore.deep@b5e109a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep/security/advisories/GHSA-8j79-hfj5-f2xm", "ref_desc": "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution') in underscore.deep \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Clever/underscore.deep \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
