{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31085", "Description": "LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the session files include the LDAP user name and password in clear text if the PHP OpenSSL extension is not installed or encryption is disabled by configuration. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should install the PHP OpenSSL extension and make sure session encryption is enabled in LAM main configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31085", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLdap-account-manager\u00bbLdap Account Manager\u00bbForInternet ExplorerVersions  before (<) 8.0cpe:2.3:a:ldap-account-manager:ldap_account_manager:*:*:*:*:*:internet_explorer:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-18  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-08  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-30  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-07-04  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5177", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5177-1 ldap-account-managerThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q8aigTGowKHLjKYpFXXPBDg6CCE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-6m3q-5c84-6h6j", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS (Internet Explorer only) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/f1d5d04952f39a1b4ea203d3964fa88e1429dfd4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-r387-grjx-qgvw \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam@f1d5d04 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U7mdSv4dI2ymVhrQ64rfA-7XJ0Q.html"}]}
