{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-32156", "Description": "In Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder versions before 9.0, the Splunk command-line interface (CLI) did not validate TLS certificates while connecting to a remote Splunk platform instance by default. After updating to version 9.0, see Configure TLS host name validation for the Splunk CLI https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/EnableTLSCertHostnameValidation#Configure_TLS_host_name_validation_for_the_Splunk_CLI to enable the remediation. The vulnerability does not affect the Splunk Cloud Platform. At the time of publishing, we have no evidence of exploitation of this vulnerability by external parties. The issue requires conditions beyond the control of a potential bad actor such as a machine-in-the-middle attack. Hence, Splunk rates the complexity of the attack as High.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32156", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSplunk\u00bbSplunk\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 9.0cpe:2.3:a:splunk:splunk:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nSplunk\u00bbUniversal ForwarderVersions  before (<) 9.0cpe:2.3:a:splunk:universal_forwarder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.25%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-02-04  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-01-21  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-06  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-26  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-07-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-22  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-05-16  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security/announcements/svd-2022-0606.html", "ref_desc": "SVD-2022-0606 | SplunkVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/Updates", "ref_desc": "Security updates - Splunk DocumentationRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vOmsLgf60vw1G0n3xmnG76OUJV4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/EnableTLSCertHostnameValidation#Configure_TLS_host_name_validation_for_the_Splunk_CLI", "ref_desc": "Configure TLS certificate host name validation - Splunk DocumentationMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
