{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29238", "Description": "Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. Prior to version 6.4.12, authenticated requests to the notebook server with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listing the contents of hidden directories, not accessing individual hidden files or files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not 'inaccessible'). This could lead to notebook configurations allowing authenticated access to files that may reasonably be expected to be disallowed. Because fully authenticated requests are required, this is of relatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains sensitive files whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh` while serving $HOME), then any authenticated requests could access files if their names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full access to the server and therefore execution permissions, which also generally grants access to all the same files. So this does not generally result in any privilege escalation or increase in information access, only an additional, unintended means by which the files could be accessed. Version 6.4.12 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29238", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbNotebookVersions  before (<) 6.4.12cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:notebook:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-01-05  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2023-06-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.05%  -1.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/425/Direct-Request-Forced-Browsing-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/security/advisories/GHSA-v7vq-3x77-87vg", "ref_desc": "Known or guessable hidden files may be accessed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyter/notebook \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
