{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31099", "Description": "rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31099", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPomsky-lang\u00bbPomsky\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.4.3cpe:2.3:a:pomsky-lang:pomsky:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-18  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-04  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/commit/60aa2dc03a22d69c8800fec81f99c96958a11363", "ref_desc": "Add recursion limit \u00b7 rulex-rs/rulex@60aa2dc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/security/advisories/GHSA-v78m-2q7v-fjqp", "ref_desc": "Uncontrolled Recursion in rulex \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rulex-rs/rulex \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
