{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31071", "Description": "Octopoller is a micro gem for polling and retrying. Version 0.2.0 of the octopoller gem was published containing world-writeable files. Specifically, the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644). This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem. This issue is patched in Octopoller 0.3.0. Two workarounds are available. Users can use the previous version of the gem, v0.1.0. Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31071", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctopoller Project\u00bbOctopoller\u00bbVersion:0.2.0ForRubycpe:2.3:a:octopoller_project:octopoller:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-06  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/octopoller.rb/security/advisories/GHSA-26qj-cr27-r5c4", "ref_desc": "Octopoller gem published with world-writable files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octokit/octopoller.rb \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octokit/octopoller.rb/commit/abed2b8d05abe2cc3eb6bdfb34e53d465e7c7874", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #25 from octokit/updates-release-steps-checks \u00b7 octokit/octopoller.rb@abed2b8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
