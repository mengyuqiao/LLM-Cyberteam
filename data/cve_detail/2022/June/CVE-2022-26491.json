{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26491", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Pidgin before 2.14.9. A remote attacker who can spoof DNS responses can redirect a client connection to a malicious server. The client will perform TLS certificate verification of the malicious domain name instead of the original XMPP service domain, allowing the attacker to take over control over the XMPP connection and to obtain user credentials and all communication content. This is similar to CVE-2022-24968.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26491", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPidgin\u00bbPidginVersions  before (<) 2.14.9cpe:2.3:a:pidgin:pidgin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.32%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-12-09  0.27%  0.29%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-22  0.27%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-11-11  0.21%  0.27%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-09-05  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-06-07  0.13%  0.19%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-05-01  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.32%  0.12%  -1.20 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/06/msg00005.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3043-1] pidgin security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/FullChangeLog", "ref_desc": "FullChangeLog \u2013 PidginRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2022-February/038759.html", "ref_desc": "[Standards] XEP-0156 _xmppconnect is vulnerable to MITMMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://keep.imfreedom.org/pidgin/pidgin/rev/13cdb7956bdc", "ref_desc": "HGKeeperPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xsf/xeps/pull/1158", "ref_desc": "Remove _xmppconnect DNS method from XEP-0156 and add warnings by moparisthebest \u00b7 Pull Request #1158 \u00b7 xsf/xeps \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pidgin.im/about/security/advisories/cve-2022-26491/", "ref_desc": "cve-2022-26491-00 :: Pidgin, the universal chat clientVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
