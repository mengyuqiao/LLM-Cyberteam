{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31040", "Description": "Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Prior to versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1, the cookie consent page in Open Forms contains an open redirect by injecting a `referer` querystring parameter and failing to validate the value. A malicious actor is able to redirect users to a website under their control, opening them up for phishing attacks. The redirect is initiated by the open forms backend which is a legimate page, making it less obvious to end users they are being redirected to a malicious website. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. There are no known workarounds avaialble.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31040", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nMaykinmedia\u00bbOpen FormsVersions  before (<) 1.0.9cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMaykinmedia\u00bbOpen Forms\u00bbVersion:1.10cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMaykinmedia\u00bbOpen Forms\u00bbVersion:1.10UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.10:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMaykinmedia\u00bbOpen Forms\u00bbVersion:1.10UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.10:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-04  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-16  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/commit/3e8c9cce386e548765783354694fbb9d7a6ea7d3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-c97h-m5qf-j8mf \u00b7 open-formulieren/open-forms@3e8c9cc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/security/advisories/GHSA-c97h-m5qf-j8mf", "ref_desc": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in open-forms \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-formulieren/open-forms \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
