{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31050", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source web content management system. Prior to versions 9.5.34 ELTS, 10.4.29, and 11.5.11, Admin Tool sessions initiated via the TYPO3 backend user interface had not been revoked even if the corresponding user account was degraded to lower permissions or disabled completely. This way, sessions in the admin tool theoretically could have been prolonged without any limit. TYPO3 versions 9.5.34 ELTS, 10.4.29, and 11.5.11 contain a fix for the problem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31050", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.29cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.5.11cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3\u00bb     EltsEditionVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.35cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:elts:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-03  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-01-20  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-05  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-11-25  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-21  0.09%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-05-15  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-21  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-wwjw-r3gj-39fq", "ref_desc": "Insufficient Session Expiration in Admin Tool \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/592387972912290c135ebecc91768a67f83a3a4d", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Synchronize admin tools session with backend user session \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3@5923879 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-005", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-005: Insufficient Session Expiration in Admin ToolVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
