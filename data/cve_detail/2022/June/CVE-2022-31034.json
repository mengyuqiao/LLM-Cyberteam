{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31034", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v0.11.0 are vulnerable to a variety of attacks when an SSO login is initiated from the Argo CD CLI or UI. The vulnerabilities are due to the use of insufficiently random values in parameters in Oauth2/OIDC login flows. In each case, using a relatively-predictable (time-based) seed in a non-cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator made the parameter less random than required by the relevant spec or by general best practices. In some cases, using too short a value made the entropy even less sufficient. The attacks on login flows which are meant to be mitigated by these parameters are difficult to accomplish but can have a high impact potentially granting an attacker admin access to Argo CD. Patches for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: v2.4.1, v2.3.5, v2.2.10 and v2.1.16. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31034", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 0.11.0andbefore (<) 2.1.16cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.2.9cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.2.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.35%  0.32%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-01-18  0.34%  0.35%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-08  0.30%  0.34%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-07-30  0.26%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-07-22  0.16%  0.26%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-07-04  0.11%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-05-28  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/331/Insufficient-Entropy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-335 Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/335/Incorrect-Usage-of-Seeds-in-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-2m7h-86qq-fp4v", "ref_desc": "Insecure entropy in PKCE/Oauth2/OIDC params \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/17f7f4f462bdb233e1b9b36f67099f41052d8cb0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2m7h-86qq-fp4v \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd@17f7f4f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
