{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31115", "Description": "opensearch-ruby is a community-driven, open source fork of elasticsearch-ruby. In versions prior to 2.0.1 the ruby `YAML.load` function was used instead of `YAML.safe_load`. As a result opensearch-ruby 2.0.0 and prior can lead to unsafe deserialization using YAML.load if the response is of type YAML. An attacker must be in control of an opensearch server and convince the victim to connect to it in order to exploit this vulnerability. The problem has been patched in opensearch-ruby gem version 2.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31115", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 2.0.2cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.40%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.24%  0.31%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-09-06  0.24%  0.24%  0.00 \n 4  2024-08-09  0.24%  0.24%  0.00 \n 5  2024-07-26  0.24%  0.24%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-02-19  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-02-05  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 8  2024-01-21  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-12-11  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-08-02  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-07-07  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 12  2023-05-31  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://staaldraad.github.io/post/2021-01-09-universal-rce-ruby-yaml-load-updated/", "ref_desc": "Universal RCE with Ruby YAML.load (versions > 2.7) - StaaldraadExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ruby/pull/77", "ref_desc": "Use safe_load instead of load for yaml by VachaShah \u00b7 Pull Request #77 \u00b7 opensearch-project/opensearch-ruby \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ruby/security/advisories/GHSA-977c-63xq-cgw3", "ref_desc": "Unsafe YAML deserialization in Ruby Client \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/opensearch-ruby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
