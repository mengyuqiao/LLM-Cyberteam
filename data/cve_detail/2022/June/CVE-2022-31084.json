{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31084", "Description": "LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 There are cases where LAM instantiates objects from arbitrary classes. An attacker can inject the first constructor argument. This can lead to code execution if non-LAM classes are instantiated that execute code during object creation. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31084", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLdap-account-manager\u00bbLdap Account ManagerVersions  before (<) 8.0cpe:2.3:a:ldap-account-manager:ldap_account_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.64%  1.01%  -0.63 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.64%  1.64%  +1.00 \n 3  2024-03-16  0.62%  0.64%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-16  0.33%  0.62%  +0.29 \n 5  2024-02-02  0.28%  0.33%  +0.06 \n 6  2024-01-18  0.22%  0.28%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-12-08  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-07-30  0.19%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-07-04  0.11%  0.19%  +0.08 \n 10  2023-05-28  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.10%  -2.41 \n 12  2023-02-22  26.89%  2.51%  -24.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-r387-grjx-qgvw", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated Arbitrary Object Instantiation / Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/", "ref_desc": "Exploiting Arbitrary Object Instantiations in PHP without Custom Classes \u2013 PT SWARMExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5177", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5177-1 ldap-account-managerThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q8aigTGowKHLjKYpFXXPBDg6CCE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/f1d5d04952f39a1b4ea203d3964fa88e1429dfd4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-r387-grjx-qgvw \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam@f1d5d04 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U7mdSv4dI2ymVhrQ64rfA-7XJ0Q.html"}]}
