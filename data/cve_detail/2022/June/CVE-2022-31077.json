{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31077", "Description": "KubeEdge is built upon Kubernetes and extends native containerized application orchestration and device management to hosts at the Edge. In affected versions a malicious message response from KubeEdge can crash the CSI Driver controller server by triggering a nil-pointer dereference panic. As a consequence, the CSI Driver controller will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. At the time of writing, no workaround exists.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31077", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  before (<) 1.9.3cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedge\u00bbVersion:1.10.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:1.10.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedge\u00bbVersion:1.10.0UpdateBeta0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:1.10.0:beta0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-02  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-01-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-04  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/3899/commits/5d60ae9eabd6b6b7afe38758e19bbe8137664701", "ref_desc": "fix fuzzer extract message error by vincentgoat \u00b7 Pull Request #3899 \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/j0oLxWqP5qyOg7VI9IDvZ2h5Ov0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-x938-fvfw-7jh5", "ref_desc": "CloudCore CSI Driver: Malicious response from KubeEdge can crash CSI Driver controller server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/3899", "ref_desc": "fix fuzzer extract message error by vincentgoat \u00b7 Pull Request #3899 \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
