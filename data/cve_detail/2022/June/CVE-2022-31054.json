{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31054", "Description": "Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. Prior to version 1.7.1, several `HandleRoute` endpoints make use of the deprecated `ioutil.ReadAll()`. `ioutil.ReadAll()` reads all the data into memory. As such, an attacker who sends a large request to the Argo Events server will be able to crash it and cause denial of service. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo Events version 1.7.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31054", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nArgo Events Project\u00bbArgo EventsVersions  before (<) 1.7.1cpe:2.3:a:argo_events_project:argo_events:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-02  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-19  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-01-04  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 4  2023-11-24  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-16  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-06-20  0.07%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-05-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/security/advisories/GHSA-5q86-62xr-3r57", "ref_desc": "Uses of deprecated API can be used to cause DoS in user-facing endpoints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-events \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/issues/1946", "ref_desc": "8 Uses of deprecated API can be used to cause DoS in user-facing endpoints \u00b7 Issue #1946 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-events \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/pull/1966", "ref_desc": "chore: discontinue using ioutil by whynowy \u00b7 Pull Request #1966 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-events \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/commit/eaabcb6d65022fc34a0cc9ea7f00681abd326b35", "ref_desc": "chore: discontinue using ioutil (#1966) \u00b7 argoproj/argo-events@eaabcb6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
