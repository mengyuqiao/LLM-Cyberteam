{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31096", "Description": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Under certain conditions, a logged in user can redeem an invite with an email that either doesn't match the invite's email or does not adhere to the email domain restriction of an invite link. The impact of this flaw is aggravated when the invite has been configured to add the user that accepts the invite into restricted groups. Once a user has been incorrectly added to a restricted group, the user may then be able to view content which that are restricted to the respective group. Users are advised to upgrade to the current stable releases. There are no known workarounds to this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31096", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta4cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta5cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2024-01-18  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-08  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 4  2023-07-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-rvp8-459h-282r", "ref_desc": "Invites restricted to an email or invite links restricted to an email domain may be bypassed by a under certain conditions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
