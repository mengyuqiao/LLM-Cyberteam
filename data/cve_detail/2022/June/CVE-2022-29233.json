{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29233", "Description": "BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. In BigBlueButton starting with 2.2 but before 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-1, an attacker can circumvent access controls to gain access to all breakout rooms of the meeting they are in. The permission checks rely on knowledge of internal ids rather than on verification of the role of the user. Versions 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-1 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29233", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebuttonVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.3.18cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebutton\u00bbVersion:2.4UpdateAlpha1cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:2.4:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebutton\u00bbVersion:2.4UpdateAlpha2cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:2.4:alpha2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebutton\u00bbVersion:2.4UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:2.4:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebutton\u00bbVersion:2.4UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:2.4:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebutton\u00bbVersion:2.4UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:2.4:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebutton\u00bbVersion:2.4UpdateBeta4cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:2.4:beta4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-23  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2023-09-06  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.4-rc-1", "ref_desc": "Release BigBlueButton 2.4-rc-1 \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3.18", "ref_desc": "Release BigBlueButton 2.3.18 \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/b78V6ifDlfk4CO6wbcYTgsIZCFg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-3mr9-p9gw-cf33", "ref_desc": "Improper access control for breakout rooms \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14265", "ref_desc": "Backport constraint improvements to 2.3 by Tainan404 \u00b7 Pull Request #14265 \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UlPB7X8tEvnxQvuJGz0ci35xVx4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/13117", "ref_desc": "fix: Constraint viewer capability of request breakout url by jfsiebel \u00b7 Pull Request #13117 \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
