{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-25852", "Description": "All versions of package pg-native; all versions of package libpq are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when the addons attempt to cast the second argument to an array and fail. This happens for every non-array argument passed. **Note:** pg-native is a mere binding to npm's libpq library, which in turn has the addons and bindings to the actual C libpq library. This means that problems found in pg-native may transitively impact npm's libpq.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25852", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPg-native Project\u00bbPg-native\u00bbForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:pg-native_project:pg-native:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nLibpq Project\u00bbLibpq\u00bbForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:libpq_project:libpq:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-08  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-20  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-05-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-704 Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/704/Incorrect-Type-Conversion-or-Cast.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LIBPQ-2392366", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service (DoS) in libpq | CVE-2022-25852 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PGNATIVE-2392365", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service (DoS) in pg-native | CVE-2022-25852 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
