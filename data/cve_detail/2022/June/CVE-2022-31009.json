{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31009", "Description": "wire-ios is an iOS client for the Wire secure messaging application. Invalid accent colors of Wire communication partners may render the iOS Wire Client partially unusable by causing it to crash multiple times on launch. These invalid accent colors can be used by and sent between Wire users. The root cause was an unnecessary assert statement when converting an integer value into the corresponding enum value, causing an exception instead of a fallback to a default value. This issue is fixed in [wire-ios](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/commit/caa0e27dbe51f9edfda8c7a9f017d93b8cfddefb) and in Wire for iOS 3.100. There is no workaround available, but users may use other Wire clients (such as the [web app](https://app.wire.com)) to continue using Wire, or upgrade their client.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31009", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWire\u00bbWire\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 3.100cpe:2.3:a:wire:wire:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-14  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-06-30  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/security/advisories/GHSA-83m6-p7x5-925j", "ref_desc": "DoS vulnerability: Invalid Accent Colors \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wireapp/wire-ios \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/commit/caa0e27dbe51f9edfda8c7a9f017d93b8cfddefb", "ref_desc": "chore: remove unnecessary assert SQCORE-1299 (#5660) \u00b7 wireapp/wire-ios@caa0e27 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
