{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31076", "Description": "KubeEdge is built upon Kubernetes and extends native containerized application orchestration and device management to hosts at the Edge. In affected versions a malicious message can crash CloudCore by triggering a nil-pointer dereference in the UDS Server. Since the UDS Server only communicates with the CSI Driver on the cloud side, the attack is limited to the local host network. As such, an attacker would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud. Additionally it will be affected only when users turn on the unixsocket switch in the config file cloudcore.yaml. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should sisable the unixsocket switch of CloudHub in the config file cloudcore.yaml.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31076", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  before (<) 1.9.3cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedge\u00bbVersion:1.10.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:1.10.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedge\u00bbVersion:1.10.0UpdateBeta0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:1.10.0:beta0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-18  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-8f4f-v9x5-cg6j", "ref_desc": "CloudCore UDS Server: Malicious Message can crash CloudCore \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/3899/commits/5d60ae9eabd6b6b7afe38758e19bbe8137664701", "ref_desc": "fix fuzzer extract message error by vincentgoat \u00b7 Pull Request #3899 \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/j0oLxWqP5qyOg7VI9IDvZ2h5Ov0.html"}]}
