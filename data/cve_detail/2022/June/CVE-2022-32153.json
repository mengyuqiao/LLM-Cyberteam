{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-32153", "Description": "Splunk Enterprise peers in Splunk Enterprise versions before 9.0 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions before 8.2.2203 did not validate the TLS certificates during Splunk-to-Splunk communications by default. Splunk peer communications configured properly with valid certificates were not vulnerable. However, an attacker with administrator credentials could add a peer without a valid certificate and connections from misconfigured nodes without valid certificates did not fail by default. For Splunk Enterprise, update to Splunk Enterprise version 9.0 and Configure TLS host name validation for Splunk-to-Splunk communications (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/EnableTLSCertHostnameValidation) to enable the remediation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32153", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSplunk\u00bbSplunk\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 9.0cpe:2.3:a:splunk:splunk:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nSplunk\u00bbSplunk Cloud PlatformVersions  before (<) 8.2.2203cpe:2.3:a:splunk:splunk_cloud_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-17  0.66%  0.66%  0.00 \n 2  2024-02-04  0.76%  0.66%  -0.10 \n 3  2024-01-21  0.66%  0.76%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-01-06  0.57%  0.66%  +0.09 \n 5  2023-11-26  0.48%  0.57%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-09-20  0.40%  0.48%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-07-18  0.34%  0.40%  +0.06 \n 8  2023-06-22  0.13%  0.34%  +0.21 \n 9  2023-05-16  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.11%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-297 Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/297/Improper-Validation-of-Certificate-with-Host-Mismatch.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security/announcements/svd-2022-0603.html", "ref_desc": "SVD-2022-0603 | SplunkVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.splunk.com/application/splunk_protocol_impersonation_weak_encryption_selfsigned/", "ref_desc": "Splunk protocol impersonation weak encryption selfsigned - Splunk Security ContentMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iBh0UC4LO8PckYcFTDTTD3hnYto.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.splunk.com/application/splunk_digital_certificates_lack_of_encryption/", "ref_desc": "Splunk Digital Certificates Lack of Encryption - Splunk Security ContentMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KBXUbvVl2-M6M4yH8H9bQg_RyJ8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.splunk.com/network/splunk_identified_ssl_tls_certificates/", "ref_desc": "Splunk Identified SSL TLS Certificates - Splunk Security ContentMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kCEZAqGmkKVEkTE2-hEgyhhOTls.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/EnableTLSCertHostnameValidation", "ref_desc": "Configure TLS certificate host name validation - Splunk DocumentationMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q3FB78ByQwWLmd_0sRytzvTX7Vc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.splunk.com/application/splunk_digital_certificates_infrastructure_version/", "ref_desc": "Splunk Digital Certificates Infrastructure Version - Splunk Security ContentMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QMTI5sDU22NaUUUoAGYvbkRQP0U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/Updates", "ref_desc": "Security updates - Splunk DocumentationRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vOmsLgf60vw1G0n3xmnG76OUJV4.html"}]}
