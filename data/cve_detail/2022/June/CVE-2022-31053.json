{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31053", "Description": "Biscuit is an authentication and authorization token for microservices architectures. The Biscuit specification version 1 contains a vulnerable algorithm that allows malicious actors to forge valid ?-signatures. Such an attack would allow an attacker to create a token with any access level. The version 2 of the specification mandates a different algorithm than gamma signatures and as such is not affected by this vulnerability. The Biscuit implementations in Rust, Haskell, Go, Java and Javascript all have published versions following the v2 specification. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31053", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBiscuitsec\u00bbBiscuit-goVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:biscuitsec:biscuit-go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBiscuitsec\u00bbBiscuit-haskell\u00bbVersion:0.1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:biscuitsec:biscuit-haskell:0.1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBiscuitsec\u00bbBiscuit-auth\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:biscuitsec:biscuit-auth:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nClever-cloud\u00bbBiscuit-javaVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:clever-cloud:biscuit-java:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.53% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.53%  +0.26 \n 2  2024-01-04  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-11-24  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-16  0.19%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.23%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-06-20  0.14%  0.23%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-05-14  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/security/advisories/GHSA-75rw-34q6-72cr", "ref_desc": "Signature forgery in Biscuit 1.0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 biscuit-auth/biscuit \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1484", "ref_desc": "Cryptanalysis of Aggregate $\\Gamma$-Signature and Practical Countermeasures in Application to BitcoinExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
