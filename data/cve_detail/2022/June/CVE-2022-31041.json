{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31041", "Description": "Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Open Forms supports file uploads as one of the form field types. These fields can be configured to allow only certain file extensions to be uploaded by end users (e.g. only PDF / Excel / ...). The input validation of uploaded files is insufficient in versions prior to 1.0.9 and 1.1.1. Users could alter or strip file extensions to bypass this validation. This results in files being uploaded to the server that are of a different file type than indicated by the file name extension. These files may be downloaded (manually or automatically) by staff and/or other applications for further processing. Malicious files can therefore find their way into internal/trusted networks. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, an API gateway or intrusion detection solution in front of open-forms may be able to scan for and block malicious content before it reaches the Open Forms application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31041", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nMaykinmedia\u00bbOpen FormsVersions  before (<) 1.0.9cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMaykinmedia\u00bbOpen Forms\u00bbVersion:1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMaykinmedia\u00bbOpen Forms\u00bbVersion:1.1.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMaykinmedia\u00bbOpen Forms\u00bbVersion:1.1.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/security/advisories/GHSA-h85r-xv4w-cg8g", "ref_desc": "Insufficient content-type validation for uploaded files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-formulieren/open-forms \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/commit/0978a29e821a7228c5d46c0527c3e925eb91b071", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-h85r-xv4w-cg8g \u00b7 open-formulieren/open-forms@0978a29 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
