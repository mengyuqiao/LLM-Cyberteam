{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31091", "Description": "Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. In affected versions on making a request which responds with a redirect to a URI with a different port, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers from the request, before containing. Previously, we would only consider a change in host or scheme. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in scheme or change in port. An alternative approach would be to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours, if you are unable to upgrade. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31091", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGuzzlephp\u00bbGuzzleVersions  before (<) 6.5.8cpe:2.3:a:guzzlephp:guzzle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGuzzlephp\u00bbGuzzleVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.4.5cpe:2.3:a:guzzlephp:guzzle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-28  0.16%  0.23%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-09-18  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-01-18  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-07-04  0.06%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-05-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-05-22  0.09%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/security/advisories/GHSA-q559-8m2m-g699", "ref_desc": "Change in port should be considered a change in origin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 guzzle/guzzle \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-24", "ref_desc": "MediaWiki: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202305-24) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/h051VODhwTIXAz5I0azY-Et06Io.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5246", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5246-1 mediawikiThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IZHp6HJTA1DqTLgSaEtESdWEbxY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/commit/1dd98b0564cb3f6bd16ce683cb755f94c10fbd82", "ref_desc": "Release 7.4.5 (#3043) \u00b7 guzzle/guzzle@1dd98b0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tJ7hZOrcqzypyWDn-_RdcwCj-x8.html"}]}
