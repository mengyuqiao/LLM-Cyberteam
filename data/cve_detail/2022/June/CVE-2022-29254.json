{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29254", "Description": "silverstripe-omnipay is a SilverStripe integration with Omnipay PHP payments library. For a subset of Omnipay gateways (those that use intermediary states like `isNotification()` or `isRedirect()`), if the payment identifier or success URL is exposed it is possible for payments to be prematurely marked as completed without payment being taken. This is mitigated by the fact that most payment gateways hide this information from users, however some issuing banks offer flawed 3DSecure implementations that may inadvertently expose this data. The following versions have been patched to fix this issue: `2.5.2`, `3.0.2`, `3.1.4`, and `3.2.1`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29254", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripe-omnipayVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.2cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe-omnipay:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripe-omnipayVersions  before (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe-omnipay:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripe-omnipayVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.0andbefore (<) 3.1.4cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe-omnipay:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripe-omnipayVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.1cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe-omnipay:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-omnipay/security/advisories/GHSA-48f2-m7jg-866x", "ref_desc": "Failed payment recorded has completed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 silverstripe/silverstripe-omnipay \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-omnipay/commit/7dee9a1e0a5f54c2dc06e018cff3d9a19044e01b", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2022-29254] Add extra validation on payment completion \u00b7 silverstripe/silverstripe-omnipay@7dee9a1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
