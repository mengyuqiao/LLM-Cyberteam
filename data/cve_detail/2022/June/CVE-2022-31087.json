{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31087", "Description": "LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which is accessible by /lam/tmp/, allows interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc) files. An attacker capable of writing files under www-data privileges can write a web-shell into this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the host. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow executing PHP scripts in (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp directory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31087", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLdap-account-manager\u00bbLdap Account ManagerVersions  before (<) 8.0cpe:2.3:a:ldap-account-manager:ldap_account_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-18  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.37%  0.04%  -1.32 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-q8g5-45m4-q95p", "ref_desc": "Incorrect Default Permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5177", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5177-1 ldap-account-managerThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q8aigTGowKHLjKYpFXXPBDg6CCE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/f1d5d04952f39a1b4ea203d3964fa88e1429dfd4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-r387-grjx-qgvw \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam@f1d5d04 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U7mdSv4dI2ymVhrQ64rfA-7XJ0Q.html"}]}
