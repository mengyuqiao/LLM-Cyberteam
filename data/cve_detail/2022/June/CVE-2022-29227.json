{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29227", "Description": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 if Envoy attempts to send an internal redirect of an HTTP request consisting of more than HTTP headers, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lifetime bug which can be triggered. If while replaying the request Envoy sends a local reply when the redirect headers are processed, the downstream state indicates that the downstream stream is not complete. On sending the local reply, Envoy will attempt to reset the upstream stream, but as it is actually complete, and deleted, this result in a use-after-free. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade are advised to disable internal redirects if crashes are observed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29227", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.22.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-31  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-rm2p-qvf6-pvr6", "ref_desc": "Internal redirect crash for requests with body/trailers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/fe7c69c248f4fe5a9080c7ccb35275b5218bb5ab", "ref_desc": "Unicorn! \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
