{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-32234", "Description": "An out of bounds write in hermes, while handling large arrays, prior to commit 06eaec767e376bfdb883d912cb15e987ddf2bda1 allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32234", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermesVersions  before (<) 0.12.0cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-03  0.33%  0.31%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-03-23  0.29%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-11-12  0.25%  0.29%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-10-17  0.16%  0.25%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-09-10  0.13%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.13%  -1.31 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/CVE-2022-32234", "ref_desc": "FacebookVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/06eaec767e376bfdb883d912cb15e987ddf2bda1", "ref_desc": "Re-sync with internal repository (#772) \u00b7 facebook/hermes@06eaec7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
