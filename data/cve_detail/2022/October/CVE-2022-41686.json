{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41686", "Description": "OpenHarmony-v3.1.2 and prior versions, 3.0.6 and prior versions have an Out-of-bound memory read and write vulnerability in /dev/mmz_userdev device driver. The impact depends on the privileges of the attacker. The unprivileged process run on the device could read out-of-bound memory leading sensitive to information disclosure. The processes with system user UID run on the device would be able to write out-of-bound memory which could lead to unspecified memory corruption.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41686", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nOpenharmony\u00bbOpenharmony\u00bb     Long Term SupportEditionVersions  from including (>=) 3.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.0.6cpe:2.3:a:openharmony:openharmony:*:*:*:*:long_term_support:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenatom\u00bbOpenharmony\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 3.1andup to, including, (<=) 3.1.2cpe:2.3:o:openatom:openharmony:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-03  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gitee.com/openharmony/security/blob/master/en/security-disclosure/2022/2022-10.md", "ref_desc": "en/security-disclosure/2022/2022-10.md \u00b7 OpenHarmony/security - Gitee.comThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3fJ3L9-LBqBqXpVTWe-2Bm2emKQ.html"}]}
