{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39355", "Description": "Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39355", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbPatreonVersions  before (<) 2022-10-26cpe:2.3:a:discourse:patreon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.20%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-05-18  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-07  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-11-28  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-11-02  0.11%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-09-26  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/commit/846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Check for email verification status during login (#92) \u00b7 discourse/discourse-patreon@846d012 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/security/advisories/GHSA-fvj9-f67v-qpr4", "ref_desc": "Improper validation of email during Patreon authentication \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-patreon \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
