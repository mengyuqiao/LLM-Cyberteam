{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39285", "Description": "ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application The file parameter is vulnerable to a cross site scripting vulnerability (XSS) by backing out of the current \"tr\" \"td\" brackets. This then allows a malicious user to provide code that will execute when a user views the specific log on the \"view=log\" page. This vulnerability allows an attacker to store code within the logs that will be executed when loaded by a legitimate user. These actions will be performed with the permission of the victim. This could lead to data loss and/or further exploitation including account takeover. This issue has been addressed in versions `1.36.27` and `1.37.24`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable database logging.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39285", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nZoneminder\u00bbZoneminderVersions  before (<) 1.36.27cpe:2.3:a:zoneminder:zoneminder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZoneminder\u00bbZoneminderVersions  after (>) 1.37.0andbefore (<) 1.37.24cpe:2.3:a:zoneminder:zoneminder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-04-29  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171498/Zoneminder-Log-Injection-XSS-Cross-Site-Request-Forgery.html", "ref_desc": "Zoneminder Log Injection / XSS / Cross Site Request Forgery \u2248 Packet StormCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-xkNSOOERQSzrMuO5Ntpjla1i3Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/security/advisories/GHSA-h6xp-cvwv-q433", "ref_desc": "Stored Cross-Site Script Vulnerability In File Parameter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ZoneMinder/zoneminder \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/commit/d289eb48601a76e34feea3c1683955337b1fae59", "ref_desc": "File must be escaped as well to prevent XSS \u00b7 ZoneMinder/zoneminder@d289eb4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/commit/c0a4c05e84eea0f6ccf7169c014efe5422c9ba0d", "ref_desc": "Only perform actions on post.
