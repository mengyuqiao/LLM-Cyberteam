{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39321", "Description": "GitHub Actions Runner is the application that runs a job from a GitHub Actions workflow. The actions runner invokes the docker cli directly in order to run job containers, service containers, or container actions. A bug in the logic for how the environment is encoded into these docker commands was discovered in versions prior to 2.296.2, 2.293.1, 2.289.4, 2.285.2, and 2.283.4 that allows an input to escape the environment variable and modify that docker command invocation directly. Jobs that use container actions, job containers, or service containers alongside untrusted user inputs in environment variables may be vulnerable. The Actions Runner has been patched, both on `github.com` and hotfixes for GHES and GHAE customers in versions 2.296.2, 2.293.1, 2.289.4, 2.285.2, and 2.283.4. GHES and GHAE customers may want to patch their instance in order to have their runners automatically upgrade to these new runner versions. As a workaround, users may consider removing any container actions, job containers, or service containers from their jobs until they are able to upgrade their runner versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39321", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbRunnerVersions  from including (>=) 2.294.0andbefore (<) 2.296.2cpe:2.3:a:github:runner:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbRunnerVersions  from including (>=) 2.290.0andbefore (<) 2.293.1cpe:2.3:a:github:runner:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbRunnerVersions  from including (>=) 2.284.0andbefore (<) 2.285.2cpe:2.3:a:github:runner:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbRunnerVersions  before (<) 2.283.4cpe:2.3:a:github:runner:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbRunnerVersions  from including (>=) 2.286.0andbefore (<) 2.289.4cpe:2.3:a:github:runner:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-07-14  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-29  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-06-01  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-17  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 6  2024-04-06  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 7  2023-11-01  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-09-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/2107", "ref_desc": "2.296.2 Release notes by thboop \u00b7 Pull Request #2107 \u00b7 actions/runner \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/2108", "ref_desc": "Port hotfix to main branch by thboop \u00b7 Pull Request #2108 \u00b7 actions/runner \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/actions/runner/security/advisories/GHSA-2c6m-6gqh-6qg3", "ref_desc": "Docker Command Escaping in the GitHub Actions Runner \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 actions/runner \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
