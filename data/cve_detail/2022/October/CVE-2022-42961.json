{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-42961", "Description": "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. A fault injection attack on RAM via Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure. Users performing signing operations with private ECC keys, such as in server-side TLS connections, might leak faulty ECC signatures. These signatures can be processed via an advanced technique for ECDSA key recovery. (In 5.5.0 and later, WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS can be used to address the vulnerability.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42961", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWolfssl\u00bbWolfsslVersions  before (<) 5.5.0cpe:2.3:a:wolfssl:wolfssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-05-07  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-03-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.5.0-stable", "ref_desc": "Release wolfSSL Release 5.5.0 (Aug 30, 2022) \u00b7 wolfSSL/wolfssl \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
