{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39222", "Description": "Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps. Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining access to applications accepting that token. Version 2.35.0 has introduced a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39222", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbDEXVersions  before (<) 2.35.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:dex:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.26%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-04-28  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-18  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-13  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-09-06  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-12  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dexidp/dex/commit/49471b14c8080ddb034d4855841123d378b7a634", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vh7g-p26c-j2cw \u00b7 dexidp/dex@49471b1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/GHSA-vh7g-p26c-j2cw", "ref_desc": "Backchannel attack allows an attacker to fetch an ID token through an intercepted authorization code \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dexidp/dex \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
