{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36063", "Description": "Azure RTOS USBx is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all Azure RTOS ThreadX\u2013supported processors. Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36063", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Input validation;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbAzure Rtos UsbxVersions  before (<) 6.1.11cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:azure_rtos_usbx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.24%  1.52%  -1.71 \n 2  2024-11-19  3.57%  3.24%  -0.33 \n 3  2024-07-29  3.51%  3.57%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-05-31  2.95%  3.51%  +0.57 \n 5  2024-05-17  2.42%  2.95%  +0.53 \n 6  2024-05-02  2.71%  2.42%  -0.29 \n 7  2024-03-22  3.04%  2.71%  -0.33 \n 8  2024-01-02  2.82%  3.04%  +0.22 \n 9  2023-11-12  2.24%  2.82%  +0.58 \n 10  2023-10-30  1.76%  2.24%  +0.48 \n 11  2023-10-17  1.66%  1.76%  +0.11 \n 12  2023-10-06  1.44%  1.66%  +0.22 \n 13  2023-09-10  1.62%  1.44%  -0.19 \n 14  2023-08-17  1.04%  1.62%  +0.58 \n 15  2023-08-06  1.04%  1.04%  0.00 \n 16  2023-04-17  1.04%  1.04%  +0.00 \n 17  2023-03-23  1.37%  1.04%  -0.33 \n 18  2023-03-15  0.94%  1.37%  +0.43 \n 19  2023-03-07  10.15%  0.94%  -9.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel", "ref_desc": "Release Azure RTOS 6.1.12 \u00b7 azure-rtos/usbx \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4h_WJQIopIgYhXXMAvFzUcw0kec.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/security/advisories/GHSA-chpp-5fv9-6368", "ref_desc": "USBX Host CDC ECD integer underflow with buffer overflow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 azure-rtos/usbx \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get.c#L264", "ref_desc": "usbx/ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get.c at master \u00b7 azure-rtos/usbx \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
