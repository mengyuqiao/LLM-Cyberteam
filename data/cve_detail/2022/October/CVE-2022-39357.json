{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39357", "Description": "Winter is a free, open-source content management system based on the Laravel PHP framework. The Snowboard framework in versions 1.1.8, 1.1.9, and 1.2.0 is vulnerable to prototype pollution in the main Snowboard class as well as its plugin loader. The 1.0 branch of Winter is not affected, as it does not contain the Snowboard framework. This issue has been patched in v1.1.10 and v1.2.1. As a workaround, one may avoid this issue by following some common security practices for JavaScript, including implementing a content security policy and auditing scripts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39357", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWintercms\u00bbWinter\u00bbVersion:1.1.9cpe:2.3:a:wintercms:winter:1.1.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWintercms\u00bbWinter\u00bbVersion:1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:wintercms:winter:1.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWintercms\u00bbWinter\u00bbVersion:1.1.8cpe:2.3:a:wintercms:winter:1.1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-16  0.44%  0.46%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-02  0.38%  0.44%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-05-18  0.39%  0.38%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.33%  0.39%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-01-31  0.29%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-11-28  0.24%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-11-02  0.14%  0.24%  +0.10 \n 8  2023-09-26  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wintercms/winter/security/advisories/GHSA-3fh5-q6fg-w28q", "ref_desc": "Prototype pollution in Snowboard framework \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wintercms/winter \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wintercms/winter/releases/tag/v1.2.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.2.1 \u00b7 wintercms/winter \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/2a13faf99972e84c9661258f16c4750fa99d29a1", "ref_desc": "Harden Snowboard (#687) \u00b7 wintercms/winter@2a13faf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/bce4b59584abf961e9400af3d7a4fd7638e26c7f", "ref_desc": "Harden Snowboard (#687) \u00b7 wintercms/winter@bce4b59 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wintercms/winter/releases/tag/v1.1.10", "ref_desc": "Release v1.1.10 \u00b7 wintercms/winter \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
