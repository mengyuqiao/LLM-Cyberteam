{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-40764", "Description": "Snyk CLI before 1.996.0 allows arbitrary command execution, affecting Snyk IDE plugins and the snyk npm package. Exploitation could follow from the common practice of viewing untrusted files in the Visual Studio Code editor, for example. The original demonstration was with shell metacharacters in the vendor.json ignore field, affecting snyk-go-plugin before 1.19.1. This affects, for example, the Snyk TeamCity plugin (which does not update automatically) before 20220930.142957.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40764", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSnyk\u00bbCLIVersions  before (<) 1.996.0cpe:2.3:a:snyk:cli:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSnyk\u00bbGolang CliVersions  before (<) 1.19.1cpe:2.3:a:snyk:golang_cli:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-05-24  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-10-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-10  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-04-18  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.37%  0.04%  -1.32 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/7015908293789-CVE-2022-40764-Command-Injection-vulnerability-affecting-Snyk-CLI-versions-prior-to-1-996-0", "ref_desc": "Security checkPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.imperva.com/blog/how-scanning-your-projects-for-security-issues-can-lead-to-remote-code-execution/", "ref_desc": "How Scanning Your Projects for Security Issues Can Lead to Remote Code Execution | ImpervaExploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oSMF5wUjnAgIRavJdixRUOeWK88.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases/tag/v1.996.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.996.0 \u00b7 snyk/cli \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snyk/snyk-go-plugin/releases/tag/v1.19.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.19.1 \u00b7 snyk/snyk-go-plugin \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
