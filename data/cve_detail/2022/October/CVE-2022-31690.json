{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31690", "Description": "Spring Security, versions 5.7 prior to 5.7.5, and 5.6 prior to 5.6.9, and older unsupported versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation under certain conditions. A malicious user or attacker can modify a request initiated by the Client (via the browser) to the Authorization Server which can lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario can happen if the Authorization Server responds with an OAuth2 Access Token Response containing an empty scope list (per RFC 6749, Section 5.1) on the subsequent request to the token endpoint to obtain the access token.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31690", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbSpring SecurityVersions  from including (>=) 5.6.0andbefore (<) 5.6.9cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbSpring SecurityVersions  from including (>=) 5.7.0andbefore (<) 5.7.5cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbActive Iq Unified Manager\u00bbVersion:N/AForVmware Vspherecpe:2.3:a:netapp:active_iq_unified_manager:-:*:*:*:*:vmware_vsphere:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbActive Iq Unified Manager\u00bbVersion:N/AForWindowscpe:2.3:a:netapp:active_iq_unified_manager:-:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-23  0.26%  0.25%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-04-12  0.31%  0.26%  -0.05 \n 4  2024-03-16  0.41%  0.31%  -0.10 \n 5  2024-01-10  0.56%  0.41%  -0.15 \n 6  2023-12-03  0.50%  0.56%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-11-07  0.63%  0.50%  -0.13 \n 8  2023-10-27  0.45%  0.63%  +0.17 \n 9  2023-10-01  0.38%  0.45%  +0.07 \n 10  2023-09-20  0.27%  0.38%  +0.11 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.27%  -0.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221215-0010/", "ref_desc": "October 2022 Spring Security Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/87GAerix52FCTYQSVlWVdflcvXw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-31690", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-31690 | Security | VMware TanzuMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
