{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39959", "Description": "Panini Everest Engine 2.0.4 allows unprivileged users to create a file named Everest.exe in the %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini folder. This leads to privilege escalation because a service, running as SYSTEM, uses the unquoted path of %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini\\Everest Engine\\EverestEngine.exe and therefore a Trojan horse %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini\\Everest.exe may be executed instead of the intended vendor-supplied EverestEngine.exe file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39959", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPanini\u00bbEverest Engine\u00bbVersion:2.0.4cpe:2.3:a:panini:everest_engine:2.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-29  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-428 Unquoted Search Path or Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/428/Unquoted-Search-Path-or-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.panini.com/en/news-events/panini-patents-revolutionary-new-%E2%80%9Ceverest%E2%80%9D-architecture", "ref_desc": "Panini Patents Revolutionary New \u201cEverest\u201d Architecture | PaniniVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/usmarine2141/CVE-2022-39959", "ref_desc": "GitHub - usmarine2141/CVE-2022-39959: CVE-2022-39959Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
