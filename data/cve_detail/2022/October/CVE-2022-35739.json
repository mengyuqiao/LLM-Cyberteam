{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35739", "Description": "PRTG Network Monitor through 22.2.77.2204 does not prevent custom input for a device\u2019s icon, which can be modified to insert arbitrary content into the style tag for that device. When the device page loads, the arbitrary Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) data is inserted into the style tag, loading malicious content. Due to PRTG Network Monitor preventing \u201ccharacters, and from modern browsers disabling JavaScript support in style tags, this vulnerability could not be escalated into a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35739", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPaessler\u00bbPrtg Network MonitorVersions  before (<) 22.3.79.2108cpe:2.3:a:paessler:prtg_network_monitor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-05-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-06  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-01  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-09-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://raxis.com/blog/cve-2022-35739", "ref_desc": "CVE 2022-35739 PRTG Network Monitor CSS Injection \u2014 RaxisExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.paessler.com/prtg/history/stable", "ref_desc": "Paessler AG - Version HistoryRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vc3POdyZpHW1_0LZxmI-wCoiyS0.html"}]}
