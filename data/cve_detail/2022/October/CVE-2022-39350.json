{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39350", "Description": "@dependencytrack/frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) used in Dependency-Track, an open source Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Due to the common practice of providing vulnerability details in markdown format, the Dependency-Track frontend renders them using the JavaScript library Showdown. Showdown does not have any XSS countermeasures built in, and versions before 4.6.1 of the Dependency-Track frontend did not encode or sanitize Showdown's output. This made it possible for arbitrary JavaScript included in vulnerability details via HTML attributes to be executed in context of the frontend. Actors with the `VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT` permission can exploit this weakness by creating or editing a custom vulnerability and providing XSS payloads in any of the following fields: Description, Details, Recommendation, or References. The payload will be executed for users with the `VIEW_PORTFOLIO` permission when browsing to the modified vulnerability's page. Alternatively, malicious JavaScript could be introduced via any of the vulnerability databases mirrored by Dependency-Track. However, this attack vector is highly unlikely, and the maintainers of Dependency-Track are not aware of any occurrence of this happening. Note that the `Vulnerability Details` element of the `Audit Vulnerabilities` tab in the project view is not affected. The issue has been fixed in frontend version 4.6.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39350", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOwasp\u00bbDependency-track FrontendVersions  before (<) 4.6.1cpe:2.3:a:owasp:dependency-track_frontend:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-10  0.08%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/security/advisories/GHSA-c33w-pm52-mqvf", "ref_desc": "Persistent Cross-Site-Scripting via Vulnerability Details \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DependencyTrack/frontend \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.dependencytrack.org/changelog/", "ref_desc": "Change Log | Dependency-TrackRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FlOTttLns98aSxJDUmAJAFS06LM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Markdown's-XSS-Vulnerability-(and-how-to-mitigate-it)", "ref_desc": "Markdown's XSS Vulnerability (and how to mitigate it) \u00b7 showdownjs/showdown Wiki \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
