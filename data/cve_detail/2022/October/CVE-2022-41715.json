{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41715", "Description": "Programs which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may be vulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input, but in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than that are rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41715", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGolang\u00bbGOVersions  from including (>=) 1.19.0andbefore (<) 1.19.2cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGolang\u00bbGOVersions  before (<) 1.18.7cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-04  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-05-21  0.16%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-06  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-26  0.13%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-01-19  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-11-16  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-10-21  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-09-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://go.dev/issue/55949", "ref_desc": "regexp/syntax: limit memory used by parsing regexps \u00b7 Issue #55949 \u00b7 golang/go \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xtuG5faxtaU", "ref_desc": "[security] Go 1.19.2 and Go 1.18.7 are releasedMailing List;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DbM0zPBL97TgiUfNxydZQwbTpvs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1039", "ref_desc": "GO-2022-1039 - Go PackagesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://go.dev/cl/439356", "ref_desc": "regexp: limit size of parsed regexps (Ia656baed) \u00b7 Gerrit Code ReviewPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09", "ref_desc": "Go: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202311-09) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/p0S2LtT_x1kmcmHYI6CuiiC_cDA.html"}]}
