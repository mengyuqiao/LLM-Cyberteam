{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39362", "Description": "Metabase is data visualization software. Prior to versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9, unsaved SQL queries are auto-executed, which could pose a possible attack vector. This issue is patched in versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9. Metabase no longer automatically executes ad-hoc native queries. Now the native editor shows the query and gives the user the option to manually run the query if they want.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39362", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.44.0andbefore (<) 0.44.5cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.42.0andbefore (<) 1.42.6cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.41.0andbefore (<) 1.41.9cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.43.0andbefore (<) 0.43.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.43.0andbefore (<) 1.43.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.41.0andbefore (<) 0.41.9cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.42.0andbefore (<) 0.42.6cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.44.0andbefore (<) 1.44.5cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-18  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-07  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-02  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-356 Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/356/Product-UI-does-not-Warn-User-of-Unsafe-Actions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/commit/b7c6bb905a9187347cfc9035443b514713027a5c", "ref_desc": "Do not autorun ad-hoc native queries (#25675) (#25732) \u00b7 metabase/metabase@b7c6bb9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-93wj-fgjg-r238", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary SQL execution from queryhash \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
