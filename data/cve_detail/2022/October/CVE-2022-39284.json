{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39284", "Description": "CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. In versions prior to 4.2.7 setting `$secure` or `$httponly` value to `true` in `Config\\Cookie` is not reflected in `set_cookie()` or `Response::setCookie()`. As a result cookie values are erroneously exposed to scripts. It should be noted that this vulnerability does not affect session cookies. Users are advised to upgrade to v4.2.7 or later. Users unable to upgrade are advised to manually construct their cookies either by setting the options in code or by constructing Cookie objects. Examples of each workaround are available in the linked GHSA.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39284", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCodeigniter\u00bbCodeigniterVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.7cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter:codeigniter:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-04-28  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2023-10-13  0.08%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.08%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-665 Improper Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/665/Improper-Initialization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/outgoing/response.html#CodeIgniter%5CHTTP%5CResponse::setCookie", "ref_desc": "HTTP Responses \u2014 CodeIgniter 4.2.7 documentationTechnical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies", "ref_desc": "Using HTTP cookies - HTTP | MDNTechnical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/helpers/cookie_helper.html#set_cookie", "ref_desc": "Cookie Helper \u2014 CodeIgniter 4.2.7 documentationTechnical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/pull/6544", "ref_desc": "fix: set_cookie() does not use Config\\Cookie values by kenjis \u00b7 Pull Request #6544 \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/security/advisories/GHSA-745p-r637-7vvp", "ref_desc": "Secure or HttpOnly flag set in Config\\Cookie is not reflected in Cookies issued in Codeigniter4 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4 \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues/6540", "ref_desc": "Bug: set_cookie not using default value of $secure from config \u00b7 Issue #6540 \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
