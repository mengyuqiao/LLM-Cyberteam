{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39298", "Description": "MelisFront is the engine that displays website hosted on Melis Platform. It deals with showing pages, plugins, URL rewritting, search optimization and SEO, etc. Attackers can deserialize arbitrary data on affected versions of `melisplatform/melis-front`, and ultimately leads to the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the system. Conducting this attack does not require authentication. Users should immediately upgrade to `melisplatform/melis-front` >= 5.0.1. This issue was addressed by restricting allowed classes when deserializing user-controlled data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39298", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMelistechnology\u00bbMeliscmsVersions  before (<) 5.0.1cpe:2.3:a:melistechnology:meliscms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.41%  0.29%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-05-04  0.44%  0.41%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-03-24  0.29%  0.44%  +0.15 \n 4  2023-11-14  0.25%  0.29%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-10-19  0.16%  0.25%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-09-12  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.14%  -1.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-front/security/advisories/GHSA-h479-2mv4-5c26", "ref_desc": "Deserialization of untrusted data in \\MelisFront\\Controller\\MelisPluginRendererController \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 melisplatform/melis-front \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-front/commit/89ae612d5f1f7aa2fb621ee8de27dffe1feb851e", "ref_desc": "added allowed_classes=false param to unserialize function and changed\u2026 \u00b7 melisplatform/melis-front@89ae612 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
