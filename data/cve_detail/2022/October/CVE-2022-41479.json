{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41479", "Description": "The DevExpress Resource Handler (ASPxHttpHandlerModule) in DevExpress ASP.NET Web Forms Build v19.2.3 does not verify the referenced objects in the /DXR.axd?r= HTTP GET parameter. This leads to an Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability which allows attackers to access the application source code. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the retrieved source code is only the DevExpress client-side application code that is, of course, intentionally readable by web browsers (a site's custom code and data is never accessible via an IDOR approach).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41479", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDevexpress\u00bbAsp.net Web Forms Controls\u00bbVersion:19.2.3cpe:2.3:a:devexpress:asp.net_web_forms_controls:19.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-06  0.21%  0.17%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-05-10  0.18%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-30  0.17%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-11-20  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-10-25  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-09-18  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/IthacaLabs/DevExpress/tree/main/ASP.NET_Web_Forms_Build_19.2.3", "ref_desc": "DevExpress/ASP.NET_Web_Forms_Build_19.2.3 at main \u00b7 IthacaLabs/DevExpress \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/t190349/false-positive-vulnerabilities-known-alerts-detected-by-various-security-scanners-and", "ref_desc": "Just a moment...", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/t1171808/penetration-test-idor-source-code-cve-2022-41479", "ref_desc": "Just a moment...", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
