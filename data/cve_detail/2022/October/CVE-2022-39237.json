{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39237", "Description": "syslabs/sif is the Singularity Image Format (SIF) reference implementation. In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity` package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are cryptographically secure.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39237", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSylabs\u00bbSingularity Image FormatVersions  before (<) 2.8.1cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity_image_format:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-27  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-13  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-18  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-10-13  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-09-06  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-19", "ref_desc": "Apptainer: Lack of Digital Signature Hash Verification (GLSA 202210-19) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sylabs/sif/security/advisories/GHSA-m5m3-46gj-wch8", "ref_desc": "Digital Signature Hash Algorithms Not Validated \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sylabs/sif \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sylabs/sif/commit/07fb86029a12e3210f6131e065570124605daeaa", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-m5m3-46gj-wch8 \u00b7 sylabs/sif@07fb860 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
