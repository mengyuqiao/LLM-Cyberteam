{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-40138", "Description": "An integer conversion error in Hermes bytecode generation, prior to commit 6aa825e480d48127b480b08d13adf70033237097, could have been used to perform Out-Of-Bounds operations and subsequently execute arbitrary code. Note that this is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40138", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermesVersions  before (<) 2022-09-27cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-03  0.33%  0.31%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-03-23  0.29%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-11-12  0.25%  0.29%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-10-17  0.16%  0.25%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-09-10  0.13%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.13%  -1.31 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-681 Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/681/Incorrect-Conversion-between-Numeric-Types.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/6aa825e480d48127b480b08d13adf70033237097", "ref_desc": "Re-sync with internal repository (#822) \u00b7 facebook/hermes@6aa825e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/CVE-2022-40138", "ref_desc": "FacebookVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
