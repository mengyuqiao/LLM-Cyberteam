{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39359", "Description": "Metabase is data visualization software. Prior to versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9, custom GeoJSON map URL address would follow redirects to addresses that were otherwise disallowed, like link-local or private-network. This issue is patched in versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9. Metabase no longer follow redirects on GeoJSON map URLs. An environment variable `MB_CUSTOM_GEOJSON_ENABLED` was also added to disable custom GeoJSON completely (`true` by default).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39359", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.44.0andbefore (<) 0.44.5cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.42.0andbefore (<) 1.42.6cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.41.0andbefore (<) 1.41.9cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.43.0andbefore (<) 0.43.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.43.0andbefore (<) 1.43.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.41.0andbefore (<) 0.41.9cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.42.0andbefore (<) 0.42.6cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.44.0andbefore (<) 1.44.5cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-18  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-07  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2023-11-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/commit/057e2d67fcbeb6b48db68b697e022243e3a5771e", "ref_desc": "Refactor GeoJSON URL fetching logic (#25816) (#25821) \u00b7 metabase/metabase@057e2d6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-w5j7-4mgm-77f4", "ref_desc": "GeoJSON validation doesn't prevent redirects to blocked URLs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
