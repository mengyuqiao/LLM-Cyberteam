{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35289", "Description": "A write-what-where condition in hermes caused by an integer overflow, prior to commit 5b6255ae049fa4641791e47fad994e8e8c4da374 allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35289", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermesVersions  before (<) 0.12.0cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-03  0.33%  0.31%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-03-23  0.29%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-11-12  0.25%  0.29%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-10-17  0.16%  0.25%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-09-10  0.13%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.13%  -1.31 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-680 Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/680/Integer-Overflow-to-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/CVE-2022-35289", "ref_desc": "FacebookVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/5b6255ae049fa4641791e47fad994e8e8c4da374", "ref_desc": "Re-sync with internal repository (#791) \u00b7 facebook/hermes@5b6255a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
