{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39229", "Description": "Grafana is an open source data visualization platform for metrics, logs, and traces. Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 allow one user to block another user's login attempt by registering someone else'e email address as a username. A Grafana user\u2019s username and email address are unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address as another user. A user can have an email address as a username. However, the login system allows users to log in with either username or email address. Since Grafana allows a user to log in with either their username or email address, this creates an usual behavior where `user_1` can register with one email address and `user_2` can register their username as `user_1`\u2019s email address. This prevents `user_1` logging into the application since `user_1`'s password won\u2019t match with `user_2`'s email address. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39229", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  before (<) 8.5.14cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.1.8cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-05  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-20  0.06%  0.12%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-09-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases/tag/v9.1.8", "ref_desc": "Release 9.1.8 (2022-10-11) \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5MYTETmzgN2Xj7vCN2GapYQCCc0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/5644758f0c5ae9955a4e5480d71f9bef57fdce35", "ref_desc": "Add test for username/login field conflict \u00b7 grafana/grafana@5644758 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-gj7m-853r-289r", "ref_desc": "Using email as a username can block other users from signing in \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
