{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39274", "Description": "LoRaMac-node is a reference implementation and documentation of a LoRa network node. Versions of LoRaMac-node prior to 4.7.0 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Improper size validation of the incoming radio frames can lead to an 65280-byte out-of-bounds write. The function `ProcessRadioRxDone` implicitly expects incoming radio frames to have at least a payload of one byte or more. An empty payload leads to a 1-byte out-of-bounds read of user controlled content when the payload buffer is reused. This allows an attacker to craft a FRAME_TYPE_PROPRIETARY frame with size -1 which results in an 65280-byte out-of-bounds memcopy likely with partially controlled attacker data. Corrupting a large part if the data section is likely to cause a DoS. If the large out-of-bounds write does not immediately crash the attacker may gain control over the execution due to now controlling large parts of the data section. Users are advised to upgrade either by updating their package or by manually applying the patch commit `e851b079`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39274", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSemtech\u00bbLoramac-nodeVersions  before (<) 4.7.0cpe:2.3:a:semtech:loramac-node:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.41%  0.29%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-07-25  0.29%  0.41%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-05-27  0.17%  0.29%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-05-13  0.13%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-04-28  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-03-18  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-08  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-10-13  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-09-06  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-06-28  0.09%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.09%  -2.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-193 Off-by-one Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/193/Off-by-one-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node/releases/tag/v4.7.0", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node/security/advisories/GHSA-7vv8-73pc-63c2", "ref_desc": "Buffer Overflow in `ProcessRadioRxDone` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Lora-net/LoRaMac-node \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node/commit/e851b079c82ba1bcf3f4d291ab69a571b0bf458a", "ref_desc": "Fixed potential buffer overflow in `ProcessRadioRxDone` \u00b7 Lora-net/LoRaMac-node@e851b07 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
