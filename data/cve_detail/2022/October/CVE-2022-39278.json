{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39278", "Description": "Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection. Prior to versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9, the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially external istiod topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in `regexp.Compile` in Go.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39278", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  before (<) 1.13.9cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.14.5cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.15.0andbefore (<) 1.15.2cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-03  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-20  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-05-05  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-03-25  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-15  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-10-20  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-09-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://istio.io/news/releases/1.14.x/announcing-1.14.5/", "ref_desc": "Istio / Announcing Istio 1.14.5Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/istio/security/advisories/GHSA-86vr-4wcv-mm9w", "ref_desc": "Denial of service attack due to Golang Regex Library \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 istio/istio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.13.x/announcing-1.13.9/", "ref_desc": "Istio / Announcing Istio 1.13.9Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.15.x/announcing-1.15.2/", "ref_desc": "Istio / Announcing Istio 1.15.2Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
