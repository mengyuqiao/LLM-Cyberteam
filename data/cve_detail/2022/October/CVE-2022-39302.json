{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39302", "Description": "Ree6 is a moderation bot. This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target. This would mean you could send log messages to another Guild channel and bypass raid and webhook protections. A specifically crafted log message could allow spamming and mass advertisements. This issue has been patched in version 1.9.9. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39302", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRee6\u00bbRee6Versions  before (<) 1.9.9cpe:2.3:a:ree6:ree6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-05  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-09-13  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Ree6-Applications/Ree6/security/advisories/GHSA-v574-xgcf-5w8x", "ref_desc": "Cross-Server-Channel Exploit \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Ree6-Applications/Ree6 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Ree6-Applications/Ree6/commit/459b5bc24f0ea27e50031f563373926e94b9aa0a", "ref_desc": "Removed News-Channel. \u00b7 Ree6-Applications/Ree6@459b5bc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
