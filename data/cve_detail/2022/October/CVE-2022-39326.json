{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39326", "Description": "kartverket/github-workflows are shared reusable workflows for GitHub Actions. Prior to version 2.7.5, all users of the `run-terraform` reusable workflow from the kartverket/github-workflows repo are affected by a code injection vulnerability. A malicious actor could potentially send a PR with a malicious payload leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the workflow. Users should upgrade to at least version 2.7.5 to resolve the issue. As a workaround, review any pull requests from external users for malicious payloads before allowing them to trigger a build.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39326", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKartverket\u00bbGithub-workflowsVersions  before (<) 2.7.5cpe:2.3:a:kartverket:github-workflows:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.20%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-08-13  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-14  0.23%  0.23%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-06-15  0.18%  0.23%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-06-01  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-04-06  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-01  0.09%  0.16%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-09-25  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-09-01  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.06%  -2.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/releases/tag/v2.7.5", "ref_desc": "Release v2.7.5 \u00b7 kartverket/github-workflows \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/pull/19", "ref_desc": "Sanitize usage of terraform output by esphen \u00b7 Pull Request #19 \u00b7 kartverket/github-workflows \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-f9qj-7gh3-mhj4", "ref_desc": "run-terraform allows for RCE via terraform plan \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kartverket/github-workflows \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
