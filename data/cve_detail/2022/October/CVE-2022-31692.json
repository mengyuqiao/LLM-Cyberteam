{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31692", "Description": "Spring Security, versions 5.7 prior to 5.7.5 and 5.6 prior to 5.6.9 could be susceptible to authorization rules bypass via forward or include dispatcher types. Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true: The application expects that Spring Security applies security to forward and include dispatcher types. The application uses the AuthorizationFilter either manually or via the authorizeHttpRequests() method. The application configures the FilterChainProxy to apply to forward and/or include requests (e.g. spring.security.filter.dispatcher-types = request, error, async, forward, include). The application may forward or include the request to a higher privilege-secured endpoint.The application configures Spring Security to apply to every dispatcher type via authorizeHttpRequests().shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes(true)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31692", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbSpring SecurityVersions  from including (>=) 5.6.0andbefore (<) 5.6.9cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbSpring SecurityVersions  from including (>=) 5.7.0andbefore (<) 5.7.5cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbActive Iq Unified Manager\u00bbVersion:N/AForVmware Vspherecpe:2.3:a:netapp:active_iq_unified_manager:-:*:*:*:*:vmware_vsphere:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbActive Iq Unified Manager\u00bbVersion:N/AForWindowscpe:2.3:a:netapp:active_iq_unified_manager:-:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-08  0.21%  0.13%  -0.08 \n 3  2024-05-23  0.28%  0.21%  -0.07 \n 4  2024-04-12  0.48%  0.28%  -0.20 \n 5  2024-03-16  0.90%  0.48%  -0.43 \n 6  2024-01-10  1.28%  0.90%  -0.37 \n 7  2023-12-03  1.61%  1.28%  -0.33 \n 8  2023-11-07  2.89%  1.61%  -1.28 \n 9  2023-10-01  3.08%  2.89%  -0.20 \n 10  2023-03-07  9.03%  3.08%  -5.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221215-0010/", "ref_desc": "October 2022 Spring Security Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/87GAerix52FCTYQSVlWVdflcvXw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-31692", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-31692 | Security | VMware TanzuMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
