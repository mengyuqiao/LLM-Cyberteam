{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-40202", "Description": "The database backup function in Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master Versions 00.00.01a and prior lacks proper authentication. An attacker could provide malicious serialized objects which, when deserialized, could activate an opcode for a backup scheduling function without authentication. This function allows the user to designate all function arguments and the file to be executed. This could allow the attacker to start any new process and achieve remote code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40202", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDeltaww\u00bbInfrasuite Device MasterVersions  before (<) 00.00.02acpe:2.3:a:deltaww:infrasuite_device_master:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.65% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.65%  +0.23 \n 2  2024-10-15  0.39%  0.42%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-07  0.37%  0.39%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-23  0.35%  0.37%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-12  0.39%  0.35%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-12-03  0.42%  0.39%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-11-20  0.36%  0.42%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-11-07  0.35%  0.36%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-10-01  0.30%  0.35%  +0.05 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.30%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-298-07", "ref_desc": "Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master | CISAPatch;Third Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wzqcWBfmah9bVDG1KJvAZHtvryQ.html"}]}
