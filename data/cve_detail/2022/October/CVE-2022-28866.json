{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-28866", "Description": "Multiple Improper Access Control was discovered in Nokia AirFrame BMC Web GUI < R18 Firmware v4.13.00. It does not properly validate requests for access to (or editing of) data and functionality in all endpoints under /#settings/* and /api/settings/*. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages, with sensitive data, that are not allowed, and modify system configurations also causing DoS, which should be accessed only by user with administration profile, bypassing all controls (without checking for user identity).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28866", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNokia\u00bbAirframe Bmc Web Gui R18 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.13.00cpe:2.3:o:nokia:airframe_bmc_web_gui_r18_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-03  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-23  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-18  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-11  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/it/innovazione/cybersecurity/red-team.html", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability Research & Advisor | Gruppo TIMExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0rIwMQrp8fM4UySF1enUVZfgL-c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gruppotim.it/it/footer/red-team.html", "ref_desc": "Gruppo TIM | Vulnerability Research & AdvisorExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XrlIPKmMGELvUtCD3VdurSZEDDM.html"}]}
