{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39310", "Description": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 can allow one authenticated agent to impersonate another agent, and thus receive work packages for other agents due to broken access control and incorrect validation of agent tokens within the GoCD server. Since work packages can contain sensitive information such as credentials intended only for a given job running against a specific agent environment, this can cause accidental information disclosure. Exploitation requires knowledge of agent identifiers and ability to authenticate as an existing agent with the GoCD server. This issue is fixed in GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39310", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  before (<) 21.1.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-06  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-26  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 3  2023-10-21  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-09-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/8877", "ref_desc": "Authorize agents remoting by UUID by marques-work \u00b7 Pull Request #8877 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-4fp5-33jh-hgcq", "ref_desc": "Malicious agent able to impersonate another agent due to improper access control \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#21-1-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o9r7AsjEyNOunbgGkWnJI8usIu0.html"}]}
