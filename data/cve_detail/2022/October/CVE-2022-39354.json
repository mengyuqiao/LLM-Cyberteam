{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39354", "Description": "SputnikVM, also called evm, is a Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. A custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static` parameter to determine if the call is executed in a static context (via `STATICCALL`), and thus decide if stateful operations should be done. Prior to version 0.36.0, the passed `is_static` parameter was incorrect -- it was only set to `true` if the call came from a direct `STATICCALL` opcode. However, once a static call context is entered, it should stay static. The issue only impacts custom precompiles that actually uses `is_static`. For those affected, the issue can lead to possible incorrect state transitions. Version 0.36.0 contains a patch. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39354", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEvm Project\u00bbEVM\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.36.0cpe:2.3:a:evm_project:evm:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/security/advisories/GHSA-hhc4-47rh-cr34", "ref_desc": "Incorrect is_static parameter for custom stateful precompiles \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-blockchain/evm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/pull/133", "ref_desc": "Allow is_static to be passed to precompiles by sorpaas \u00b7 Pull Request #133 \u00b7 rust-blockchain/evm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
