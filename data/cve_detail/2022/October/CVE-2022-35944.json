{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35944", "Description": "October is a self-hosted Content Management System (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. This vulnerability only affects installations that rely on the safe mode restriction, commonly used when providing public access to the admin panel. Assuming an attacker has access to the admin panel and permission to open the \"Editor\" section, they can bypass the Safe Mode (`cms.safe_mode`) restriction to introduce new PHP code in a CMS template using a specially crafted request. The issue has been patched in versions 2.2.34 and 3.0.66.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35944", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.00andbefore (<) 3.0.66cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  before (<) 2.2.34cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-05  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-20  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-x4q7-m6fp-4v9v", "ref_desc": "Safe Mode bypass leads to authenticated Remote Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
