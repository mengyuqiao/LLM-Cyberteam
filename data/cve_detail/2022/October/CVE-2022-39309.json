{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39309", "Description": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 leak the symmetric key used to encrypt/decrypt any secure variables/secrets in GoCD configuration to authenticated agents. A malicious/compromised agent may then expose that key from memory, and potentially allow an attacker the ability to decrypt secrets intended for other agents/environments if they also are able to obtain access to encrypted configuration values from the GoCD server. This issue is fixed in GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39309", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  before (<) 21.1.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-21  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-09-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-499 Serializable Class Containing Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/499/Serializable-Class-Containing-Sensitive-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/21.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release GoCD 21.1.0 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-f9qg-xcxq-cgv9", "ref_desc": "Server secret encryption/decryption key accidentally leaked to agents during material serialization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#21-1-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o9r7AsjEyNOunbgGkWnJI8usIu0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/691b479f1310034992da141760e9c5d1f5b60e8a", "ref_desc": "SCMMaterial changes #000 \u00b7 gocd/gocd@691b479 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
