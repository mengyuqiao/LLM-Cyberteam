{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39064", "Description": "An attacker sending a single malformed IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) frame makes the TR\u00c5DFRI bulb blink, and if they replay (i.e. resend) the same frame multiple times, the bulb performs a factory reset. This causes the bulb to lose configuration information about the Zigbee network and current brightness level. After this attack, all lights are on with full brightness, and a user cannot control the bulbs with either the IKEA Home Smart app or the TR\u00c5DFRI remote control. The malformed Zigbee frame is an unauthenticated broadcast message, which means all vulnerable devices within radio range are affected.
