{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39270", "Description": "DiscoTOC is a Discourse theme component that generates a table of contents for topics. Users that can create topics in TOC-enabled categories (and have sufficient trust level - configured in component's settings) are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that topic's page. The issue has been fixed on the `main` branch. Admins can update the theme component through the admin UI (Customize -> Themes -> Components -> DiscoTOC -> Check for Updates). Alternatively, admins can temporarily disable the DiscoTOC theme component.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39270", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscotocVersions  before (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discotoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-09-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/DiscoTOC/security/advisories/GHSA-m44p-w923-w32h", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary HTML injection in table-of-contents theme component \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/DiscoTOC \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/DiscoTOC/commit/f80c215a283cd045d2a371403e6eba88b2911192", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Render TOC items as plain text (#44) \u00b7 discourse/DiscoTOC@f80c215 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
