{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39311", "Description": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 are vulnerable to remote code execution on the server from a malicious or compromised agent. The Spring RemoteInvocation endpoint exposed agent communication and allowed deserialization of arbitrary java objects, as well as subsequent remote code execution. Exploitation requires agent-level authentication, thus an attacker would need to either compromise an existing agent, its network communication or register a new agent to practically exploit this vulnerability. This issue is fixed in GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39311", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  before (<) 21.1.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.92%  0.61%  -0.31 \n 2  2024-08-02  0.87%  0.92%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-06-04  0.61%  0.87%  +0.26 \n 4  2024-05-21  0.58%  0.61%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-05-06  0.46%  0.58%  +0.13 \n 6  2023-11-16  0.46%  0.46%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-10-21  0.29%  0.46%  +0.17 \n 8  2023-10-10  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-09-26  0.23%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-09-14  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-08-21  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 12  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.17%  -4.40 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-2hjh-3p3p-8hcm", "ref_desc": "Compromised agents able to execute remote code on GoCD Server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/7b88b70d6f7f429562d5cab49a80ea856e34cdc8", "ref_desc": "Disable RMI endpoint by default \u00b7 gocd/gocd@7b88b70 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#21-1-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o9r7AsjEyNOunbgGkWnJI8usIu0.html"}]}
