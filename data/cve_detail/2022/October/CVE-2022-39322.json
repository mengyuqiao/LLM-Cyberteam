{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39322", "Description": "@keystone-6/core is a core package for Keystone 6, a content management system for Node.js. Starting with version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.3.1, users who expected their `multiselect` fields to use the field-level access control - if configured - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used. List-level access control is not affected. Field-level access control for fields other than `multiselect` are not affected. Version 2.3.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, stop using the `multiselect` field.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39322", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nKeystonejs\u00bbKeystone\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.3.1cpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.36%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-10-09  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-05-17  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 4  2024-04-06  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-11-27  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-11-01  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-09-25  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/commit/65c6ee3deef23605fc72b80230908696a7a65e7c", "ref_desc": "Fix multiselect field type not propagating common config options (#8007) \u00b7 keystonejs/keystone@65c6ee3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-6mhr-52mv-6v6f", "ref_desc": "Field-level access-control bypass for multiselect field \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 keystonejs/keystone \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
