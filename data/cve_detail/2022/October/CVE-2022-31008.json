{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31008", "Description": "RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. In affected versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI obfuscation in their worker (link) state. The encryption key used to encrypt the URI was seeded with a predictable secret. This means that in case of certain exceptions related to Shovel and Federation plugins, reasonably easily deobfuscatable data could appear in the node log. Patched versions correctly use a cluster-wide secret for that purpose. This issue has been addressed and Patched versions: `3.10.2`, `3.9.18`, `3.8.32` are available. Users unable to upgrade should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31008", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbRabbitmqVersions  from including (>=) 3.10.0andbefore (<) 3.10.2cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbRabbitmqVersions  from including (>=) 3.9.0andbefore (<) 3.9.18cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbRabbitmqVersions  before (<) 3.8.32cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-28  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.13%  0.10%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-10-13  0.15%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-09-06  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-07-22  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-335 Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/335/Incorrect-Usage-of-Seeds-in-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4841", "ref_desc": "Implement fallback secret for credentials obfuscation (by @luos) by michaelklishin \u00b7 Pull Request #4841 \u00b7 rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/security/advisories/GHSA-v9gv-xp36-jgj8", "ref_desc": "Predictable credential obfuscation seed value used in Shovel and Federation plugins \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
