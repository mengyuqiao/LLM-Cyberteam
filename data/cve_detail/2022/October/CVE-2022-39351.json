{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39351", "Description": "Dependency-Track is a Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Prior to version 4.6.0, performing an API request using a valid API key with insufficient permissions causes the API key to be written to Dependency-Track's audit log in clear text. Actors with access to the audit log can exploit this flaw to gain access to valid API keys. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.6.0. Instead of logging the entire API key, only the last 4 characters of the key will be logged. It is strongly recommended to check historic logs for occurrences of this behavior, and re-generating API keys in case of leakage.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39351", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOwasp\u00bbDependency-trackVersions  before (<) 4.6.0cpe:2.3:a:owasp:dependency-track:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-gh7v-4hxp-gqp4", "ref_desc": "Logging of API keys in clear text when handling API requests using keys with insufficient permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DependencyTrack/dependency-track \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.dependencytrack.org/changelog/", "ref_desc": "Change Log | Dependency-TrackProduct;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FlOTttLns98aSxJDUmAJAFS06LM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/blob/4.5.0/src/main/docker/logback.xml", "ref_desc": "dependency-track/logback.xml at 4.5.0 \u00b7 DependencyTrack/dependency-track \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
