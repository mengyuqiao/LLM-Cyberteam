{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39297", "Description": "MelisCms provides a full CMS for Melis Platform, including templating system, drag'n'drop of plugins, SEO and many administration tools. Attackers can deserialize arbitrary data on affected versions of `melisplatform/melis-cms`, and ultimately leads to the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the system. Conducting this attack does not require authentication. Users should immediately upgrade to `melisplatform/melis-cms` >= 5.0.1. This issue was addressed by restricting allowed classes when deserializing user-controlled data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39297", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMelistechnology\u00bbMeliscmsVersions  before (<) 5.0.1cpe:2.3:a:melistechnology:meliscms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.41%  0.29%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-05-04  0.44%  0.41%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-03-24  0.29%  0.44%  +0.15 \n 4  2023-11-14  0.25%  0.29%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-10-19  0.16%  0.25%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-09-12  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.14%  -1.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-cms/security/advisories/GHSA-m3m3-6gww-7gj9", "ref_desc": "Deserialization of untrusted data in \\MelisCms\\Controller\\FrontPluginsController \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 melisplatform/melis-cms \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-cms/commit/d124b2474699a679a24ec52620cadceb3d4cec11", "ref_desc": "added allowed_classes=false param to unserialize func \u00b7 melisplatform/melis-cms@d124b24 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
