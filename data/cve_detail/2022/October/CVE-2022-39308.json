{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39308", "Description": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions from 19.2.0 to 19.10.0 (inclusive) are subject to a timing attack in validation of access tokens due to use of regular string comparison for validation of the token rather than a constant time algorithm. This could allow a brute force attack on GoCD server API calls to observe timing differences in validations in order to guess an access token generated by a user for API access. This issue is fixed in GoCD version 19.11.0. As a workaround, users can apply rate limiting or insert random delays to API calls made to GoCD Server via a reverse proxy or other fronting web server. Another workaround, users may disallow use of access tokens by users by having an administrator revoke all access tokens through the \"Access Token Management\" admin function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39308", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  from including (>=) 19.2.0andbefore (<) 19.11.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-06  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 2  2024-03-26  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-16  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/697/Incorrect-Comparison.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1254 Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1254/Incorrect-Comparison-Logic-Granularity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/19.11.0", "ref_desc": "Release GoCD 19.11.0 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#19-11-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-999p-fp84-jcpq", "ref_desc": "API authentication of user access tokens subject to timing attack during comparison \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/236d4baf92e6607f2841c151c855adcc477238b8", "ref_desc": "Access Token APIs (#5797) \u00b7 gocd/gocd@236d4ba \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
