{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24857", "Description": "django-mfa3 is a library that implements multi factor authentication for the django web framework. It achieves this by modifying the regular login view. Django however has a second login view for its admin area. This second login view was not modified, so the multi factor authentication can be bypassed. Users are affected if they have activated both django-mfa3 (< 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin and have not taken any other measures to prevent users from accessing the admin login view. The issue has been fixed in django-mfa3 0.5.0. It is possible to work around the issue by overwriting the admin login route, e.g. by adding the following URL definition *before* the admin routes: url('admin/login/', lambda request: redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24857", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDjango-mfa3 Project\u00bbDjango-mfa3Versions  before (<) 0.5.0cpe:2.3:a:django-mfa3_project:django-mfa3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-05  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-21  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-06  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-22  0.06%  0.12%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-03-28  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xi/django-mfa3/security/advisories/GHSA-3r7g-wrpr-j5g4", "ref_desc": "Multi factor authentication bypass via admin login \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xi/django-mfa3 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xi/django-mfa3/blob/main/CHANGES.md#050-2022-04-15", "ref_desc": "django-mfa3/CHANGES.md at main \u00b7 xi/django-mfa3 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xi/django-mfa3/commit/32f656e22df120b84bdf010e014bb19bd97971de", "ref_desc": "fix bypass via admin login \u00b7 xi/django-mfa3@32f656e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220609-0003/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-24857 Django Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
