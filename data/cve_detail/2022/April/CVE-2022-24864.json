{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24864", "Description": "Origin Protocol is a blockchain based project. The Origin Protocol project website allows for malicious users to inject malicious Javascript via a POST request to `/presale/join`. User-controlled data is passed with no sanitization to SendGrid and injected into an email that is delivered to the founders@originprotocol.com. If the email recipient is using an email program that is susceptible to XSS, then that email recipient will receive an email that may contain malicious XSS. Regardless if the email recipient\u2019s mail program has vulnerabilities or not, the hacker can at the very least inject malicious HTML that modifies the body content of the email. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24864", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOriginprotocol\u00bbOrigin WebsiteVersions  before (<) 2022-01-10cpe:2.3:a:originprotocol:origin_website:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-27  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-website/security/advisories/GHSA-v6fc-qwxx-m4h7", "ref_desc": "Malicious Javascript injection via a POST request to /presale/join \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OriginProtocol/origin-website \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/7127", "ref_desc": "Python: CWE-079 - Add Email injection query by mrthankyou \u00b7 Pull Request #7127 \u00b7 github/codeql \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-website/pull/617", "ref_desc": "Remove presale join endpoint by DanielVF \u00b7 Pull Request #617 \u00b7 OriginProtocol/origin-website \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
