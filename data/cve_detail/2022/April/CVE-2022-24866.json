{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24866", "Description": "Discourse Assign is a plugin for assigning users to a topic in Discourse, an open-source messaging platform. Prior to version 1.0.1, the UserBookmarkSerializer serialized the whole User / Group object, which leaked some private information. The data was only being serialized to people who could view assignment info, which is limited to staff by default. For the vast majority of sites, this data was only leaked to trusted staff member, but for sites with assign features enabled publicly, the data was accessible to more people than just staff. Version 1.0.1 contains a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24866", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbAssign\u00bbForDiscourseVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:assign:*:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-assign/security/advisories/GHSA-9xhf-wvjx-f5w9", "ref_desc": "Secure assigned user/group private info leaked via bookmark serializer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-assign \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-assign/pull/320", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: do not expose user/group info by janzenisaac \u00b7 Pull Request #320 \u00b7 discourse/discourse-assign \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
