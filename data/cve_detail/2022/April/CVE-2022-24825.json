{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24825", "Description": "Smokescreen is a simple HTTP proxy that fogs over naughty URLs. The primary use case for Smokescreen is to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks in which external attackers leverage the behavior of applications to connect to or scan internal infrastructure. Smokescreen also offers an option to deny access to additional (e.g., external) URLs by way of a deny list. There was an issue in Smokescreen that made it possible to bypass the deny list feature by appending a dot to the end of user-supplied URLs, or by providing input in a different letter case. Recommended to upgrade Smokescreen to version 0.0.3 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24825", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nStripe\u00bbSmokescreenVersions  before (<) 0.0.3cpe:2.3:a:stripe:smokescreen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-10  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-20  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen/security/advisories/GHSA-gcj7-j438-hjj2", "ref_desc": "Smokescreen SSRF via deny list bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 stripe/smokescreen \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen", "ref_desc": "GitHub - stripe/smokescreen: A simple HTTP proxy that fogs over naughty URLsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
