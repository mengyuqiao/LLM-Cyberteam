{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-25165", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25165", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbAws Client Vpn\u00bbVersion:2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:aws_client_vpn:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-11-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/CVEs", "ref_desc": "GitHub - RhinoSecurityLabs/CVEs: A collection of proof-of-concept exploit scripts written by the team at Rhino Security Labs for various CVEs.Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iWQb6XL52e09qFwFd845e610vXM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/cve-2022-25165-aws-vpn-client/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-25165: Privilege Escalation to SYSTEM in AWS VPN Client - Rhino Security LabsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rnA5JUts-5RdDfkbv4tKnJdPwdg.html"}]}
