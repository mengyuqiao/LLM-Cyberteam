{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24788", "Description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. Versions of vyper prior to 0.3.2 suffer from a potential buffer overrun. Importing a function from a JSON interface which returns `bytes` generates bytecode which does not clamp bytes length, potentially resulting in a buffer overrun. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24788", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyperVersions  before (<) 0.3.2cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-05  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-09-24  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-16  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-20  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-14  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-4mrx-6fxm-8jpg", "ref_desc": "No bytes clamps for interfaces imported via JSON \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/049dbdc647b2ce838fae7c188e6bb09cf16e470b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-j2x6-9323-fp7h \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@049dbdc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yYS-eeZJES04j37V282P_RRDOrk.html"}]}
