{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-27139", "Description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the file upload module of Ghost v4.39.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted SVG file. NOTE: Vendor states that as outlined in Ghost's security documentation, upload of SVGs is only possible by trusted authenticated users. The uploading of SVG files to Ghost does not represent a remote code execution vulnerability. SVGs are not executable on the server, and may only execute javascript in a client's browser - this is expected and intentional functionality", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27139", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGhost\u00bbGhost\u00bbVersion:4.39.0ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:ghost:ghost:4.39.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.66%  0.57%  -0.09 \n 2  2024-11-16  0.49%  0.66%  +0.17 \n 3  2024-09-24  0.47%  0.49%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-27  0.42%  0.47%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-02-08  0.27%  0.42%  +0.14 \n 6  2023-11-03  0.27%  0.27%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-09-23  0.28%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-05-15  0.26%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-04-19  0.16%  0.26%  +0.10 \n 10  2023-03-13  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.77%  0.14%  -1.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://ghost.org/docs/security/#privilege-escalation-attacks", "ref_desc": "Security and Privacy", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://youtu.be/FCqWEvir2wE", "ref_desc": "Before you continue to YouTubeExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
