{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20773", "Description": "A vulnerability in the key-based SSH authentication mechanism of Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance (VA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate a VA. This vulnerability is due to the presence of a static SSH host key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a man-in-the-middle attack on an SSH connection to the Umbrella VA. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to learn the administrator credentials, change configurations, or reload the VA. Note: SSH is not enabled by default on the Umbrella VA.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20773", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUmbrellaVersions  before (<) 3.3.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:umbrella:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  0.22%  0.21%  0.00 \n 2  2024-07-12  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-04  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-12  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-10-02  0.18%  0.17%  0.00 \n 6  2023-05-24  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 7  2023-04-28  0.11%  0.18%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-03-22  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.10%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-uva-static-key-6RQTRs4c", "ref_desc": "Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance Static SSH Host Key VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
