{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24847", "Description": "GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. The GeoServer security mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. The same can happen while configuring data stores with data sources located in JNDI, or while setting up the disk quota mechanism. In order to perform any of the above changes, the attack needs to have obtained admin rights and use either the GeoServer GUI, or its REST API. The lookups are going to be restricted in GeoServer 2.21.0, 2.20.4, 1.19.6. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to the `geoserver/web` and `geoserver/rest` via a firewall and ensure that the GeoWebCache is not remotely accessible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24847", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nOsgeo\u00bbGeoserverVersions  before (<) 2.19.6cpe:2.3:a:osgeo:geoserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOsgeo\u00bbGeoserverVersions  from including (>=) 2.20.0andbefore (<) 2.20.4cpe:2.3:a:osgeo:geoserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-11-05  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-09-24  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.09%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-04-20  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.05%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-917 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/917/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-Expre.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-4pm3-f52j-8ggh", "ref_desc": "Improper Input Validation and Uncontrolled Resource Consumption and Deserialization of Untrusted Data in GeoServer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 geoserver/geoserver \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
