{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20739", "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user. The attacker must be authenticated on the affected system as a low-privileged user to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because a file leveraged by a root user is executed when a low-privileged user runs specific commands on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands to a specific file as a lower-privileged user and then waiting until an admin user executes specific commands. The commands would then be executed on the device by the root user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected system from a low-privileged user to the root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20739", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan VmanageVersions  before (<) 20.6.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan_vmanage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCatalyst Sd-wan Manager\u00bbVersion:20.7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:catalyst_sd-wan_manager:20.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-privesc-vman-tEJFpBSL", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
