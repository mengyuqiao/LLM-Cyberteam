{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24845", "Description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In affected versions, the return of `<iface>.returns_int128()` is not validated to fall within the bounds of `int128`. This issue can result in a misinterpretation of the integer value and lead to incorrect behavior. As of v0.3.0, `<iface>.returns_int128()` is validated in simple expressions, but not complex expressions. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24845", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyperVersions  before (<) 0.3.2cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.26%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-17  0.19%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-11-05  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-24  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-16  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-04-20  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-14  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-j2x6-9323-fp7h", "ref_desc": "external calls are not clamped in certain complex expressions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/049dbdc647b2ce838fae7c188e6bb09cf16e470b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-j2x6-9323-fp7h \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@049dbdc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yYS-eeZJES04j37V282P_RRDOrk.html"}]}
