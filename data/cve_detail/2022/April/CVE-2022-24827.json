{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24827", "Description": "Elide is a Java library that lets you stand up a GraphQL/JSON-API web service with minimal effort. When leveraging the following together: Elide Aggregation Data Store for Analytic Queries, Parameterized Columns (A column that requires a client provided parameter), and a parameterized column of type TEXT. There is the potential for a hacker to provide a carefully crafted query that would bypass server side authorization filters through SQL injection. A recent patch to Elide 6.1.2 allowed the '-' character to be included in parameterized TEXT columns. This character can be interpreted as SQL comments ('--') and allow the attacker to remove the WHERE clause from the generated query and bypass authorization filters. A fix is provided in Elide 6.1.4. The vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type TEXT and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted). Workarounds include leveraging a different type of parameterized column (TIME, MONEY, etc) or not leveraging parameterized columns.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24827", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nElide\u00bbElide\u00bbVersion:6.1.3cpe:2.3:a:elide:elide:6.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.19%  0.19%  0.00 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-02  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-22  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-14  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-04-18  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-03-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yahoo/elide/releases/tag/6.1.4", "ref_desc": "Release 6.1.4 \u00b7 yahoo/elide \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yahoo/elide/pull/2581", "ref_desc": "Revert \"Update: Make `-` a valid TEXT value type character\" by aklish \u00b7 Pull Request #2581 \u00b7 yahoo/elide \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yahoo/elide/security/advisories/GHSA-8xpj-9j9g-fc9r", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') in elide-datastore-aggregation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yahoo/elide \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
