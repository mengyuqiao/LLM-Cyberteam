{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24850", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. A category's group permissions settings can be viewed by anyone that has access to the category. As a result, a normal user is able to see whether a group has read/write permissions in the category even though the information should only be available to the users that can manage a category. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. There are no workarounds for this problem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24850", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  before (<) 2.8.2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-11-05  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-04-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-34xr-ff4w-mcpf", "ref_desc": "Category group permissions leaked to users that cannot edit a category \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
