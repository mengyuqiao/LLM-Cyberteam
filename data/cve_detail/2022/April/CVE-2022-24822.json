{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24822", "Description": "Podium is a library for building micro frontends. @podium/layout is a module for building a Podium layout server, and @podium/proxy is a module for proxying HTTP requests from a layout server to a podlet server. In @podium/layout prior to version 4.6.110 and @podium/proxy prior to version 4.2.74, an attacker using the `Trailer` header as part of the request against proxy endpoints has the ability to take down the server. All Podium layouts that include podlets with proxy endpoints are affected. `@podium/layout`, which is the main way developers/users are vulnerable to this exploit, has been patched in version `4.6.110`. All earlier versions are vulnerable.`@podium/proxy`, which is the source of the vulnerability and is used by `@podium/layout` has been patched in version `4.2.74`. All earlier versions are vulnerable. It is not easily possible to work around this issue without upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24822", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFinn\u00bbPodium Layout\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.6.110cpe:2.3:a:finn:podium_layout:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nFinn\u00bbPodium Proxy\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.2.74cpe:2.3:a:finn:podium_proxy:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-15  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-11-26  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-12  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-28  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 6  2023-09-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-07-12  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-05-09  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-04-13  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/podium-lib/layout/releases/tag/v4.6.110", "ref_desc": "Release v4.6.110 \u00b7 podium-lib/layout \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/podium-lib/layout/commit/fe43e655432b0a5f07b6475f67babcc2588fb039", "ref_desc": "fix: update Proxy module to fix trailer header vulnerability \u00b7 podium-lib/layout@fe43e65 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/podium-lib/proxy/commit/9698a40df081217ce142d4de71f929baaa339cdf", "ref_desc": "fix: remove trailer header if present when proxying \u00b7 podium-lib/proxy@9698a40 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/podium-lib/proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-3hjg-vc7r-rcrw", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service vulnerability in @podium/layout and @podium/proxy \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 podium-lib/proxy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/podium-lib/proxy/releases/tag/v4.2.74", "ref_desc": "Release v4.2.74 \u00b7 podium-lib/proxy \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
