{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24859", "Description": "PyPDF2 is an open source python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. In versions prior to 1.27.5 an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if the PyPDF2 if the code attempts to get the content stream. The reason is that the last while-loop in `ContentStream._readInlineImage` only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended. This issue has been resolved in version `1.27.5`. Users unable to upgrade should validate and PDFs prior to iterating over their content stream.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24859", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPypdf2 Project\u00bbPypdf2Versions  before (<) 1.27.5cpe:2.3:a:pypdf2_project:pypdf2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-07-10  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-08  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-24  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-09  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-07-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-06-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-05-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.04%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/security/advisories/GHSA-xcjx-m2pj-8g79", "ref_desc": "Manipulated inline images can cause Infinite Loop \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 py-pdf/PyPDF2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00013.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3451-1] pypdf2 security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/issues/329", "ref_desc": "Manipulated inline images can force PyPDF2 into an infinite loop \u00b7 Issue #329 \u00b7 py-pdf/PyPDF2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/releases/tag/1.27.5", "ref_desc": "Release Version 1.27.5, 2022-04-15 \u00b7 py-pdf/PyPDF2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/pull/740", "ref_desc": "Improved performance and security for ContentStream_readInlineImage. by sekrause \u00b7 Pull Request #740 \u00b7 py-pdf/PyPDF2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/06/msg00001.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3039-1] pypdf2 security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
