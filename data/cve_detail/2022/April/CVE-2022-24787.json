{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24787", "Description": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In version 0.3.1 and prior, bytestrings can have dirty bytes in them, resulting in the word-for-word comparisons giving incorrect results. Even without dirty nonzero bytes, two bytestrings can compare to equal if one ends with `\"\\x00\"` because there is no comparison of the length. A patch is available and expected to be part of the 0.3.2 release. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24787", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyperVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.3.1cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-18  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-26  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/697/Incorrect-Comparison.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/2c73f8352635c0a433423a5b94740de1a118e508", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7vrm-3jc8-5wwm \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@2c73f83 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-7vrm-3jc8-5wwm", "ref_desc": "bytestring equality incorrect for Bytes[N<=32] \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
