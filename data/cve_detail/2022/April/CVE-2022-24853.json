{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24853", "Description": "Metabase is an open source business intelligence and analytics application. Metabase has a proxy to load arbitrary URLs for JSON maps as part of our GeoJSON support. While we do validation to not return contents of arbitrary URLs, there is a case where a particularly crafted request could result in file access on windows, which allows enabling an `NTLM relay attack`, potentially allowing an attacker to receive the system password hash. If you use Windows and are on this version of Metabase, please upgrade immediately. The following patches (or greater versions) are available: 0.42.4 and 1.42.4, 0.41.7 and 1.41.7, 0.40.8 and 1.40.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24853", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.42.0andbefore (<) 1.42.4cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.41.0andbefore (<) 1.41.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.41.0andbefore (<) 0.41.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.40.0andbefore (<) 1.40.8cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.40.0andbefore (<) 0.40.8cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.42.0andbefore (<) 0.42.4cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-11-18  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-06  0.11%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-11-05  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 5  2023-09-25  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-21  0.07%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.qomplx.com/qomplx-knowledge-ntlm-relay-attacks-explained/", "ref_desc": "NTLM Relay Attacks Explained - Blog | QOMPLXThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://secure77.de/metabase-ntlm-relay-attack/", "ref_desc": "NTLM Attack in Metabase CVE-2022-24853 - Secure77Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-5cfq-582c-c38m", "ref_desc": "Make GeoJSON URL read fully conditional on validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
