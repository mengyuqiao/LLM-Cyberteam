{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24875", "Description": "The CVEProject/cve-services is an open source project used to operate the CVE services api. In versions up to and including 1.1.1 the `org.conroller.js` code would erroneously log user secrets. This has been resolved in commit `46d98f2b` and should be available in subsequent versions of the software. Users of the software are advised to manually apply the `46d98f2b` commit or to update when a new version becomes available. As a workaround users should inspect their logs and remove logged secrets as appropriate.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24875", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCVE\u00bbCve-servicesVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:cve:cve-services:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-11-25  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-12  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-02  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-24  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-28  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-22  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/security/advisories/GHSA-rhj9-qx37-7m2m", "ref_desc": "Potential Secrets being logged to disk (1) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CVEProject/cve-services \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/commit/46d98f2b1427fc6ba1c2bc443dc6688fd400f1f4", "ref_desc": "Fixed secret logging \u00b7 CVEProject/cve-services@46d98f2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
