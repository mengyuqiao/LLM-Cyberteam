{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-28743", "Description": "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28743", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFoscam\u00bbR2c Application FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.91.2.66cpe:2.3:o:foscam:r2c_application_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Foscam\u00bbR2C\u00bbVersion:N/A\nFoscam\u00bbR2c System FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.13.1.6cpe:2.3:o:foscam:r2c_system_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Foscam\u00bbR2C\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.19%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-13  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-05  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-12  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-04-28  0.10%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-03-22  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/keeping-a-critical-eye-on-iot-devices.html", "ref_desc": "Keeping A Critical Eye on IoT DevicesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
