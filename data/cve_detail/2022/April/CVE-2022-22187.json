{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-22187", "Description": "An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in the Windows Installer framework used in the Juniper Networks Juniper Identity Management Service (JIMS) allows an unprivileged user to trigger a repair operation. Running a repair operation, in turn, will trigger a number of file operations in the %TEMP% folder of the user triggering the repair. Some of these operations will be performed from a SYSTEM context (started via the Windows Installer service), including the execution of temporary files. An attacker may be able to provide malicious binaries to the Windows Installer, which will be executed with high privilege, leading to a local privilege escalation. This issue affects Juniper Networks Juniper Identity Management Service (JIMS) versions prior to 1.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22187", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nJuniper\u00bbIdentity Management Service\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:juniper:identity_management_service:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.04%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kb.juniper.net/JSA69495", "ref_desc": "2022-04 Security Bulletin: JIMS: Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability via repair functionality (CVE-2022-22187)Permissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mandiant/Vulnerability-Disclosures/blob/master/2022/MNDT-2022-0029/MNDT-2022-0029.md", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability-Disclosures/MNDT-2022-0029.md at master \u00b7 mandiant/Vulnerability-Disclosures \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
