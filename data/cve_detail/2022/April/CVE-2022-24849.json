{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24849", "Description": "DisCatSharp is a Discord API wrapper for .NET. Users of versions 9.8.5, 9.8.6, 9.9.0 and previously published prereleases of 10.0.0 who have used either one of the two `RequireDisCatSharpDeveloperAttribute`s or the `BaseDiscordClient.LibraryDeveloperTeam` have potentially had their bot token sent to a web server not affiliated with Discord. This server is owned and operated by DisCatSharp's development team. The tokens were not logged, yet it is still advisable to reset the tokens of potentially affected bots. 9.9.1 has been released to patch the issue for the current stable release and the current 10.0.0 prereleases are also no longer affected. Users unable to upgrade should remove all uses of the two `RequireDisCatSharpDeveloperAttribute`s and all direct calls to `BaseDiscordClient.LibraryDeveloperTeam`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24849", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nAitsys\u00bbDiscatsharpVersions  from including (>=) 9.8.5andbefore (<) 9.9.1cpe:2.3:a:aitsys:discatsharp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-11-18  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-05  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-25  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-21  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-15  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Aiko-IT-Systems/DisCatSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-frxg-hf44-q765", "ref_desc": "Contact to DisCatSharp-owned server using authenticated client \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Aiko-IT-Systems/DisCatSharp \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
