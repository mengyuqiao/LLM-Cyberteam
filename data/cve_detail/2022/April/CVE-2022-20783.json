{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20783", "Description": "A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted H.323 traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to either reboot normally or reboot into maintenance mode, which could result in a DoS condition on the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20783", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRoomosVersions  before (<) 2022cpe:2.3:o:cisco:roomos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Collaboration EndpointVersions  before (<) 9.15.10.8cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_collaboration_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Collaboration EndpointVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0.0andbefore (<) 10.11.2.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_collaboration_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-12  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-02  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-28  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-22  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1287 Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1287/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Type-of-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ce-roomos-dos-c65x2Qf2", "ref_desc": "Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint and RoomOS Software H.323 Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
