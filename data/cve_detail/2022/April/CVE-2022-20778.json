{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20778", "Description": "A vulnerability in the authentication component of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the authentication component of Cisco Webex Meetings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20778", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-12  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-02  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-28  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-03-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-xss-w47AMqAk", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Meetings Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
