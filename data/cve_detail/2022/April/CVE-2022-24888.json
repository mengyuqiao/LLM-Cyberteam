{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24888", "Description": "Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to versions 20.0.14.4, 21.0.8, 22.2.4, and 23.0.1, it is possible to create files and folders that have leading and trailing \\n, \\r, \\t, and \\v characters. The server rejects files and folders that have these characters in the middle of their names, so this might be an opportunity for injection. This issue is fixed in versions 20.0.14.4, 21.0.8, 22.2.4, and 23.0.1. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24888", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 20.0.14.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 22.0.0andbefore (<) 22.2.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 23.0.0andbefore (<) 23.0.1cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.0andbefore (<) 21.0.8cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.11%  -0.05 \n 2  2023-11-18  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-05-17  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-04  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-17) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jZHo9JiHBzcYnpiDroWdMBiDUSQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-w3h6-p64h-q9jp", "ref_desc": "Control character filtering misses leading and trailing whitespace in file and folder names \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/29895", "ref_desc": "Check for invalid characters before trimming by nickvergessen \u00b7 Pull Request #29895 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1402249", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
