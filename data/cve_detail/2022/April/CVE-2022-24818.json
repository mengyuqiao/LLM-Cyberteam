{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24818", "Description": "GeoTools is an open source Java library that provides tools for geospatial data. The GeoTools library has a number of data sources that can perform unchecked JNDI lookups, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. Similar to the Log4J case, the vulnerability can be triggered if the JNDI names are user-provided, but requires admin-level login to be triggered. The lookups are now restricted in GeoTools 26.4, GeoTools 25.6, and GeoTools 24.6. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any downstream application should not allow usage of remotely provided JNDI strings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24818", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGeotools\u00bbGeotoolsVersions  from including (>=) 26.0andbefore (<) 26.4cpe:2.3:a:geotools:geotools:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGeotools\u00bbGeotoolsVersions  from including (>=) 25.0andbefore (<) 25.6cpe:2.3:a:geotools:geotools:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGeotools\u00bbGeotoolsVersions  before (<) 24.6cpe:2.3:a:geotools:geotools:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-11-05  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-09-24  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-10  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-04-20  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.28%  0.06%  -2.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-917 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/917/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-Expre.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/geotools/geotools/commit/4f70fa3234391dd0cda883a20ab0ec75688cba49", "ref_desc": "[GEOT-7115] Streamline JNDI lookups \u00b7 geotools/geotools@4f70fa3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/geotools/geotools/security/advisories/GHSA-jvh2-668r-g75x", "ref_desc": "Unchecked JNDI lookups in GeoTools \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 geotools/geotools \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
