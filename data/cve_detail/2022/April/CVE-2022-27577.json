{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-27577", "Description": "The vulnerability in the MSC800 in all versions before 4.15 allows for an attacker to predict the TCP initial sequence number. When the TCP sequence is predictable, an attacker can send packets that are forged to appear to come from a trusted computer. These forged packets could compromise services on the MSC800. SICK has released a new firmware version of the SICK MSC800 and recommends updating to the newest version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27577", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSick\u00bbMsc800 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.15cpe:2.3:o:sick:msc800_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Sick\u00bbMsc800\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-02  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-22  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-14  0.16%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-04-18  0.10%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-03-12  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-342 Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/342/Predictable-Exact-Value-from-Previous-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sick.com/psirt", "ref_desc": "The SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT) | SICKVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v6inTk1Bf2cm1HoZcfS_iK5G0TQ.html"}]}
