{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-28345", "Description": "The Signal app before 5.34 for iOS allows URI spoofing via RTLO injection. It incorrectly renders RTLO encoded URLs beginning with a non-breaking space, when there is a hash character in the URL. This technique allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send legitimate looking links, appearing to be any website URL, by abusing the non-http/non-https automatic rendering of URLs. An attacker can spoof, for example, example.com, and masquerade any URL with a malicious destination. An attacker requires a subdomain such as gepj, txt, fdp, or xcod, which would appear backwards as jpeg, txt, pdf, and docx respectively.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28345", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSignal\u00bbSignal\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 5.34cpe:2.3:a:signal:signal:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.55%  0.55%  0.00 \n 2  2024-11-19  0.40%  0.55%  +0.16 \n 3  2024-07-07  0.31%  0.40%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-11-06  0.26%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-26  0.24%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-18  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-04-22  0.15%  0.22%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-03-16  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.21%  0.14%  -1.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sick.codes/sick-2022-42", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-28345 - Signal client for iOS version 5.33.2 and below are vulnerable to RTLO Injection URI Spoofing using malicious URLs such as gepj.net/selif#/moc.elpmaxe which would appear as example.comExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering/2022/03/uri-spoofing-flaw-could-phish-whatsapp-signal-instagram-and-imessage-users/", "ref_desc": "URI spoofing flaw could phish WhatsApp, Signal, Instagram, and iMessage users | Malwarebytes LabsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sickcodes/security/blob/master/advisories/SICK-2022-42.md", "ref_desc": "security/SICK-2022-42.md at master \u00b7 sickcodes/security \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zadewg/RIUS", "ref_desc": "GitHub - zadewg/RIUS: RTLO Injection URI SpoofingThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ziq8NzRV3diGwfe4VtLXUvtwCvM.html"}]}
