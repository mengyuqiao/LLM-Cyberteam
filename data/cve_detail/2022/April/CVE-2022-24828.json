{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24828", "Description": "Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language. Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24828", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTenable\u00bbTenable.scVersions  before (<) 5.21.0cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetcomposer\u00bbComposerVersions  before (<) 1.10.26cpe:2.3:a:getcomposer:composer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetcomposer\u00bbComposerVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.5cpe:2.3:a:getcomposer:composer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetcomposer\u00bbComposerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.12cpe:2.3:a:getcomposer:composer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.28%  0.39%  +0.11 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-12-03  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-19  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.18%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-09-24  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-07-19  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-06-24  0.18%  0.14%  -0.04 \n 9  2023-05-16  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-04-20  0.09%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 11  2023-03-14  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.07%  -1.04 \n 13  2023-02-23  7.26%  1.11%  -6.15 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QD7JQWL6C4GVROO25DTXWYWM6BPOPPCG/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: composer-2.2.12-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/625MT3IKWKFVIWLSYZFSXHVUA2LES7YQ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: composer-2.3.5-1.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-09", "ref_desc": "[R1] Tenable.sc 5.21.0 Fixes Multiple Third-Party Vulnerabilities - Security Advisory | Tenable\u00aePatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FU7dEwKwV5NrDiF1XycOtSOh6aQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/2c40c53637c5c7e43fff7c09d3d324d632734709", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-x7cr-6qr6-2hh6 \u00b7 composer/composer@2c40c53 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-x7cr-6qr6-2hh6", "ref_desc": "Missing input validation can lead to command execution via VcsDriver::getFileContent() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 composer/composer \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GWT6LDSRY7SFMTDZWJ4MS2ZBXHL7VQEF/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: composer-2.3.5-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
