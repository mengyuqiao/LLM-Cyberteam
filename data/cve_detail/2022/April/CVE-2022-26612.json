{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26612", "Description": "In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26612", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbHadoopVersions  before (<) 3.2.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:hadoop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nApache\u00bbHadoop\u00bbVersion:3.3.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:hadoop:3.3.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nApache\u00bbHadoop\u00bbVersion:3.3.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:hadoop:3.3.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "3.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.82%  3.07%  +1.25 \n 2  2024-11-11  1.51%  1.82%  +0.31 \n 3  2023-10-29  1.52%  1.51%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-09-18  1.09%  1.52%  +0.44 \n 5  2023-08-22  1.07%  1.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-10  1.10%  1.07%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-04-14  0.55%  1.10%  +0.54 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.55%  -0.33 \n 9  2023-02-23  9.03%  0.89%  -8.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/hslo7wzw2449gv1jyjk8g6ttd7935fyz", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-26612: Apache Hadoop: Arbitrary file write in FileUtil#unpackEntries on Windows-Apache Mail ArchivesExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220519-0004/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-26612 Apache Hadoop Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
