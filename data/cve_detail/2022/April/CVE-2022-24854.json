{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24854", "Description": "Metabase is an open source business intelligence and analytics application. SQLite has an FDW-like feature called `ATTACH DATABASE`, which allows connecting multiple SQLite databases via the initial connection. If the attacker has SQL permissions to at least one SQLite database, then it can attach this database to a second database, and then it can query across all the tables. To be able to do that the attacker also needs to know the file path to the second database. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. If you're unable to upgrade, you can modify your SQLIte connection strings to contain the url argument `?limit_attached=0`, which will disallow making connections to other SQLite databases. Only users making use of SQLite are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24854", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.42.0andbefore (<) 1.42.4cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.41.0andbefore (<) 1.41.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.41.0andbefore (<) 0.41.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.42.0andbefore (<) 0.42.4cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-05  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-09-25  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-04-21  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-vm79-xvmp-7329", "ref_desc": "SQLite allows \"FDW\" to other SQLite databases bypassing any permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html", "ref_desc": "ATTACH DATABASEThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
