{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-25166", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. It is possible to include a UNC path in the OpenVPN configuration file when referencing file paths for parameters (such as auth-user-pass). When this file is imported and the client attempts to validate the file path, it performs an open operation on the path and leaks the user's Net-NTLMv2 hash to an external server. This could be exploited by having a user open a crafted malicious ovpn configuration file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25166", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbAws Client Vpn\u00bbVersion:2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:aws_client_vpn:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-11-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/CVEs", "ref_desc": "GitHub - RhinoSecurityLabs/CVEs: A collection of proof-of-concept exploit scripts written by the team at Rhino Security Labs for various CVEs.Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iWQb6XL52e09qFwFd845e610vXM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/cve-2022-25165-aws-vpn-client/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-25165: Privilege Escalation to SYSTEM in AWS VPN Client - Rhino Security LabsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rnA5JUts-5RdDfkbv4tKnJdPwdg.html"}]}
