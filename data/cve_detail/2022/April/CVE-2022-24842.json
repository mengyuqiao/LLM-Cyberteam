{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24842", "Description": "MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. A security issue was found where an non-admin user is able to create service accounts for root or other admin users and then is able to assume their access policies via the generated credentials. This in turn allows the user to escalate privilege to that of the root user. This vulnerability has been resolved in pull request #14729 and is included in `RELEASE.2022-04-12T06-55-35Z`. Users unable to upgrade may workaround this issue by explicitly adding a `admin:CreateServiceAccount` deny policy, however, this, in turn, denies the user the ability to create their own service accounts as well.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24842", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinioVersions  from including (>=) 2021-12-09t06-19-41zandbefore (<) 2022-04-12t06-55-35zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-04  0.22%  0.29%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-12-02  0.19%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-11-18  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-11-03  0.13%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-04-19  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-03-13  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/66b14a0d32684d527ae8018dc6d9d46ccce58ae3", "ref_desc": "Fix service account privilege escalation (#14729) \u00b7 minio/minio@66b14a0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/14729", "ref_desc": "Fix service account privilege escalation by donatello \u00b7 Pull Request #14729 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-2j69-jjmg-534q", "ref_desc": "Unprivileged user is able to create service accounts for root or other admin users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
