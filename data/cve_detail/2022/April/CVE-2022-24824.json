{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24824", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions an attacker can poison the cache for anonymous (i.e. not logged in) users, such that the users are shown the crawler view of the site instead of the HTML page. This can lead to a partial denial-of-service. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24824", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  before (<) 2.8.3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.9.0UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.9.0:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-05  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-25  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/b72b0dac10493d09f4f9eb8f3c3ce7817295e34e", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Ensure user-agent-based responses are cached separately (st\u2026 \u00b7 discourse/discourse@b72b0da \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-46v9-3jc4-f53w", "ref_desc": "Anonymous user cache poisoning via maliciously formed request \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
