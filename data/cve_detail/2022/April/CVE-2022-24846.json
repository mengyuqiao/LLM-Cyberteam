{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24846", "Description": "GeoWebCache is a tile caching server implemented in Java. The GeoWebCache disk quota mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. While in GeoWebCache the JNDI strings are provided via local configuration file, in GeoServer a user interface is provided to perform the same, that can be accessed remotely, and requires admin-level login to be used. These lookup are unrestricted in scope and can lead to code execution. The lookups are going to be restricted in GeoWebCache 1.21.0, 1.20.2, 1.19.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24846", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGeoserver\u00bbGeowebcacheVersions  from including (>=) 1.20.0andbefore (<) 1.20.2cpe:2.3:a:geoserver:geowebcache:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGeoserver\u00bbGeowebcacheVersions  before (<) 1.19.3cpe:2.3:a:geoserver:geowebcache:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-11-05  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-09-25  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 4  2023-04-21  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.05%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/GeoWebCache/geowebcache/security/advisories/GHSA-4v22-v8jp-438r", "ref_desc": "Unchecked JNDI lookups in GeoWebCache \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 GeoWebCache/geowebcache \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
