{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26850", "Description": "When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, Apache NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating system temporary directory. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which significantly limited the window of opportunity for access. NiFi 1.16.0 includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system temporary directory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26850", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbNifiVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.16.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:nifi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-04-02  0.05%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-03-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-28  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-05-09  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 6  2023-04-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2022-26850", "ref_desc": "Apache NiFi Security ReportsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/06/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2022-26850: Apache NiFi: Insufficiently protected credentialsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
