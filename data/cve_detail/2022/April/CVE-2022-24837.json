{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24837", "Description": "HedgeDoc is an open-source, web-based, self-hosted, collaborative markdown editor. Images uploaded with HedgeDoc version 1.9.1 and later have an enumerable filename after the upload, resulting in potential information leakage of uploaded documents. This is especially relevant for private notes and affects all upload backends, except Lutim and imgur. This issue is patched in version 1.9.3 by replacing the filename generation with UUIDv4. If you cannot upgrade to HedgeDoc 1.9.3, it is possible to block POST requests to `/uploadimage`, which will disable future uploads.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24837", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nHedgedoc\u00bbHedgedocVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.1andbefore (<) 1.9.3cpe:2.3:a:hedgedoc:hedgedoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-02  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-14  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-18  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-q6vv-2q26-j7rx", "ref_desc": "Enumerable upload file names \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/9e2f9e21e904c4a319e84265da7ef03b0a8e343a", "ref_desc": "fix(imageRouter): Fix enumerable image upload issue \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc@9e2f9e2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/issues/808", "ref_desc": "uniq filenames \u00b7 Issue #808 \u00b7 node-formidable/formidable \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
