{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20790", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the underlying operating system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20790", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 14.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bb     Session ManagementEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 14.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:session_management:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-12  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-02-21  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-12  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-28  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucm-file-read-h8h4HEJ3", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Communications Products Arbitrary File Read VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
