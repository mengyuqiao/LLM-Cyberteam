{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24880", "Description": "flask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session. In versions prior to 1.2.1, he `captcha.validate()` function would return `None` if passed no value (e.g. by submitting an having an empty form). If implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed. Version 1.2.1 fixes the issue. Users can workaround the issue by not explicitly checking that the value is False. Checking the return value less explicitly should still work.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24880", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFlask-session-captcha Project\u00bbFlask-session-captchaVersions  before (<) 1.2.1cpe:2.3:a:flask-session-captcha_project:flask-session-captcha:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-03  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-16  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 4  2023-10-06  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-02  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-253 Incorrect Check of Function Return Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/253/Incorrect-Check-of-Function-Return-Value.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-394 Unexpected Status Code or Return Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/394/Unexpected-Status-Code-or-Return-Value.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Tethik/flask-session-captcha/security/advisories/GHSA-7r87-cj48-wj45", "ref_desc": "Potential Captcha Validate Bypass due to unexpected return value of validate-function \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Tethik/flask-session-captcha \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Tethik/flask-session-captcha/releases/tag/v1.2.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.2.1 \u00b7 Tethik/flask-session-captcha \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Tethik/flask-session-captcha/commit/2811ae23a38d33b620fb7a07de8837c6d65c13e4", "ref_desc": "add some extra tests to ensure False is returned \u00b7 Tethik/flask-session-captcha@2811ae2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Tethik/flask-session-captcha/pull/27", "ref_desc": "Fix `validate()` returned value by GuillaumeGomez \u00b7 Pull Request #27 \u00b7 Tethik/flask-session-captcha \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
