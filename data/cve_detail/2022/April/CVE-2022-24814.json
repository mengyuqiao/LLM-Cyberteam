{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24814", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24814", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRangerstudio\u00bbDirectusVersions  before (<) 9.7.0cpe:2.3:a:rangerstudio:directus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-26  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-07  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-11  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/tag/v9.7.0", "ref_desc": "Release v9.7.0 \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/esfW7FYwi5aaoGxzU2UdWCH2s8E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/12020", "ref_desc": "Allow configuring /assets endpoint CSP separately by rijkvanzanten \u00b7 Pull Request #12020 \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-xmjj-3c76-5w84", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in directus \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
