{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20788", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified CM Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20788", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 11.5\\(1\\)andbefore (<) 11.5\\(1\\)su11cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bb     Session ManagementEditionVersions  from including (>=) 11.5\\(1\\)andbefore (<) 11.5\\(1\\)su11cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:session_management:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14su1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bb     Session ManagementEditionVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14su1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:session_management:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 12.5\\(1\\)andbefore (<) 12.5\\(1\\)su6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bb     Session ManagementEditionVersions  from including (>=) 12.5\\(1\\)andbefore (<) 12.5\\(1\\)su6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:session_management:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnity ConnectionVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14su1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unity_connection:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnity ConnectionVersions  from including (>=) 12.5\\(1\\)andbefore (<) 12.5\\(1\\)su6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unity_connection:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-12  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-02  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-28  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-03-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-xss-6MCe4kPF", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Communications Products Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
