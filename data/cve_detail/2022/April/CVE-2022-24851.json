{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24851", "Description": "LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is an open source web frontend for managing entries stored in an LDAP directory. The profile editor tool has an edit profile functionality, the parameters on this page are not properly sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks. An authenticated user can store XSS payloads in the profiles, which gets triggered when any other user try to access the edit profile page. The pdf editor tool has an edit pdf profile functionality, the logoFile parameter in it is not properly sanitized and an user can enter relative paths like ../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png via tools like burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the edited profile the pdf icon has the image on that path(if image is present). Both issues require an attacker to be able to login to LAM admin interface. The issue is fixed in version 7.9.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24851", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLdap-account-manager\u00bbLdap Account ManagerVersions  before (<) 7.9.1cpe:2.3:a:ldap-account-manager:ldap_account_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.14%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-07  0.08%  0.16%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-11-06  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 \n 7  2023-02-23  3.87%  0.95%  -2.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/issues/170", "ref_desc": "Multiple vulnerabilities in LDAP Account Manager \u00b7 Issue #170 \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-f2fr-cccr-583v", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS and arbitrary image read vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5177", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5177-1 ldap-account-managerThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q8aigTGowKHLjKYpFXXPBDg6CCE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/3c6f09a3579e048e224eb5a4c4e3eefaa8bccd49", "ref_desc": "#170 fixed security issues in profile editor and PDF editor \u00b7 LDAPAccountManager/lam@3c6f09a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
