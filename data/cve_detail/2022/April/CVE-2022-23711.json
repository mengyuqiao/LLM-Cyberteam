Elastic Stack monitoring features provide a way to keep a pulse on the health and performance of your Elasticsearch cluster. Authentication with a vulnerable Kibana instance is not required to view the exposed information. The Elastic Stack monitoring exposure only impacts users that have set any of the optional monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.* settings in order to configure Kibana as a remote UI for Elastic Stack Monitoring. The same vulnerability in Kibana could expose other non-sensitive application-internal information in the page source.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23711", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbKibanaVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.1.3cpe:2.3:a:elastic:kibana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nElastic\u00bbKibanaVersions  from including (>=) 7.2.1andbefore (<) 7.17.3cpe:2.3:a:elastic:kibana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-12  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-02  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-04-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/kibana-7-17-3-and-8-1-3-security-update/302826", "ref_desc": "Kibana 7.17.3 and 8.1.3 Security Update - Announcements / Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
