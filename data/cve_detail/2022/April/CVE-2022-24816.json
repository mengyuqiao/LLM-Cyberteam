{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24816", "Description": "JAI-EXT is an open-source project which aims to extend the Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) API. Programs allowing Jiffle script to be provided via network request can lead to a Remote Code Execution as the Jiffle script is compiled into Java code via Janino, and executed. In particular, this affects the downstream GeoServer project. Version 1.2.22 will contain a patch that disables the ability to inject malicious code into the resulting script. Users unable to upgrade may negate the ability to compile Jiffle scripts from the final application, by removing janino-x.y.z.jar from the classpath.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24816", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGeosolutionsgroup\u00bbJai-extVersions  before (<) 1.1.22cpe:2.3:a:geosolutionsgroup:jai-ext:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.00% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  96.30%  96.00%  -0.30 \n 2  2024-11-17  96.46%  96.30%  -0.17 \n 3  2024-10-22  96.50%  96.46%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-10-09  96.69%  96.50%  -0.20 \n 5  2024-09-25  96.67%  96.69%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-07-05  96.78%  96.67%  -0.11 \n 7  2024-06-27  82.17%  96.78%  +14.61 \n 8  2024-03-28  86.27%  82.17%  -4.10 \n 9  2024-02-28  86.51%  86.27%  -0.24 \n 10  2023-11-19  87.97%  86.51%  -1.46 \n 11  2023-11-05  87.56%  87.97%  +0.41 \n 12  2023-09-24  87.80%  87.56%  -0.24 \n 13  2023-07-19  85.86%  87.80%  +1.94 \n 14  2023-07-08  87.78%  85.86%  -1.92 \n 15  2023-05-16  88.76%  87.78%  -0.98 \n 16  2023-05-08  88.51%  88.76%  +0.25 \n 17  2023-04-20  86.94%  88.51%  +1.57 \n 18  2023-04-09  88.08%  86.94%  -1.15 \n 19  2023-03-26  88.92%  88.08%  -0.84 \n 20  2023-03-14  86.75%  88.92%  +2.17 \n 21  2023-03-07  1.98%  86.75%  +84.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/geosolutions-it/jai-ext/commit/cb1d6565d38954676b0a366da4f965fef38da1cb", "ref_desc": "Validate Jiffle input variable names according to grammar, escape jav\u2026 \u00b7 geosolutions-it/jai-ext@cb1d656 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/geosolutions-it/jai-ext/security/advisories/GHSA-v92f-jx6p-73rx", "ref_desc": "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') in jai-ext \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 geosolutions-it/jai-ext \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
