{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24892", "Description": "Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform. Starting with version 5.0.4 and before version 5.7.9, multiple tokens for password reset can be requested. All tokens can be used to change the password. This makes it possible for an attacker to take over the victim's account if they somehow gain access to the victims email account and find an unused password reset token in the emails. This issue is fixed in version 5.7.9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24892", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.4andbefore (<) 5.7.9cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.27%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-18  0.23%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-12-04  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-19  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-09  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-05  0.10%  0.19%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-03-29  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.shopware.com/en/changelog-sw5/#5-7-9", "ref_desc": "Shopware ChangelogRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8WKm4Yyf5ImAYTp7K9Df-FZL3TE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-3qrq-r688-vvh4", "ref_desc": "Multiple valid tokens for password reset \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/shopware \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-5-en/security-updates/security-update-04-2022", "ref_desc": "Shopware 5 - Security Updates - Security Update 04/2022Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uGtut1sdGIZpVSGNwLhhye1dOkU.html"}]}
