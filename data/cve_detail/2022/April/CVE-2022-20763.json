{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20763", "Description": "A vulnerability in the login authorization components of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary Java code. This vulnerability is due to improper deserialization of Java code within login requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious login requests to the Cisco Webex Meetings service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary Java code and take arbitrary actions within the Cisco Webex Meetings application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20763", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings Online\u00bbVersion:Wbs42.2.1-1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings_online:wbs42.2.1-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-18  0.71%  0.60%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-08-22  0.57%  0.71%  +0.15 \n 3  2024-08-07  0.21%  0.57%  +0.36 \n 4  2024-06-28  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-02  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-21  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-02-07  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-11-12  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-10-28  0.12%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-04-13  0.08%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-java-MVX6crH9", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Meetings Java Deserialization VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
