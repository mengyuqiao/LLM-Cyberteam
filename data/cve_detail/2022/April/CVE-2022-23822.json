{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23822", "Description": "In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23822", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXilinx\u00bbZynq-7000s FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2022.1cpe:2.3:o:xilinx:zynq-7000s_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Xilinx\u00bbZynq-7000s\u00bbVersion:N/A\nXilinx\u00bbZynq-7000 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2022.1cpe:2.3:o:xilinx:zynq-7000_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Xilinx\u00bbZynq-7000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-18  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Xilinx/embeddedsw/tree/master/lib/sw_apps/zynq_fsbl", "ref_desc": "embeddedsw/lib/sw_apps/zynq_fsbl at master \u00b7 Xilinx/embeddedsw \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.xilinx.com/s/article/76974", "ref_desc": "WidgetVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
