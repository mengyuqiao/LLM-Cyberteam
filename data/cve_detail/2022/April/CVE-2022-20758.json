{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20758", "Description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must control a BGP speaker that has an established trusted peer connection to an affected device that is configured with the address family L2VPN EVPN to receive and process the update message. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by any data that is initiated by clients on the Layer 2 network or by peers that are not configured to accept the L2VPN EVPN address family. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP updates only from explicitly defined peers. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the malicious BGP update message must either come from a configured, valid BGP peer or be injected by the attacker into the affected BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20758", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  before (<) 6.8.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 7.4andbefore (<) 7.4.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 7.0andbefore (<) 7.3.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-06  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-26  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-22  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-16  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bgpevpn-zWTRtPBb", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software Border Gateway Protocol Ethernet VPN Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
