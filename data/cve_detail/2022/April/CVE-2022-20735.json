A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. These actions could include modifying the system configuration and deleting accounts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20735", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan VmanageVersions  before (<) 20.6.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan_vmanage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCatalyst Sd-wan Manager\u00bbVersion:20.7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:catalyst_sd-wan_manager:20.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-06  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2023-09-26  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-04-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-16  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-vmanage-csrf-rxQL4tXR", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
