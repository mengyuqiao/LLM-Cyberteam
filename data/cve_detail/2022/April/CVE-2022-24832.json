{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24832", "Description": "GoCD is an open source a continuous delivery server. The bundled gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the username to construct LDAP queries. While this does not directly allow arbitrary LDAP data exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated GoCD user with malicious intent to construct and execute malicious queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users or entries within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed passwords etc) through brute force mechanisms. This only affects users who have a working LDAP authorization configuration enabled on their GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating using such an LDAP configuration. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 22.1.0, which is bundled with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin v2.2.0-144.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24832", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  from including (>=) 17.5.0andbefore (<) 22.1.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-07-17  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-04-18  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-12  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.09%  -1.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/releases/tag/v2.2.0-144", "ref_desc": "Release 2.2.0-144 \u00b7 gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/10244", "ref_desc": "Bump bundled gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin to v2.2.0-144 by chadlwilson \u00b7 Pull Request #10244 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#22-1-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CK-PfRmwBo8nAl6cT8OwKhSxscw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/22.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release GoCD 22.1.0 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kg2VRgJaoWsT8tlmFzg8TXhy0Zc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin", "ref_desc": "GitHub - gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin: LDAP authentication plugin for GoCDProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/commit/87fa7dac5d899b3960ab48e151881da4793cfcc3", "ref_desc": "Escape/encode values when building search filters. \u00b7 gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin@87fa7da \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.gocd.org/22.1.0/configuration/dev_authentication.html#ldapad-authentication", "ref_desc": "Authentication | GoCD User DocumentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-x5v3-x9qj-mh3h", "ref_desc": "Bundled ldap-authentication-plugin fails to neutralise LDAP special elements in usernames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
