{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24900", "Description": "Piano LED Visualizer is software that allows LED lights to light up as a person plays a piano connected to a computer. Version 1.3 and prior are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. Since the \"malicious\" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24900", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nPiano Led Visualizer Project\u00bbPiano Led VisualizerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.15%  1.40%  +0.25 \n 2  2024-12-03  0.93%  1.15%  +0.22 \n 3  2024-07-21  0.93%  0.93%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-06-22  1.00%  0.93%  -0.07 \n 5  2023-12-19  1.21%  1.00%  -0.21 \n 6  2023-11-20  1.66%  1.21%  -0.45 \n 7  2023-10-10  1.41%  1.66%  +0.25 \n 8  2023-09-27  1.09%  1.41%  +0.32 \n 9  2023-08-04  0.91%  1.09%  +0.18 \n 10  2023-06-26  0.97%  0.91%  -0.07 \n 11  2023-06-01  0.82%  0.97%  +0.15 \n 12  2023-05-06  0.41%  0.82%  +0.41 \n 13  2023-03-30  0.39%  0.41%  +0.02 \n 14  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.39%  -0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/73/External-Control-of-File-Name-or-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/issues/350", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerability Found \u00b7 Issue #350 \u00b7 onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/blob/6a732caa812c83a807c711f3d091af99209cae7b/webinterface/views_api.py#L970", "ref_desc": "Piano-LED-Visualizer/views_api.py at 6a732caa812c83a807c711f3d091af99209cae7b \u00b7 onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/pull/351", "ref_desc": "Fix Path Traversal Vulnerability by porcupineyhairs \u00b7 Pull Request #351 \u00b7 onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/security/advisories/GHSA-g78x-q3x8-r6m4", "ref_desc": "Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of `send_file` call \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/commit/3f10602323cd8184e1c69a76b815655597bf0ee5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #351 from porcupineyhairs/FixPathInjection \u00b7 onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer@3f10602 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
