{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20675", "Description": "A vulnerability in the TCP/IP stack of Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, formerly Security Management Appliance, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to crash the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) service, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to an open port listener on TCP port 199. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to TCP port 199. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the SNMP service, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20675", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.02.0-020cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 12.5andbefore (<) 14.1.0-239cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbSecure Email And Web Manager\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 12.0andbefore (<) 14.0.2-012cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-28  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-17  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-13  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ESA-SNMP-JLAJksWK", "ref_desc": "Multiple Cisco Security Products Simple Network Management Protocol Service Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
