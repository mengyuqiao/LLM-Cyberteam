{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20714", "Description": "A vulnerability in the data plane microcode of Lightspeed-Plus line cards for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the line card to reset. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed packets that are received on the Lightspeed-Plus line cards. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Lightspeed-Plus line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition for any traffic that traverses that line card.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20714", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xr\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9902\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9903\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-06  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-26  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-04-22  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-16  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-126 Buffer Over-read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/126/Buffer-Over-read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-lsplus-Z6AQEOjk", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software for ASR 9000 Series Routers Lightspeed-Plus Line Cards Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
