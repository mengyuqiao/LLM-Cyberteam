{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24821", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Simple users can create global SSX/JSX without specific rights: in theory only users with Programming Rights should be allowed to create SSX or JSX that are executed everywhere on a wiki. But a bug allow anyone with edit rights to actually create those. This issue has been patched in XWiki 13.10-rc-1, 12.10.11 and 13.4.6. There's no easy workaround for this issue, administrators should upgrade their wiki.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24821", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 13.4.0andbefore (<) 13.4.6cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andbefore (<) 12.10.11cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:13.10cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:13.10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-10-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-04-15  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-09  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-648 Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/648/Incorrect-Use-of-Privileged-APIs.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19155", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19155] Simple users can create global SSX/JSX without specific rights - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-ghcq-472w-vf4h", "ref_desc": "Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs in org.xwiki.platform.skin.skinx \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
