{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20732", "Description": "A vulnerability in the configuration file protections of Cisco Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access confidential information and elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper access permissions for certain configuration files. An attacker with low-privileged credentials could exploit this vulnerability by accessing an affected device and reading the affected configuration files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain internal database credentials, which the attacker could use to view and modify the contents of the database. The attacker could use this access to the database to elevate privileges on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20732", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbVirtualized Infrastructure ManagerVersions  before (<) 4.2.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:virtualized_infrastructure_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vim-privesc-T2tsFUf", "ref_desc": "Cisco Virtualized Infrastructure Manager Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
