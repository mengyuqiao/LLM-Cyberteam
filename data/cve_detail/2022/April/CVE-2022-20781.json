{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20781", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20781", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  before (<) 14.5cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-04-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.05%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wsa-stored-xss-XPsJghMY", "ref_desc": "Cisco Web Security Appliance Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
