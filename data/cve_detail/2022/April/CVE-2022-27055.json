{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-27055", "Description": "ecjia-daojia 1.38.1-20210202629 is vulnerable to information leakage via content/apps/installer/classes/Helper.php. When the web program is installed, a new environment file is created, and the database information is recorded, including the database record password. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the environment file is in the data directory, which is not intended for access by website visitors (only the statics directory can be accessed by website visitors)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27055", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEcjia\u00bbDaojia\u00bbVersion:1.38.1-20210202629cpe:2.3:a:ecjia:daojia:1.38.1-20210202629:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.34%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-11-23  0.21%  0.26%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-07-11  0.16%  0.21%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-11-10  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-01  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-22  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-04-26  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-03-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ecjia/ecjia-daojia/blob/dfb322387e8d3d50719e44d23d793072616ff789/content/apps/installer/classes/Helper.php#L312-L318", "ref_desc": "ecjia-daojia/Helper.php at dfb322387e8d3d50719e44d23d793072616ff789 \u00b7 ecjia/ecjia-daojia \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ecjia/ecjia-daojia/blob/dfb322387e8d3d50719e44d23d793072616ff789/content/apps/installer/classes/Controllers/IndexController.php#L74-L78", "ref_desc": "ecjia-daojia/IndexController.php at dfb322387e8d3d50719e44d23d793072616ff789 \u00b7 ecjia/ecjia-daojia \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ecjia/ecjia-daojia/issues/20", "ref_desc": "information leakage \u00b7 Issue #20 \u00b7 ecjia/ecjia-daojia \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
