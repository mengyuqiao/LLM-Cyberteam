{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24881", "Description": "Ballcat Codegen provides the function of online editing code to generate templates. In versions prior to 1.0.0.beta.2, attackers can implement remote code execution through malicious code injection of the template engine. This happens because Velocity and freemarker templates are introduced but input verification is not done. The fault is rectified in version 1.0.0.beta.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24881", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nBallcat\u00bbCodegenVersions  before (<) 1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:ballcat:codegen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.59% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.34%  1.59%  -0.75 \n 2  2024-11-30  1.90%  2.34%  +0.44 \n 3  2024-11-04  1.35%  1.90%  +0.55 \n 4  2024-10-08  1.30%  1.35%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-07-18  1.01%  1.30%  +0.29 \n 6  2023-12-16  0.71%  1.01%  +0.30 \n 7  2023-12-02  0.58%  0.71%  +0.13 \n 8  2023-11-17  0.51%  0.58%  +0.07 \n 9  2023-10-07  0.45%  0.51%  +0.06 \n 10  2023-08-01  0.46%  0.45%  0.00 \n 11  2023-05-29  0.37%  0.46%  +0.09 \n 12  2023-05-03  0.26%  0.37%  +0.11 \n 13  2023-03-07  5.63%  0.26%  -5.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ballcat-projects/ballcat-codegen/issues/5", "ref_desc": "ballcat-codegen template engine injection RCE \u00b7 Issue #5 \u00b7 ballcat-projects/ballcat-codegen \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ballcat-projects/ballcat-codegen/commit/84a7cb38daf0295b93aba21d562ec627e4eb463b", "ref_desc": ":lock: \u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u677f\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62RCE \u00b7 ballcat-projects/ballcat-codegen@84a7cb3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ballcat-projects/ballcat-codegen/security/advisories/GHSA-fv3m-xhqw-9m79", "ref_desc": "ballcat-codegen exists for template engine remote code execution injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ballcat-projects/ballcat-codegen \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
