{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24248", "Description": "RiteCMS version 3.1.0 and below suffers from an arbitrary file deletion via path traversal vulnerability in Admin Panel. Exploiting the vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to delete any file in the web root (along with any other file on the server that the PHP process user has the proper permissions to delete). Furthermore, an attacker might leverage the capability of arbitrary file deletion to circumvent certain web server security mechanisms such as deleting .htaccess file that would deactivate those security constraints.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24248", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nRitecms\u00bbRitecmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:ritecms:ritecms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-18  0.32%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-03  0.23%  0.32%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-09-10  0.23%  0.23%  0.00 \n 4  2023-04-19  0.31%  0.23%  -0.08 \n 5  2023-03-25  0.21%  0.31%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-03-13  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  7.31%  0.17%  -7.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50615", "ref_desc": "RiteCMS 3.1.0 - Arbitrary File Deletion (Authenticated) - PHP webapps ExploitExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://en.0day.today/exploit/description/37177", "ref_desc": "0day.today Agreement - 0day.today Exploit Database : vulnerability : 0day : new exploits : buy and sell private exploit : shellcode by 0day Today TeamExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
