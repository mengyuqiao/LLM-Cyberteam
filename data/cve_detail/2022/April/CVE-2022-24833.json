{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24833", "Description": "PrivateBin is minimalist, open source online pastebin clone where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data. In PrivateBin < v1.4.0 a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found. The vulnerability is present in all versions from v0.21 of the project, which was at the time still called ZeroBin. The issue is caused by the fact that SVGs can contain JavaScript. This can allow an attacker to execute code, if the user opens a paste with a specifically crafted SVG attachment, and interacts with the preview image and the instance isn't protected by an appropriate content security policy. Users are advised to either upgrade to version 1.4.0 or to ensure the content security policy of their instance is set correctly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24833", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nPrivatebin\u00bbPrivatebinVersions  from including (>=) 0.21andbefore (<) 1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:privatebin:privatebin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2024-11-15  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-02  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-09-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-18  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.05%  -1.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/commit/2a4d572c1e9eb9b608d32b0cc0cb3b6c3b684eab", "ref_desc": "Sanitize SVG preview, preventing script execution in instance context\u2026 \u00b7 PrivateBin/PrivateBin@2a4d572 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/security/advisories/GHSA-cqcc-mm6x-vmvw", "ref_desc": "Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SVG attachments in PrivateBin < v1.4.0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrivateBin/PrivateBin \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
