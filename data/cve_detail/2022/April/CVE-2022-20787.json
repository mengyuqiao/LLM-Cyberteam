{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20787", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) Software and Cisco Unified CM Session Management Edition (SME) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20787", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14su1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bb     Session ManagementEditionVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14su1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:session_management:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 12.5\\(1\\)andbefore (<) 12.5\\(1\\)su6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bb     Session ManagementEditionVersions  from including (>=) 12.5\\(1\\)andbefore (<) 12.5\\(1\\)su6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:session_management:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-04  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-27  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 4  2023-11-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-22  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucm-csrf-jrKP4eNT", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Communications Products Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
