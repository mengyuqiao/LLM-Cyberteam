{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36799", "Description": "This issue exists to document that a security improvement in the way that Jira Server and Data Center use templates has been implemented. Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allowed remote attackers with system administrator permissions to execute arbitrary code via Template Injection leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the Email Templates feature. In this case the security improvement was to protect against using the XStream library to be able to execute arbitrary code in velocity templates. The affected versions are before version 8.13.19, from version 8.14.0 before 8.20.7, and from version 8.21.0 before 8.22.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36799", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAtlassian\u00bbJira ServerVersions  from including (>=) 8.21.0andbefore (<) 8.22.1cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJira ServerVersions  before (<) 8.13.19cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJira ServerVersions  from including (>=) 8.14.0andbefore (<) 8.20.7cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJira Data CenterVersions  from including (>=) 8.21.0andbefore (<) 8.22.1cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira_data_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJira Data CenterVersions  from including (>=) 8.14.0andbefore (<) 8.20.7cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira_data_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbJira Data CenterVersions  before (<) 8.13.19cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:jira_data_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-02-19  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-08-07  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-07-01  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.08%  -1.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-73582", "ref_desc": "[JRASERVER-73582] Template Injection in Email Templates - bypass of mitigation via XStream - CVE-2022-36799 - Create and track feature requests for Atlassian products.Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
