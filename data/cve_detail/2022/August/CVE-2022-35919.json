{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35919", "Description": "MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. In affected versions all 'admin' users authorized for `admin:ServerUpdate` can selectively trigger an error that in response, returns the content of the path requested. Any normal OS system would allow access to contents at any arbitrary paths that are readable by MinIO process. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable ServerUpdate API by denying the `admin:ServerUpdate` action for your admin users via IAM policies.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35919", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinioVersions  before (<) 2022-07-29t19-40-48zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.67% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.47%  0.67%  +0.21 \n 2  2024-10-23  0.36%  0.47%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-08-27  0.27%  0.36%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-05-20  0.25%  0.27%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-22  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-02-09  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-10-11  0.19%  0.17%  -0.02 \n 8  2023-10-10  0.14%  0.19%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-08-08  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-07-02  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/bc72e4226e669d98c8e0f3eccc9297be9251c692", "ref_desc": "do not allow filesystem fallback in server download (#15429) \u00b7 minio/minio@bc72e42 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/15429", "ref_desc": "do not allow filesystem fallback in server download by harshavardhana \u00b7 Pull Request #15429 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-gr9v-6pcm-rqvg", "ref_desc": "Authenticated requests for server update admin API allows path traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175010/Minio-2022-07-29T19-40-48Z-Path-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Minio 2022-07-29T19-40-48Z Path Traversal \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
