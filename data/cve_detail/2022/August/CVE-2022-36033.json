{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36033", "Description": "jsoup is a Java HTML parser, built for HTML editing, cleaning, scraping, and cross-site scripting (XSS) safety. jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTML including `javascript:` URL expressions, which could allow XSS attacks when a reader subsequently clicks that link. If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible. This issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3. Users should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version. To remediate this issue without immediately upgrading: - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined. (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36033", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nNetapp\u00bbOncommand Workflow Automation\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:oncommand_workflow_automation:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbManagement Services For Element Software\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:management_services_for_element_software:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbManagement Services For Netapp Hci\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:management_services_for_netapp_hci:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJsoup\u00bbJsoupVersions  before (<) 1.15.3cpe:2.3:a:jsoup:jsoup:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-21  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-01  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-05  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-30  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 \n 8  2023-02-23  4.13%  1.02%  -3.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-87 Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/87/Improper-Neutralization-of-Alternate-XSS-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0006/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-36033 jsoup Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.3", "ref_desc": "jsoup release 1.15.3 (2022-Aug-24)Release Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.15.3", "ref_desc": "Release jsoup 1.15.3 \u00b7 jhy/jsoup \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369", "ref_desc": "The jsoup cleaner may incorrectly sanitize crafted XSS attempts if SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks is enabled \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jhy/jsoup \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
