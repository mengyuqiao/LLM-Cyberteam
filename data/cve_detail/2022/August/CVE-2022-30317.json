{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30317", "Description": "Honeywell Experion LX through 2022-05-06 has Missing Authentication for a Critical Function. According to FSCT-2022-0055, there is a Honeywell Experion LX Control Data Access (CDA) EpicMo protocol with unauthenticated functionality issue. The affected components are characterized as: Honeywell Control Data Access (CDA) EpicMo (55565/TCP). The potential impact is: Firmware manipulation, Denial of service. The Honeywell Experion LX Distributed Control System (DCS) utilizes the Control Data Access (CDA) EpicMo protocol (55565/TCP) for device diagnostics and maintenance purposes. This protocol does not have any authentication features, allowing any attacker capable of communicating with the ports in question to invoke (a subset of) desired functionality. There is no authentication functionality on the protocol in question. An attacker capable of invoking the protocols' functionalities could issue firmware download commands potentially allowing for firmware manipulation and reboot devices causing denial of service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30317", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nHoneywell\u00bbExperion Lx FirmwareVersions  before (<) r520.1cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:experion_lx_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Honeywell\u00bbExperion Lx\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-23  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-11  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-242-07", "ref_desc": "Honeywell Experion LX | CISAMitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
