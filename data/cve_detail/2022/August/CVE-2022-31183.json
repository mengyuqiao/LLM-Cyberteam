{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31183", "Description": "fs2 is a compositional, streaming I/O library for Scala. When establishing a server-mode `TLSSocket` using `fs2-io` on Node.js, the parameter `requestCert = true` is ignored, peer certificate verification is skipped, and the connection proceeds. The vulnerability is limited to: 1. `fs2-io` running on Node.js. The JVM TLS implementation is completely independent. 2. `TLSSocket`s in server-mode. Client-mode `TLSSocket`s are implemented via a different API. 3. mTLS as enabled via `requestCert = true` in `TLSParameters`. The default setting is `false` for server-mode `TLSSocket`s. It was introduced with the initial Node.js implementation of fs2-io in 3.1.0. A patch is released in v3.2.11. The requestCert = true parameter is respected and the peer certificate is verified. If verification fails, a SSLException is raised. If using an unpatched version on Node.js, do not use a server-mode TLSSocket with requestCert = true to establish a mTLS connection.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31183", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTypelevel\u00bbFS2Versions  from including (>=) 3.1.0andbefore (<) 3.2.11cpe:2.3:a:typelevel:fs2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.35%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-10-23  0.21%  0.27%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-03-22  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-03-08  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-22  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-01-12  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-09-03  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-08-08  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-07-02  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43994", "ref_desc": "How to use `new tls.TLSSocket(...)` to establish a secure connection? \u00b7 Issue #43994 \u00b7 nodejs/node \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/commit/659824395826a314e0a4331535dbf1ef8bef8207", "ref_desc": "First attempt at test for GHSA-2cpx-6pqp-wf35 \u00b7 typelevel/fs2@6598243 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/security/advisories/GHSA-2cpx-6pqp-wf35", "ref_desc": "mTLS client verification is skipped in Node.js TLS server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 typelevel/fs2 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
