{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36048", "Description": "Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with topic-based threading that combines email and chat. When displaying messages with embedded remote images, Zulip normally loads the image preview via a go-camo proxy server. However, an attacker who can send messages could include a crafted URL that tricks the server into embedding a remote image reference directly. This could allow the attacker to infer the viewer\u2019s IP address and browser fingerprinting information. This vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.6. Zulip organizations with image and link previews [disabled](https://zulip.com/help/allow-image-link-previews) are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36048", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulipVersions  before (<) 5.6cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-03-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-vg5m-mf9x-j452", "ref_desc": "IP address leak via image proxy bypass in Zulip Server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
