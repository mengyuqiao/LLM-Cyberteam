{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36006", "Description": "Arvados is an open source platform for managing, processing, and sharing genomic and other large scientific and biomedical data. A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Arvados Workbench allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. This exists in all versions up to 2.4.1 and is fixed in 2.4.2. This vulnerability is specific to the Ruby on Rails Workbench application (\u201cWorkbench 1\u201d). We do not believe any other Arvados components, including the TypesScript browser-based Workbench application (\u201cWorkbench 2\u201d) or API Server, are vulnerable to this attack. For versions of Arvados earlier than 2.4.2: remove the Ruby-based \"Workbench 1\" app (\"apt-get remove arvados-workbench\") from your installation as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36006", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nArvados\u00bbArvados\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 2.4.2cpe:2.3:a:arvados:arvados:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.47%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-06-30  0.47%  0.39%  -0.08 \n 3  2024-06-02  0.45%  0.47%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-04  0.38%  0.45%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-03-21  0.36%  0.38%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-03-06  0.31%  0.36%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-08-20  0.15%  0.31%  +0.16 \n 8  2023-07-14  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.13%  -4.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/arvados/arvados/security/advisories/GHSA-8867-q4xf-cqgm", "ref_desc": "Authenticated remote code execution due to insecure deserialization (GHSL-2022-063) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 arvados/arvados \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://arvados.org/release-notes/2.4.2/", "ref_desc": "Arvados 2.4.2 Release Notes | ArvadosVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19316", "ref_desc": "Bug #19316: Audit usage of Oj gem & make sure to use safe_load or replace with different gem - ArvadosIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
