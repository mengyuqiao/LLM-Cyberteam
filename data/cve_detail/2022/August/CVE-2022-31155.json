{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31155", "Description": "Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31155", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSourcegraph\u00bbSourcegraphVersions  before (<) 3.41.0cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:sourcegraph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-02  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/commit/2832d7882396a6295ba5803b5ef48dc7d5a24c59", "ref_desc": "Saved searches: fix update permissions (#36674) \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph@2832d78 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-37qp-9jq6-f6mx", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized overwriting of saved searches in Sourcegraph \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
