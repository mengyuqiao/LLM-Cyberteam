{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-37022", "Description": "Apache Geode versions up to 1.12.2 and 1.13.2 are vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 11. Any user wishing to protect against deserialization attacks involving JMX or RMI should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15. Use of 1.15 on Java 11 will automatically protect JMX over RMI against deserialization attacks. This should have no impact on performance since it only affects JMX/RMI which Gfsh uses to communicate with the JMX Manager which is hosted on a Locator.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37022", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbGeodeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.12.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:geode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbGeodeVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.13.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:geode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-30  0.19%  0.27%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-03-23  0.18%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-11  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 4  2024-01-29  0.18%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-07  0.12%  0.18%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-04-19  0.17%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 8  2023-03-08  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/kr1y4l9752g1ww1shnmh8dbfjq785k4m", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-37022: Apache Geode deserialization of untrusted data flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 11-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
