{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35954", "Description": "The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating actions easier. The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling `core.exportVariable`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35954", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbToolkit\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.9.1cpe:2.3:a:github:toolkit:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-05  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/actions/toolkit/commit/4beda9cbc00ba6eefe387a937c21087ccb8ee9df", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7r3h-m5j6-3q42 \u00b7 actions/toolkit@4beda9c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/actions/toolkit/security/advisories/GHSA-7r3h-m5j6-3q42", "ref_desc": "Delimiter injection vulnerability in @actions/core exportVariable \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 actions/toolkit \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
