{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35943", "Description": "Shield is an authentication and authorization framework for CodeIgniter 4. This vulnerability may allow [SameSite Attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the [CodeIgniter4 CSRF protection](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/security.html) mechanism with CodeIgniter Shield. For this attack to succeed, the attacker must have direct (or indirect, e.g., XSS) control over a subdomain site (e.g., `https://a.example.com/`) of the target site (e.g., `http://example.com/`). Upgrade to **CodeIgniter v4.2.3 or later** and **Shield v1.0.0-beta.2 or later**. As a workaround: set `Config\\Security::$csrfProtection` to `'session,'`remove old session data right after login (immediately after ID and password match) and regenerate CSRF token right after login (immediately after ID and password match)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35943", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCodeigniter\u00bbCodeigniterVersions  before (<) 4.2.3cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter:codeigniter:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCodeigniter\u00bbShield\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateBetacpe:2.3:a:codeigniter:shield:1.0.0:beta:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-11-03  0.18%  0.24%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-04-02  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-03-19  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-03-04  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-01-23  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-08-19  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-07-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jub0bs.com/posts/2021-01-29-great-samesite-confusion", "ref_desc": "The great SameSite confusion :: jub0bs.comThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/security/advisories/GHSA-5hm8-vh6r-2cjq", "ref_desc": "SameSite Attackers may Bypass the CSRF Protection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codeigniter4/shield \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite", "ref_desc": "SameSite cookies - HTTP | MDNThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/security.htm", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub PagesBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
