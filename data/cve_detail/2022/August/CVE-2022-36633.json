{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36633", "Description": "Teleport 9.3.6 is vulnerable to Command injection leading to Remote Code Execution. An attacker can craft a malicious ssh agent installation link by URL encoding a bash escape with carriage return line feed. This url encoded payload can be used in place of a token and sent to a user in a social engineering attack. This is fully unauthenticated attack utilizing the trusted teleport server to deliver the payload.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36633", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGoteleport\u00bbTeleportVersions  before (<) 10.1.2cpe:2.3:a:goteleport:teleport:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "28.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.09%  28.15%  +25.07 \n 2  2024-08-20  2.76%  3.09%  +0.33 \n 3  2024-05-28  2.42%  2.76%  +0.34 \n 4  2024-04-28  3.03%  2.42%  -0.61 \n 5  2024-04-14  3.56%  3.03%  -0.53 \n 6  2024-03-31  2.93%  3.56%  +0.63 \n 7  2024-03-16  2.89%  2.93%  +0.04 \n 8  2024-03-03  2.19%  2.89%  +0.70 \n 9  2024-02-04  2.50%  2.19%  -0.30 \n 10  2023-11-16  2.10%  2.50%  +0.40 \n 11  2023-09-26  1.51%  2.10%  +0.59 \n 12  2023-08-31  0.95%  1.51%  +0.57 \n 13  2023-08-20  0.82%  0.95%  +0.13 \n 14  2023-07-25  0.80%  0.82%  +0.02 \n 15  2023-03-07  11.07%  0.80%  -10.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168137/Teleport-9.3.6-Command-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Teleport 9.3.6 Command Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitational/teleport", "ref_desc": "GitHub - gravitational/teleport: The easiest, most secure way to access infrastructure.Product;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168477/Teleport-10.1.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Teleport 10.1.1 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
