{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36007", "Description": "Venice is a Clojure inspired sandboxed Lisp dialect with excellent Java interoperability. A partial path traversal issue exists within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list of load paths. Assuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ \"/Users/foo/resources\" ]` When passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine: `(load-resource \"test.png\")` => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\" `(load-resource \"../resources-alt/test.png\")` => rejected, outside the load path When passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths: `(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\")` => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\" `(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\")` => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\" !!! The latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability. This issue\u2019s scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `\"/Users/foo/resources\"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also from `\"/Users/foo/resources-alt\"`, but not from `\"/Users/foo/images\"`. Versions of Venice before and including v1.10.17 are affected by this issue. Upgrade to Venice >= 1.10.18, if you are on a version < 1.10.18. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36007", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nVenice Project\u00bbVeniceVersions  before (<) 1.10.17cpe:2.3:a:venice_project:venice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jlangch/venice/commit/c942c73136333bc493050910f171a48e6f575b23", "ref_desc": "vuln-fix: Partial Path Traversal Vulnerability \u00b7 jlangch/venice@c942c73 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jlangch/venice/releases/tag/v1.10.17", "ref_desc": "Release Release 1.10.17 \u00b7 jlangch/venice \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jlangch/venice/security/advisories/GHSA-4mmh-5vw7-rgvj", "ref_desc": "Partial Path Traversal in com.github.jlangch:venice \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jlangch/venice \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jlangch/venice/commit/215ae91bb964013b0a2d70718a692832d561ae0a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #4 from BulkSecurityGeneratorProjectV2/fix/JLL/par\u2026 \u00b7 jlangch/venice@215ae91 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
