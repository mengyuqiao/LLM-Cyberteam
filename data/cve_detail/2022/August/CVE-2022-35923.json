{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35923", "Description": "v8n is a javascript validation library. Versions of v8n prior to 1.5.1 were found to have an inefficient regular expression complexity in the `lowercase()` and `uppercase()` regex which could lead to a denial of service attack. In testing of the `lowercase()` function a payload of 'a' + 'a'.repeat(i) + 'A' with 32 leading characters took 29443 ms to execute. The same issue happens with uppercase(). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35923", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nV8n Project\u00bbV8N\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.5.1cpe:2.3:a:v8n_project:v8n:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.15%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-10-24  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-03-23  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-09  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-23  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-01-13  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-09-04  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-08-09  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-07-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/2d92f644-593b-43b4-bfd1-c8042ac60609/", "ref_desc": "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity potentially leads to Denial of Service in vulnerability found in v8nExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/imbrn/v8n/security/advisories/GHSA-xrx9-gj26-5wx9", "ref_desc": "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 imbrn/v8n \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/imbrn/v8n/commit/92393862156fad190c05ec3f6e2bc73308dcd2f9", "ref_desc": "fix inefficient regular expressions on lowercase and uppercase rules \u00b7 imbrn/v8n@9239386 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
