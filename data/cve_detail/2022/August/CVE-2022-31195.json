{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31195", "Description": "DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. In affected versions the ItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server. However, this path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server). This vulnerability impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line. Users are advised to upgrade. As a basic workaround, users may block all access to the following URL paths: If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to /admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/xmlui\", then you'd need to block access to /xmlui/admin/batchimport. If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to /dspace-admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/jspui\", then you'd need to block access to /jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport. Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31195", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDuraspace\u00bbDspaceVersions  after (>) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.4cpe:2.3:a:duraspace:dspace:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDuraspace\u00bbDspaceVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.10cpe:2.3:a:duraspace:dspace:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-22  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-08  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-22  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-12  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-08  0.08%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-07-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/56e76049185bbd87c994128a9d77735ad7af0199", "ref_desc": "[DS-4131] Better path handling in ItemImport zips \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@56e7604 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/7af52a0883a9dbc475cf3001f04ed11b24c8a4c0", "ref_desc": "[DS-4131] Fix zip import handling to avoid path traversal exploit \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@7af52a0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-8rmh-55h4-93h5", "ref_desc": "Path traversal vulnerability in Simple Archive Format package import (ItemImportService API) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
