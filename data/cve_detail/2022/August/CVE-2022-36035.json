{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36035", "Description": "Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy. Flux CLI allows users to deploy Flux components into a Kubernetes cluster via command-line. The vulnerability allows other applications to replace the Flux deployment information with arbitrary content which is deployed into the target Kubernetes cluster instead. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of user-supplied input, which results in a path traversal that can be controlled by the attacker. Users sharing the same shell between other applications and the Flux CLI commands could be affected by this vulnerability. In some scenarios no errors may be presented, which may cause end users not to realize that something is amiss. A safe workaround is to execute Flux CLI in ephemeral and isolated shell environments, which can ensure no persistent values exist from previous processes. However, upgrading to the latest version of the CLI is still the recommended mitigation strategy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36035", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nFluxcd\u00bbFlux2Versions  from including (>=) 0.21.0andbefore (<) 0.32.0cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:flux2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.32.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.32.0 \u00b7 fluxcd/flux2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-xwf3-6rgv-939r", "ref_desc": "Flux CLI Workload Injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fluxcd/flux2 \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
