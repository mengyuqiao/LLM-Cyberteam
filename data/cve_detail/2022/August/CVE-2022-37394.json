{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-37394", "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Nova before 23.2.2, 24.x before 24.1.2, and 25.x before 25.0.2. By creating a neutron port with the direct vnic_type, creating an instance bound to that port, and then changing the vnic_type of the bound port to macvtap, an authenticated user may cause the compute service to fail to restart, resulting in a possible denial of service. Only Nova deployments configured with SR-IOV are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37394", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpenstack\u00bbNovaVersions  before (<) 23.2.2cpe:2.3:a:openstack:nova:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbNovaVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.0andbefore (<) 25.0.2cpe:2.3:a:openstack:nova:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbNovaVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.1.2cpe:2.3:a:openstack:nova:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/+bug/1981813", "ref_desc": "Bug #1981813 \u201cCompute service fails to restart if the vnic_type ...\u201d : Bugs : OpenStack Security AdvisoryExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/+/850003", "ref_desc": "Gracefully ERROR in _init_instance if vnic_type changed (850003) \u00b7 Gerrit Code ReviewThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/+/849985", "ref_desc": "Reproduce bug 1981813 in func env (849985) \u00b7 Gerrit Code ReviewPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
