{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31179", "Description": "Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Versions prior to 1.5.8 were found to be subject to code injection on windows. This impacts users that use Shescape (any API function) to escape arguments for cmd.exe on Windows An attacker can omit all arguments following their input by including a line feed character (`'\\n'`) in the payload. This bug has been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Alternatively, line feed characters (`'\\n'`) can be stripped out manually or the user input can be made the last argument (this only limits the impact).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31179", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShescape Project\u00bbShescapeVersions  before (<) 1.5.8cpe:2.3:a:shescape_project:shescape:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-23  0.21%  0.27%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-03-22  0.18%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-03-08  0.14%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-22  0.20%  0.14%  -0.06 \n 6  2024-01-12  0.19%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-09-03  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-08-08  0.10%  0.17%  +0.07 \n 9  2023-07-02  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/332", "ref_desc": "Don't ignore newlines when fuzzing by ericcornelissen \u00b7 Pull Request #332 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-jjc5-fp7p-6f8w", "ref_desc": "Insufficient escaping of line feeds for CMD \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8", "ref_desc": "Release Release v1.5.8 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vPYvHGUQ7GdXYleUvsliZ7YdfEs.html"}]}
