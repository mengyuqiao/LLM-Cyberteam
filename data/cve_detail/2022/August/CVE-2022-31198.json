{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31198", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. This issue concerns instances of Governor that use the module `GovernorVotesQuorumFraction`, a mechanism that determines quorum requirements as a percentage of the voting token's total supply. In affected instances, when a proposal is passed to lower the quorum requirements, past proposals may become executable if they had been defeated only due to lack of quorum, and the number of votes it received meets the new quorum requirement. Analysis of instances on chain found only one proposal that met this condition, and we are actively monitoring for new occurrences of this particular issue. This issue has been patched in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider avoiding lowering quorum requirements if a past proposal was defeated for lack of quorum.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31198", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.3.0andbefore (<) 4.7.2cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts Upgradeable\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.3.0andbefore (<) 4.7.2cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts_upgradeable:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-22  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-02  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/682/Incorrect-Calculation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-xrc4-737v-9q75", "ref_desc": "GovernorVotesQuorumFraction updates to quorum may affect past defeated proposals \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3561", "ref_desc": "Keep track of historical quorum values by Amxx \u00b7 Pull Request #3561 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
