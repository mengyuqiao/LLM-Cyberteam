When that URL is clicked by the target, it redirects them to a site of the attacker's choice. This issue has been patched in versions 5.11 and 6.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31193", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nDuraspace\u00bbDspaceVersions  after (>) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.4cpe:2.3:a:duraspace:dspace:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDuraspace\u00bbDspaceVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.10cpe:2.3:a:duraspace:dspace:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-22  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-08  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-763j-q7wv-vf3m", "ref_desc": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in JSPUI's controlled vocabulary feature \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/5f72424a478f59061dcc516b866dcc687bc3f9de", "ref_desc": "[DS-4133] Improve URL handling in Controlled Vocab JSPUI servlet \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@5f72424 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/f7758457b7ec3489d525e39aa753cc70809d9ad9", "ref_desc": "[DS-4133] Improve URL handling in Controlled Vocab JSPUI servlet \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@f775845 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fKy1n3oNrE9nGsbvhhWJYp5DZiY.html"}]}
