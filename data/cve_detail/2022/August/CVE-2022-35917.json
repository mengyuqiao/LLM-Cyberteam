{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35917", "Description": "Solana Pay is a protocol and set of reference implementations that enable developers to incorporate decentralized payments into their apps and services. When a Solana Pay transaction is located using a reference key, it may be checked to represent a transfer of the desired amount to the recipient, using the supplied `validateTransfer` function. An edge case regarding this mechanism could cause the validation logic to validate multiple transfers. This issue has been patched as of version `0.2.1`. Users of the Solana Pay SDK should upgrade to it. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35917", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolanalabs\u00bbPAYVersions  before (<) 0.2.1cpe:2.3:a:solanalabs:pay:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-22  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2024-01-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-03  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/blob/master/SPEC.md#reference", "ref_desc": "solana-pay/SPEC.md at master \u00b7 solana-labs/solana-pay \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/commit/ac6ce0d0a81137700874a8bf5a7caac3be999fad", "ref_desc": "finish transfer validation implementation \u00b7 solana-labs/solana-pay@ac6ce0d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/security/advisories/GHSA-j47c-j42c-mwqq", "ref_desc": "Weakness in Transfer Validation Logic \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 solana-labs/solana-pay \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/blob/master/core/src/validateTransfer.ts", "ref_desc": "solana-pay/validateTransfer.ts at master \u00b7 solana-labs/solana-pay \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
