{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31191", "Description": "DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. dspace-jspui is a UI component for DSpace. The JSPUI spellcheck \"Did you mean\" HTML escapes the data-spell attribute in the link, but not the actual displayed text. Similarly, the JSPUI autocomplete HTML does not properly escape text passed to it. Both are vulnerable to XSS. This vulnerability only impacts the JSPUI. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31191", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDuraspace\u00bbDspaceVersions  after (>) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.4cpe:2.3:a:duraspace:dspace:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDuraspace\u00bbDspaceVersions  after (>) 4.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.10cpe:2.3:a:duraspace:dspace:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-22  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-01-12  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-06  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-03  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-07-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-c558-5gfm-p2r8", "ref_desc": "Cross Site Scripting (XSS) possible in JSPUI spellcheck and autocomplete tools \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/6f75bb084ab1937d094208c55cd84340040bcbb5", "ref_desc": "[DS-4453] Discovery autocomplete HTML escaping (JSPUI) \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@6f75bb0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/35030a23e48b5946f5853332c797e1c4adea7bb7", "ref_desc": "[DS-4453] Fix XSS handling in JSPUI discovery autocomplete \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@35030a2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/c89e493e517b424dea6175caba54e91d3847fc3a", "ref_desc": "[DS-4453] Escape spellcheck, autocomplete HTML (JSPUI) \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@c89e493 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/ebb83a75234d3de9be129464013e998dc929b68d", "ref_desc": "[DS-4453] Fix XSS handling in JSPUI discovery spellcheck \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@ebb83a7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
