{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-38153", "Description": "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0 (when --enable-session-ticket is used); however, only version 5.3.0 is exploitable. Man-in-the-middle attackers or a malicious server can crash TLS 1.2 clients during a handshake. If an attacker injects a large ticket (more than 256 bytes) into a NewSessionTicket message in a TLS 1.2 handshake, and the client has a non-empty session cache, the session cache frees a pointer that points to unallocated memory, causing the client to crash with a \"free(): invalid pointer\" message. NOTE: It is likely that this is also exploitable during TLS 1.3 handshakes between a client and a malicious server. With TLS 1.3, it is not possible to exploit this as a man-in-the-middle.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38153", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWolfssl\u00bbWolfssl\u00bbVersion:5.3.0cpe:2.3:a:wolfssl:wolfssl:5.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.33%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-21  0.28%  0.34%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-04-07  0.28%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-23  0.24%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-11  0.21%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-12-06  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-09-07  0.12%  0.20%  +0.08 \n 8  2023-08-01  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.10%  -1.01 \n 10  2023-01-21  1.02%  1.11%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/5476", "ref_desc": "Remove WOLFSSL_SESSION_TYPE_REF buffers from WOLFSSL_SESSION by julek-wolfssl \u00b7 Pull Request #5476 \u00b7 wolfSSL/wolfssl \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/", "ref_desc": "Keeping the wolves out of wolfSSL | Trail of Bits BlogThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NBxrO1la6MO1-jWUgPJafkZDJTM.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170605/wolfSSL-5.3.0-Denial-Of-Service.html", "ref_desc": "wolfSSL 5.3.0 Denial Of Service \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trailofbits/tlspuffin", "ref_desc": "GitHub - trailofbits/tlspuffin: A symbolic-model-guided fuzzer for TLSNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 wolfSSL/wolfssl \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s42znnNra2f9tQPou2x-HR_oEiU.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/8", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: wolfSSL 5.3.0: Denial-of-serviceExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "wolfSSL Security Vulnerabilities | wolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS LibraryVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xinqaZrISYAhowaQMjvidDuik6I.html"}]}
