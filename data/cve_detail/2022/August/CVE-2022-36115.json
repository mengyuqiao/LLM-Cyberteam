{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36115", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Blue Prism Enterprise 6.0 through 7.01. In a misconfigured environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for unintended functionality. An attacker can abuse the CreateProcessAutosave() method to inject their own functionality into a development process. If (upon a warning) a user decides to recover unsaved work by using the last saved version, the malicious code could enter the workflow. Should the process action stages not be fully reviewed before publishing, this could result in the malicious code being run in a production environment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36115", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSsctech\u00bbBlue PrismVersions  from including (>=) 6.4andbefore (<) 7.1cpe:2.3:a:ssctech:blue_prism:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-11  0.22%  0.18%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-04-01  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-17  0.18%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-05  0.18%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-01  0.09%  0.18%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-07-26  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-02  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://community.blueprism.com/discussion/security-vulnerability-notification-ssc-blue-prism-enterprise", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerability Notification \u2013 SS&C Blue Prism Enterprise | Blue Prism ProductVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JdRyvyyzsymTACBibVKOIst4rVw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blueprism.com", "ref_desc": "Intelligent Robotic Process Automation - RPA | Blue PrismProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MDRi6tvk6snIVFxiY2YCRtLMIpk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://portal.blueprism.com/security-vulnerabilities-august-2022", "ref_desc": "Access denied | Blue Prism PortalPermissions Required;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZpzEsLR8pJXZ2y778FwC5zOCTeI.html"}]}
