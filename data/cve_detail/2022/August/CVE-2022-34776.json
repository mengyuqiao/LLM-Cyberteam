{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-34776", "Description": "Tabit - giftcard stealth. Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described APIs, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a 'tiny URL' in tabits domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 character long string containing numbers, lower and upper case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-34776", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTabit\u00bbTabitVersions  before (<) 3.27.0cpe:2.3:a:tabit:tabit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-03-13  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-02  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-24  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-08-29  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-07-23  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.gov.il/en/departments/faq/cve_advisories", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/R1tD4TSH1Vu0JGFzV5ebbWHjSb4.html"}]}
