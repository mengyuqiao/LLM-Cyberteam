{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36009", "Description": "gomatrixserverlib is a Go library for matrix protocol federation. Dendrite is a Matrix homeserver written in Go, an alternative to Synapse. The power level parsing within gomatrixserverlib was failing to parse the `\"events_default\"` key of the `m.room.power_levels` event, defaulting the event default power level to zero in all cases. Power levels are the matrix terminology for user access level. In rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level had been changed, this could result in events either being incorrectly authorised or rejected by Dendrite servers. gomatrixserverlib contains a fix as of commit `723fd49` and Dendrite 0.9.3 has been updated accordingly. Matrix rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level has not been changed from the default of zero are not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36009", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbDendriteVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.9.2cpe:2.3:a:matrix:dendrite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMatrix\u00bbGomatrixserverlib\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:matrix:gomatrixserverlib:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-09  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-03-26  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-11  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-30  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-26  0.09%  0.16%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-07-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-26  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/#power-levels", "ref_desc": "Moderation in Matrix | Matrix.orgVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/commit/723fd495dde835d078b9f2074b6b62c06dea4575", "ref_desc": "Fix parsing of `\"events_default\"` level in `m.room.power_levels` events \u00b7 matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib@723fd49 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/security/advisories/GHSA-grvv-h2f9-7v9c", "ref_desc": "Incorrect parsing of the event default power level in event auth \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
