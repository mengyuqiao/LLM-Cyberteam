{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35956", "Description": "This Rails gem adds two methods to the ActiveRecord::Base class that allow you to update many records on a single database hit, using a case sql statement for it. Before version 0.1.3 `update_by_case` gem used custom sql strings, and it was not sanitized, making it vulnerable to sql injection. Upgrade to version >= 0.1.3 that uses `Arel` instead to construct the resulting sql statement, with sanitized sql.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35956", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nUpdate By Case Project\u00bbUpdate By Case\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 0.1.3cpe:2.3:a:update_by_case_project:update_by_case:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-04  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-23  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-09-14  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-19  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-07-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/camilova/activerecord-update-by-case/security/advisories/GHSA-33wh-w4m7-c6r8", "ref_desc": "update_by_case before 0.1.3 can be vulnerable to sql injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 camilova/activerecord-update-by-case \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/camilova/activerecord-update-by-case/releases/tag/v0.1.3-stable", "ref_desc": "Release v0.1.3-stable \u00b7 camilova/activerecord-update-by-case \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
