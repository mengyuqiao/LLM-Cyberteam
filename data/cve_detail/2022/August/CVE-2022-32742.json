Some SMB1 write requests were not correctly range-checked to ensure the client had sent enough data to fulfill the write, allowing server memory contents to be written into the file (or printer) instead of client-supplied data. The client cannot control the area of the server memory written to the file (or printer).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-32742", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSamba\u00bbSambaVersions  from including (>=) 4.15.0andbefore (<) 4.15.9cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSamba\u00bbSambaVersions  before (<) 4.14.14cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSamba\u00bbSambaVersions  from including (>=) 4.16.0andbefore (<) 4.16.4cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.42%  3.17%  -1.25 \n 2  2024-11-01  4.33%  4.42%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-07-24  3.78%  4.33%  +0.55 \n 4  2024-04-23  3.93%  3.78%  -0.15 \n 5  2024-03-17  2.92%  3.93%  +1.01 \n 6  2023-12-27  2.79%  2.92%  +0.13 \n 7  2023-09-17  2.23%  2.79%  +0.56 \n 8  2023-09-01  2.29%  2.23%  -0.06 \n 9  2023-08-07  2.23%  2.29%  +0.06 \n 10  2023-07-26  1.98%  2.23%  +0.25 \n 11  2023-07-02  1.30%  1.98%  +0.69 \n 12  2023-05-25  0.05%  1.30%  +1.25 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00015.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3792-1] samba security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RvAma6-9J1ZLKhmzvJh8wauBDUw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2022-32742.html", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06", "ref_desc": "Samba: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202309-06) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UnQMK1JCRL2hNkmXXhUu9jTTDPY.html"}]}
