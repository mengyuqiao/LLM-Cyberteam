{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31186", "Description": "NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An information disclosure vulnerability in `next-auth` before `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` allows an attacker with log access privilege to obtain excessive information such as an identity provider's secret in the log (which is thrown during OAuth error handling) and use it to leverage further attacks on the system, like impersonating the client to ask for extensive permissions. This issue has been patched in `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` by moving the log for `provider` information to the debug level. In addition, we added a warning for having the `debug: true` option turned on in production. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can user the `logger` configuration option by sanitizing the logs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31186", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nNext-auth\u00bbNextauth.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.29.9cpe:2.3:a:next-auth:nextauth.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nNext-auth\u00bbNextauth.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.10.2cpe:2.3:a:next-auth:nextauth.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://next-auth.js.org/warnings#debug_enabled", "ref_desc": "Warnings | NextAuth.jsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-p6mm-27gq-9v3p", "ref_desc": "Leakage of excessive information into log in next-auth \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextauthjs/next-auth \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#logger", "ref_desc": "Options | NextAuth.jsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4", "ref_desc": "Upgrade Guide (v4) | NextAuth.jsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tsG6p_vYvvzw7iuygwnn6d5OYCg.html"}]}
