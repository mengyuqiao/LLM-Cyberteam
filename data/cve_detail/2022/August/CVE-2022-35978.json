{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35978", "Description": "Minetest is a free open-source voxel game engine with easy modding and game creation. In **single player**, a mod can set a global setting that controls the Lua script loaded to display the main menu. The script is then loaded as soon as the game session is exited. The Lua environment the menu runs in is not sandboxed and can directly interfere with the user's system. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35978", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMinetest\u00bbMinetestVersions  before (<) 5.6.0cpe:2.3:a:minetest:minetest:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-05  0.19%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-03-22  0.19%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-07  0.18%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-01-26  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-17  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-22  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-07-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minetest/minetest/commit/da71e86633d0b27cd02d7aac9fdac625d141ca13", "ref_desc": "Protect a few more settings from being set from mods \u00b7 minetest/minetest@da71e86 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://dev.minetest.net/Changelog#5.5.0_.E2.86.92_5.6.0", "ref_desc": "Changelog - Minetest Developer WikiRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minetest/minetest/security/advisories/GHSA-663q-pcjw-27cc", "ref_desc": "Singleplayer: Lua sandbox escape from mod \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minetest/minetest \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
