{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30318", "Description": "Honeywell ControlEdge through R151.1 uses Hard-coded Credentials. According to FSCT-2022-0056, there is a Honeywell ControlEdge hardcoded credentials issue. The affected components are characterized as: SSH. The potential impact is: Remote code execution, manipulate configuration, denial of service. The Honeywell ControlEdge PLC and RTU product line exposes an SSH service on port 22/TCP. Login as root to this service is permitted and credentials for the root user are hardcoded without automatically changing them upon first commissioning. The credentials for the SSH service are hardcoded in the firmware. The credentials grant an attacker access to a root shell on the PLC/RTU, allowing for remote code execution, configuration manipulation and denial of service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30318", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nHoneywell\u00bbControledge Plc FirmwareVersions  before (<) r151.2cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:controledge_plc_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Honeywell\u00bbControledge Plc\u00bbVersion:N/A\nHoneywell\u00bbControledge Rtu FirmwareVersions  before (<) r151.2cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:controledge_rtu_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Honeywell\u00bbControledge Rtu\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "8.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.45%  8.29%  +7.84 \n 2  2024-11-22  0.38%  0.45%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-08-15  0.34%  0.38%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.33%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-23  0.31%  0.33%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-02-11  0.31%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-10-03  0.27%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-08-01  0.24%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.89%  0.24%  -1.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-242-06", "ref_desc": "Honeywell ControlEdge | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
