{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29550", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Qualys Cloud Agent 4.8.0-49. It writes \"ps auxwwe\" output to the /var/log/qualys/qualys-cloud-agent-scan.log file. This may, for example, unexpectedly write credentials (from environment variables) to disk in cleartext. NOTE: there are no common circumstances in which qualys-cloud-agent-scan.log can be read by a user other than root; however, the file contents could be exposed through site-specific operational practices. The vendor does NOT characterize this as a vulnerability because the ps data collection is intentional, and would only capture credentials on a machine that was already affected by the CWE-214 weakness", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29550", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nQualys\u00bbCloud Agent\u00bbVersion:4.8.0-49ForLinuxcpe:2.3:a:qualys:cloud_agent:4.8.0-49:*:*:*:*:linux:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Sep/10", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Multiple vulnerabilities discovered in Qualys Cloud AgentMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2cqziKBpkz2aGkbH5IDgl7kFQds.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168367/Qualys-Cloud-Agent-Arbitrary-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Qualys Cloud Agent Arbitrary Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AMZYf3RujEhMSMDuaryLd3w5CAg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research", "ref_desc": "Category: Vulnerabilities and Threat Research | Qualys Security BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HKaPV8Qu-hJ0sdMIFAQcnLOjV98.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2022/08/15/qualys-security-updates-cloud-agent-for-linux", "ref_desc": "Qualys Security Updates: Cloud Agent for Linux | Qualys Security BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PRmChHx16HQqiq4FmBEYjlCv-1o.html"}]}
