{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31180", "Description": "Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Affected versions were found to have insufficient escaping of white space when interpolating output. This issue only impacts users that use the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. The result is that if an attacker is able to include whitespace in their input they can: 1. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted directly after whitespace. 2. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted or appearing after line terminating characters. 3. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a line feed character. 4. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a carriage return character. Behaviour number 1 has been patched in [v1.5.7] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Behaviour number 2, 3, and 4 have been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. The best workaround is to avoid having to use the `interpolation: true` option - in most cases using an alternative is possible, see [the recipes](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape#recipes) for recommendations. Alternatively, users may strip all whitespace from user input. Note that this is error prone, for example: for PowerShell this requires stripping `'\\u0085'` which is not included in JavaScript's definition of `\\s` for Regular Expressions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31180", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShescape Project\u00bbShescapeVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.5.8cpe:2.3:a:shescape_project:shescape:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.33%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-10-23  0.28%  0.36%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-03-22  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-03-08  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-02-22  0.19%  0.19%  0.00 \n 6  2024-01-12  0.16%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-11-06  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-09-03  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-08-08  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 10  2023-07-02  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/324", "ref_desc": "Escaping for Unix shells after whitespace with `{interpolation:true}` by ericcornelissen \u00b7 Pull Request #324 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-44vr-rwwj-p88h", "ref_desc": "Insufficient escaping of whitespace \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.7", "ref_desc": "Release Release v1.5.7 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/322", "ref_desc": "Escaping for PowerShell after whitespace with `{interpolation:true}` by ericcornelissen \u00b7 Pull Request #322 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8", "ref_desc": "Release Release v1.5.8 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vPYvHGUQ7GdXYleUvsliZ7YdfEs.html"}]}
