{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35980", "Description": "OpenSearch Security is a plugin for OpenSearch that offers encryption, authentication and authorization. Versions 2.0.0.0 and 2.1.0.0 of the security plugin are affected by an information disclosure vulnerability. Requests to an OpenSearch cluster configured with advanced access control features document level security (DLS), field level security (FLS), and/or field masking will not be filtered when the query's search pattern matches an aliased index. OpenSearch Dashboards creates an alias to `.kibana` by default, so filters with the index pattern of `*` to restrict access to documents or fields will not be applied. This issue allows requests to access sensitive information when customer have acted to restrict access that specific information. OpenSearch 2.2.0, which is compatible with OpenSearch Security 2.2.0.0, contains the fix for this issue. There is no recommended work around.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35980", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbVersion:2.0.0ForDockercpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbVersion:2.1.0ForDockercpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:2.1.0:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-04  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-23  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-14  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-19  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-13  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-612 Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/612/Improper-Authorization-of-Index-Containing-Sensitive-Informa.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-f4qr-f4xx-hjxw", "ref_desc": "Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information in OpenSearch \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/security \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/commit/7eaaafec2939d7db23a02ffca9cc68e0343de246", "ref_desc": "Update release notes for 2.2.0.0 release (#1984) \u00b7 opensearch-project/security@7eaaafe \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/pull/1999", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2022-35980] Ensure concrete indexes included during index resolution for DLS/FLS/Masking checks by peternied \u00b7 Pull Request #1999 \u00b7 opensearch-project/security \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
