{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36008", "Description": "Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. A security issue was discovered affecting parsing of the RPC result of the exit reason in case of EVM reversion. In release build, this would cause the exit reason being incorrectly parsed and returned by RPC. In debug build, this would cause an overflow panic. No action is needed unless you have a bridge node that needs to distinguish different reversion exit reasons and you used RPC for this. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36008", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nParity\u00bbFrontier\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:parity:frontier:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-04-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-26  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-11  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-26  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-07-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/commit/fff8cc43b7756ce3979a38fc473f38e6e24ac451", "ref_desc": "Fix length checking overflow in EVM revert reason parsing (#820) \u00b7 paritytech/frontier@fff8cc4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/820", "ref_desc": "Fix length checking overflow in EVM revert reason parsing by sorpaas \u00b7 Pull Request #820 \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/security/advisories/GHSA-mjvm-mhgc-q4gp", "ref_desc": "Incorrect parsing of EVM reversion exit reason in RPC \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
