{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-38152", "Description": "An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. When a TLS 1.3 client connects to a wolfSSL server and SSL_clear is called on its session, the server crashes with a segmentation fault. This occurs in the second session, which is created through TLS session resumption and reuses the initial struct WOLFSSL. If the server reuses the previous session structure (struct WOLFSSL) by calling wolfSSL_clear(WOLFSSL* ssl) on it, the next received Client Hello (that resumes the previous session) crashes the server. Note that this bug is only triggered when resuming sessions using TLS session resumption. Only servers that use wolfSSL_clear instead of the recommended SSL_free; SSL_new sequence are affected. Furthermore, wolfSSL_clear is part of wolfSSL's compatibility layer and is not enabled by default. It is not part of wolfSSL's native API.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38152", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nWolfssl\u00bbWolfsslVersions  before (<) 5.5.0cpe:2.3:a:wolfssl:wolfssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.52%  0.56%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-22  0.41%  0.52%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-04-21  0.34%  0.41%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.33%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-23  0.29%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-02-11  0.25%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-12-06  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-10-03  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-09-07  0.12%  0.20%  +0.08 \n 10  2023-08-01  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.10%  -1.01 \n 12  2023-01-21  1.02%  1.11%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/7", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: wolfSSL before 5.5.0: Denial-of-service with session resumptionExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/", "ref_desc": "Keeping the wolves out of wolfSSL | Trail of Bits BlogThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NBxrO1la6MO1-jWUgPJafkZDJTM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 wolfSSL/wolfssl \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s42znnNra2f9tQPou2x-HR_oEiU.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170604/wolfSSL-Session-Resumption-Denial-Of-Service.html", "ref_desc": "wolfSSL Session Resumption Denial Of Service \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "wolfSSL Security Vulnerabilities | wolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS LibraryVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xinqaZrISYAhowaQMjvidDuik6I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/5468", "ref_desc": "Fixes to better handle re-use of a WOLFSSL object via wolfSSL_clear by SparkiDev \u00b7 Pull Request #5468 \u00b7 wolfSSL/wolfssl \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tlspuffin/tlspuffin", "ref_desc": "GitHub - tlspuffin/tlspuffin: A symbolic-model-guided fuzzer for TLSNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
