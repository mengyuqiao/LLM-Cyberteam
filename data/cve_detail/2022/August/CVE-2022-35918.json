{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35918", "Description": "Streamlit is a data oriented application development framework for python. Users hosting Streamlit app(s) that use custom components are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack that could leak data from their web server file-system such as: server logs, world readable files, and potentially other sensitive information. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with file paths and the streamlit server would process that URL and return the contents of that file. This issue has been resolved in version 1.11.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35918", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nSnowflake\u00bbStreamlitVersions  from including (>=) 0.63.0andbefore (<) 1.11.1cpe:2.3:a:snowflake:streamlit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-01-12  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-03  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-08  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-02  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/security/advisories/GHSA-v4hr-4jpx-56gc", "ref_desc": "Streamlit directory traversal vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 streamlit/streamlit \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/commit/80d9979d5f4a00217743d607078a1d867fad8acf", "ref_desc": "Ignore component requests outside of the component root \u00b7 streamlit/streamlit@80d9979 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
