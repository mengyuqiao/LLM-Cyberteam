{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-38130", "Description": "The com.keysight.tentacle.config.ResourceManager.smsRestoreDatabaseZip() method is used to restore the HSQLDB database used in SMS. It takes the path of the zipped database file as the single parameter. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can specify an UNC path for the database file (i.e., \\\\<attacker-host>\\sms\\<attacker-db.zip>), effectively controlling the content of the database to be restored.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38130", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nKeysight\u00bbSensor Management Server\u00bbVersion:2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:keysight:sensor_management_server:2.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.44%  0.29%  -0.15 \n 2  2024-11-01  0.39%  0.44%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-07-25  0.37%  0.39%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-03-17  0.34%  0.37%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-03-02  0.30%  0.34%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-01-21  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-09-12  0.27%  0.27%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-08-17  0.17%  0.27%  +0.10 \n 9  2023-07-11  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2022-28", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8pCmLZCkIRFwp-RU_3dDHtE8zhk.html"}]}
