{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35932", "Description": "Nextcloud Talk is a video and audio conferencing app for Nextcloud. Prior to versions 12.2.7, 13.0.7, and 14.0.3, password protected conversations are susceptible to brute force attacks if the attacker has the link/conversation token. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application is upgraded to 12.2.7, 13.0.7 or 14.0.3. There are currently no known workarounds available apart from not having password protected conversations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35932", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbTalkVersions  before (<) 12.2.7cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbTalkVersions  from including (>=) 13.0.0andbefore (<) 13.0.7cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbTalkVersions  from including (>=) 14.0.0andbefore (<) 14.0.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.14%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-03-04  0.21%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-01-23  0.17%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-11-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-14  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-19  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-07-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.54%  0.08%  -1.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-359 Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/359/Exposure-of-Private-Personal-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/7537", "ref_desc": "[stable22] Add brute force protection to conversation passwords by nickvergessen \u00b7 Pull Request #7537 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/commit/f5ac73940f9f683b11e518d1c54150bf50dab9be", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #7541 from nextcloud/changelog/12.2.7 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed@f5ac739 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-pf36-jvpv-4hwq", "ref_desc": "Missing rate limit when trying to join a password protected Nextcloud Talk conversation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/commit/04300bbed0e87ff3420b5d752bbc48e2c15f35e9", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #7540 from nextcloud/changelog/12.2.7-13.0.7 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed@04300bb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1596673", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud | Report #1596673 - Lack of Brute force protection while joining video call in talk section which is password protected | HackerOneIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/commit/10341b9fe59a44ae0d139c072abd6b5026f33771", "ref_desc": "Add changelog for 12.2.7, 13.0.7 and 14.0.3 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed@10341b9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/7504", "ref_desc": "Add brute force protection to conversation passwords by nickvergessen \u00b7 Pull Request #7504 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/7536", "ref_desc": "[stable23] Add brute force protection to conversation passwords by backportbot-nextcloud[bot] \u00b7 Pull Request #7536 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/7535", "ref_desc": "[stable24] Add brute force protection to conversation passwords by backportbot-nextcloud[bot] \u00b7 Pull Request #7535 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
