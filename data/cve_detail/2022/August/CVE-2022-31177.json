{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31177", "Description": "Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework built on top of Flask python framework. In versions prior to 4.1.3 an authenticated Admin user could query other users by their salted and hashed passwords strings. These filters could be made by using partial hashed password strings. The response would not include the hashed passwords, but an attacker could infer partial password hashes and their respective users. This issue has been fixed in version 4.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31177", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFlask-appbuilder Project\u00bbFlask-appbuilderVersions  before (<) 4.1.3cpe:2.3:a:flask-appbuilder_project:flask-appbuilder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-02  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/security/advisories/GHSA-32ff-4g79-vgfc", "ref_desc": "Possible to infer sensitive information through query strings \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/releases/tag/v4.1.3", "ref_desc": "Release 4.1.3 \u00b7 dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
