{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31154", "Description": "Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. It is possible for an authenticated Sourcegraph user to edit the Code Monitors owned by any other Sourcegraph user. This includes being able to edit both the trigger and the action of the monitor in question. An attacker is not able to read contents of existing code monitors, only override the data. The issue is fixed in Sourcegraph 3.42. There are no workaround for the issue and patching is highly recommended.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31154", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSourcegraph\u00bbSourcegraphVersions  before (<) 3.42.0cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:sourcegraph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-02  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-5866-hhq9-9hpc", "ref_desc": "Indirect Object Access in Sourcegraph Code Monitoring \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/37526", "ref_desc": "Code monitors: fix issue with action/trigger perms checking by camdencheek \u00b7 Pull Request #37526 \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
