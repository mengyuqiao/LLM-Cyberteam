{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35961", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The functions `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` are vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single `bytes` argument, and not the functions that take `r, v, s` or `r, vs` as separate arguments. The potentially affected contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection. The issue has been patched in 4.7.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35961", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.7.3cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts Upgradeable\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.7.3cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts_upgradeable:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-06  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-08-20  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-14  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-354 Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/354/Improper-Validation-of-Integrity-Check-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.7.3", "ref_desc": "Release v4.7.3 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h", "ref_desc": "ECDSA signature malleability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3610", "ref_desc": "Fix ECDSA signature malleability by frangio \u00b7 Pull Request #3610 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
