{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35926", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. Because of insufficient validation of IPv6 neighbor discovery options in Contiki-NG, attackers can send neighbor solicitation packets that trigger an out-of-bounds read. The problem exists in the module os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c, where memory read operations from the main packet buffer, <code>uip_buf</code>, are not checked if they go out of bounds. In particular, this problem can occur when attempting to read the 2-byte option header and the Source Link-Layer Address Option (SLLAO). This attack requires ipv6 be enabled for the network. The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG. The upcoming 4.8 release of Contiki-NG will include the patch.Users unable to upgrade may apply the patch in Contiki-NG PR #1654.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35926", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  before (<) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-25  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-11  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-25  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 4  2024-01-15  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-06  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-11  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-07-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/releases/tag/release%2Fv4.8", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6DmKreAaheuYxGl1s52eDnq5lM4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1654", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1654/commits/a4597001d50a04f4b9c78f323ba731e2f979802c", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-4hpq-4f53-w386", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
