{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31194", "Description": "DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. dspace-jspui is a UI component for DSpace. The JSPUI resumable upload implementations in SubmissionController and FileUploadRequest are vulnerable to multiple path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to create files/directories anywhere on the server writable by the Tomcat/DSpace user, by modifying some request parameters during submission. This path traversal can only be executed by a user with special privileges (submitter rights). This vulnerability only impacts the JSPUI. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds. However, this vulnerability cannot be exploited by an anonymous user or a basic user. The user must first have submitter privileges to at least one Collection and be able to determine how to modify the request parameters to exploit the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31194", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDuraspace\u00bbDspaceVersions  after (>) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.4cpe:2.3:a:duraspace:dspace:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDuraspace\u00bbDspaceVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.10cpe:2.3:a:duraspace:dspace:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-22  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-08  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-22  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-12  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-08  0.08%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-07-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/d1dd7d23329ef055069759df15cfa200c8e3", "ref_desc": "[DS-4132] JPSUI resumable upload dir validation \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@d1dd7d2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-qp5m-c3m9-8q2p", "ref_desc": "Path traversal vulnerabilities in JSPUI submission (resumable) upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/7569c6374aefeafb996e202cf8d631020eda5f24", "ref_desc": "[DS-4132] Fix JSPUI resumable upload path traversal \u00b7 DSpace/DSpace@7569c63 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
