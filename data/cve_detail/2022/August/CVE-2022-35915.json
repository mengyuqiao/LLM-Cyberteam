{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35915", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The target contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost. The issue has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35915", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 4.7.2cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbOpenzeppelin-solidity\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:openzeppelin-solidity:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbOpenzeppelin-eth\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:openzeppelin-eth:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts Upgradeable\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 4.7.2cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts_upgradeable:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-22  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-12  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-03  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3587", "ref_desc": "Avoid returnbomb in ERC165Checker by Amxx \u00b7 Pull Request #3587 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-7grf-83vw-6f5x", "ref_desc": "ERC165Checker unbounded gas consumption \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
