{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35925", "Description": "BookWyrm is a social network for tracking reading. Versions prior to 0.4.5 were found to lack rate limiting on authentication views which allows brute-force attacks. This issue has been patched in version 0.4.5. Admins with existing instances will need to update their `nginx.conf` file that was created when the instance was set up. Users are advised advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may update their nginx.conf files with the changes manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35925", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nJoinbookwyrm\u00bbBookwyrmVersions  before (<) 0.4.5cpe:2.3:a:joinbookwyrm:bookwyrm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.41%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-10-24  0.24%  0.31%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-03-23  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-03-09  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-02-23  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-01-13  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-09-04  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-08-09  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-07-03  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/commit/7bbe42fb30a79a26115524d18b697d895563c92f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2230 from bookwyrm-social/nginx-rate-limit \u00b7 bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm@7bbe42f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/ebee593d-3fd0-4985-bf5e-7e7927e08bf6/", "ref_desc": "Account Takeover vulnerability found in bookwyrmExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/security/advisories/GHSA-jvp3-mqv8-5rjw", "ref_desc": "Missing Critical Step in Authentication in bookwyrm \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
