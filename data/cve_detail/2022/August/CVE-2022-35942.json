{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35942", "Description": "Improper input validation on the `contains` LoopBack filter may allow for arbitrary SQL injection. When the extended filter property `contains` is permitted to be interpreted by the Postgres connector, it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on the connected database. A patch was released in version 5.5.1. This affects users who does any of the following: - Connect to the database via the DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties: true` setting OR - Uses the connector's CRUD methods directly OR - Uses the connector's other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable to upgrade should do the following if applicable: - Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true` DataSource setting - Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When passing directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for the `contains` LoopBack filter beforehand.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35942", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbLoopback-connector-postgresql\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.5.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:loopback-connector-postgresql:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-04  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-23  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-09-14  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-19  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-07-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql/commit/d57406c6737692a3a106b58a35406290cddb23e5", "ref_desc": "fix: improve filter sanitisation \u00b7 loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql@d57406c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql/security/advisories/GHSA-j259-6c58-9m58", "ref_desc": "Improper Sanitization of `contains` Filter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
