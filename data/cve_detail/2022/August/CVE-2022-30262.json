{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30262", "Description": "The Emerson ControlWave 'Next Generation' RTUs through 2022-05-02 mishandle firmware integrity. They utilize the BSAP-IP protocol to transmit firmware updates. Firmware updates are supplied as CAB archive files containing a binary firmware image. In all cases, firmware images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30262", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEmerson\u00bbControlwave Micro FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2022-05-02cpe:2.3:o:emerson:controlwave_micro_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Emerson\u00bbControlwave Micro\u00bbVersion:N/A\nEmerson\u00bbControlwave Pac FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2022-05-02cpe:2.3:o:emerson:controlwave_pac_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Emerson\u00bbControlwave Pac\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-09  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-221-02", "ref_desc": "Mitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
