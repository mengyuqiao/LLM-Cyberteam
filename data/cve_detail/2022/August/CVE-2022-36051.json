{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36051", "Description": "ZITADEL combines the ease of Auth0 and the versatility of Keycloak.**Actions**, introduced in ZITADEL **1.42.0** on the API and **1.56.0** for Console, is a feature, where users with role.`ORG_OWNER` are able to create Javascript Code, which is invoked by the system at certain points during the login. **Actions**, for example, allow creating authorizations (user grants) on newly created users programmatically. Due to a missing authorization check, **Actions** were able to grant authorizations for projects that belong to other organizations inside the same Instance. Granting authorizations via API and Console is not affected by this vulnerability. There is currently no known workaround, users should update.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36051", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  from including (>=) 1.42.0andbefore (<) 1.87.1cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.0cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-07  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-23  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-11  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-07  0.08%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-08-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.2.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.2.0 \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v1.87.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.87.1 \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-c8fj-4pm8-mp2c", "ref_desc": "Broken Authorization in ZITADEL Actions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
