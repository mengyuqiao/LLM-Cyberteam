{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35949", "Description": "undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js.`undici` is vulnerable to SSRF (Server-side Request Forgery) when an application takes in **user input** into the `path/pathname` option of `undici.request`. If a user specifies a URL such as `http://127.0.0.1` or `//127.0.0.1` ```js const undici = require(\"undici\") undici.request({origin: \"http://example.com\", pathname: \"//127.0.0.1\"}) ``` Instead of processing the request as `http://example.org//127.0.0.1` (or `http://example.org/http://127.0.0.1` when `http://127.0.0.1 is used`), it actually processes the request as `http://127.0.0.1/` and sends it to `http://127.0.0.1`. If a developer passes in user input into `path` parameter of `undici.request`, it can result in an _SSRF_ as they will assume that the hostname cannot change, when in actual fact it can change because the specified path parameter is combined with the base URL. This issue was fixed in `undici@5.8.1`. The best workaround is to validate user input before passing it to the `undici.request` call.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35949", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbUndici\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.8.1cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:undici:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.31%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-03  0.23%  0.29%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-04-02  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-03-19  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-03-04  0.16%  0.15%  0.00 \n 6  2024-01-23  0.14%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-08-19  0.07%  0.14%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-07-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nodejs/undici/commit/124f7ebf705366b2e1844dff721928d270f87895", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8qr4-xgw6-wmr3 \u00b7 nodejs/undici@124f7eb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-8qr4-xgw6-wmr3", "ref_desc": "`undici.request` vulnerable to SSRF using absolute URL on `pathname` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nodejs/undici \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v5.8.2", "ref_desc": "Release v5.8.2 \u00b7 nodejs/undici \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hprsz1DCSHCNyy_qVfnUIw6itwA.html"}]}
