{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35927", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. In the RPL-Classic routing protocol implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system, an incoming DODAG Information Option (DIO) control message can contain a prefix information option with a length parameter. The value of the length parameter is not validated, however, and it is possible to cause a buffer overflow when copying the prefix in the set_ip_from_prefix function. This vulnerability affects anyone running a Contiki-NG version prior to 4.7 that can receive RPL DIO messages from external parties. To obtain a patched version, users should upgrade to Contiki-NG 4.7 or later. There are no workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35927", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  before (<) 4.7cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-25  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-11  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-25  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-01-15  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-06  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-11  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-07-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-9rm9-3phh-p4wm", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1589/commits/4fffab0e632c4d01910fa957d1fd9ef321eb87d2", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1589", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
