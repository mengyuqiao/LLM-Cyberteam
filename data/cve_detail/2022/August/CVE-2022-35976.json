{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35976", "Description": "The GitOps Tools Extension for VSCode relies on kubeconfigs in order to communicate with Kubernetes clusters. A specially crafted kubeconfig leads to arbitrary code execution on behalf of the user running VSCode. Users relying on kubeconfigs that are generated or altered by other processes or users are affected by this issue. Please note that the vulnerability is specific to this extension, and the same kubeconfig would not result in arbitrary code execution when used with kubectl. Using only trust-worthy kubeconfigs is a safe mitigation. However, updating to the latest version of the extension is still highly recommended.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35976", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWeave\u00bbGitops Tools\u00bbForVisual Studio CodeVersions  from including (>=) 0.5.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.20.9cpe:2.3:a:weave:gitops_tools:*:*:*:*:*:visual_studio_code:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.25%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-03-10  0.28%  0.26%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-01-29  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-09-20  0.25%  0.25%  0.00 \n 5  2023-08-25  0.16%  0.25%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-07-19  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.14%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/weaveworks/vscode-gitops-tools/security/advisories/GHSA-287h-vjhw-jqf7", "ref_desc": "Improper KubeConfig handling allows arbitrary code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 weaveworks/vscode-gitops-tools \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
