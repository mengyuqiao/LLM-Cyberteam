{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29549", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Qualys Cloud Agent 4.8.0-49. It executes programs at various full pathnames without first making ownership and permission checks (e.g., to help ensure that a program was installed by root) and without integrity checks (e.g., a checksum comparison against known legitimate programs). Also, the vendor recommendation is to install this agent software with root privileges. Thus, privilege escalation is possible on systems where any of these pathnames is controlled by a non-root user. An example is /opt/firebird/bin/isql, where the /opt/firebird directory is often owned by the firebird user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29549", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nQualys\u00bbCloud Agent For LinuxVersions  before (<) 2.5.548.2cpe:2.3:a:qualys:cloud_agent_for_linux:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-23  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-354 Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/354/Improper-Validation-of-Integrity-Check-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Sep/10", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Multiple vulnerabilities discovered in Qualys Cloud AgentMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2cqziKBpkz2aGkbH5IDgl7kFQds.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168367/Qualys-Cloud-Agent-Arbitrary-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Qualys Cloud Agent Arbitrary Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AMZYf3RujEhMSMDuaryLd3w5CAg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research", "ref_desc": "Category: Vulnerabilities and Threat Research | Qualys Security BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HKaPV8Qu-hJ0sdMIFAQcnLOjV98.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://software.firstworks.com/p/getting-started-with-firebird.html", "ref_desc": "firstworks software and systems: Getting Started with FirebirdNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2022/08/15/qualys-security-updates-cloud-agent-for-linux", "ref_desc": "Qualys Security Updates: Cloud Agent for Linux | Qualys Security BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PRmChHx16HQqiq4FmBEYjlCv-1o.html"}]}
