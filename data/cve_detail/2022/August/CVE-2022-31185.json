{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31185", "Description": "mprweb is a hosting platform for the makedeb Package Repository. Email addresses were found to not have been hidden, even if a user had clicked the `Hide Email Address` checkbox on their account page, or during signup. This could lead to an account's email being leaked, which may be problematic if your email needs to remain private for any reason. Users hosting their own mprweb instance will need to upgrade to the latest commit to get this fixed. Users on the official instance will already have this issue fixed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31185", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMakedp\u00bbMprwebVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:makedp:mprweb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-22  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-02  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/makedeb/mprweb/commit/d13e3f2f5a9c0b0f6782f35d837090732026ad77", "ref_desc": "Redis and Hide Email Address fixes \u00b7 makedeb/mprweb@d13e3f2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/makedeb/mprweb/security/advisories/GHSA-jm39-h693-678g", "ref_desc": "Email addresses are not hidden, regardless of selected state \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 makedeb/mprweb \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
