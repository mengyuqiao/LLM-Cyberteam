{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35930", "Description": "PolicyController is a utility used to enforce supply chain policy in Kubernetes clusters. In versions prior to 0.2.1 PolicyController will report a false positive, resulting in an admission when it should not be admitted when there is at least one attestation with a valid signature and there are NO attestations of the type being verified (--type defaults to \"custom\"). An example image that can be used to test this is `ghcr.io/distroless/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2`. Users should upgrade to version 0.2.1 to resolve this issue. There are no workarounds for users unable to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35930", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSigstore\u00bbPolicy ControllerVersions  before (<) 0.2.1cpe:2.3:a:sigstore:policy_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-25  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-11  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-25  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-15  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-11  0.08%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-07-05  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-11  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller/releases/tag/v0.2.1", "ref_desc": "Release v0.2.1 \u00b7 sigstore/policy-controller \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller/commit/e852af36fb7d42678b21d7e97503c25bd1fd05c8", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-739f-hw6h-7wq8 \u00b7 sigstore/policy-controller@e852af3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller/security/advisories/GHSA-739f-hw6h-7wq8", "ref_desc": "Ability to bypass attestation verification \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sigstore/policy-controller \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
