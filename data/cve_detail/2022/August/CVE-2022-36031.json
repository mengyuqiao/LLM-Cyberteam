{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36031", "Description": "Directus is a free and open-source data platform for headless content management. The Directus process can be aborted by having an authorized user update the `filename_disk` value to a folder and accessing that file through the `/assets` endpoint. This vulnerability has been patched and release v9.15.0 contains the fix. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may prevent this problem by making sure no (untrusted) non-admin users have permissions to update the `filename_disk` field on `directus_files`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36031", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMonospace\u00bbDirectusVersions  before (<) 9.15.0cpe:2.3:a:monospace:directus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-03-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-26  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-77qm-wvqq-fg79", "ref_desc": "Unhandled exception on illegal filename_disk value \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
