{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35929", "Description": "cosign is a container signing and verification utility. In versions prior to 1.10.1 cosign can report a false positive if any attestation exists. `cosign verify-attestation` used with the `--type` flag will report a false positive verification when there is at least one attestation with a valid signature and there are NO attestations of the type being verified (--type defaults to \"custom\"). This can happen when signing with a standard keypair and with \"keyless\" signing with Fulcio. This vulnerability can be reproduced with the `distroless.dev/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2` image. This image has a `vuln` attestation but not an `spdx` attestation. However, if you run `cosign verify-attestation --type=spdx` on this image, it incorrectly succeeds. This issue has been addressed in version 1.10.1 of cosign. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35929", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSigstore\u00bbCosignVersions  before (<) 1.10.1cpe:2.3:a:sigstore:cosign:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.33%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-02-25  0.22%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-01-15  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-06  0.17%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-11  0.13%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-07-05  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commit/c5fda01a8ff33ca981f45a9f13e7fb6bd2080b94", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vjxv-45g9-9296 \u00b7 sigstore/cosign@c5fda01 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-vjxv-45g9-9296", "ref_desc": "`cosign verify-attestation --type` can report a false positive if any attestation exists \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sigstore/cosign \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
