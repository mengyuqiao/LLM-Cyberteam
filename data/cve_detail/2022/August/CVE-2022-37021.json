{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-37021", "Description": "Apache Geode versions up to 1.12.5, 1.13.4 and 1.14.0 are vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 8. Any user still on Java 8 who wishes to protect against deserialization attacks involving JMX or RMI should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15 and Java 11. If upgrading to Java 11 is not possible, then upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15 and specify \"--J=-Dgeode.enableGlobalSerialFilter=true\" when starting any Locators or Servers. Follow the documentation for details on specifying any user classes that may be serialized/deserialized with the \"serializable-object-filter\" configuration option. Using a global serial filter will impact performance.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37021", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbGeodeVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.13.4cpe:2.3:a:apache:geode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbGeodeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.12.5cpe:2.3:a:apache:geode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbGeode\u00bbVersion:1.14.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:geode:1.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "24.91% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-10  21.21%  24.91%  +3.69 \n 2  2024-09-26  19.23%  21.21%  +1.99 \n 3  2024-07-30  7.94%  19.23%  +11.28 \n 4  2024-03-23  7.91%  7.94%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-11  4.26%  7.91%  +3.66 \n 6  2024-01-29  4.14%  4.26%  +0.12 \n 7  2024-01-15  4.09%  4.14%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-10-03  3.80%  4.09%  +0.29 \n 9  2023-09-07  2.59%  3.80%  +1.21 \n 10  2023-05-08  3.63%  2.59%  -1.04 \n 11  2023-03-08  2.59%  3.63%  +1.04 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.89%  2.59%  +1.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/qrvhmytsshsk5xcb68pwccw3y6m8o8nr", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-37021: Apache Geode deserialization of untrusted data flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 8.-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
