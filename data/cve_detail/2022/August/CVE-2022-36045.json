{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36045", "Description": "NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36045", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNodebb\u00bbNodebbVersions  before (<) 1.19.8cpe:2.3:a:nodebb:nodebb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodebb\u00bbNodebb\u00bbVersion:2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:nodebb:nodebb:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-07  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-03-23  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-02-11  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-03  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-09-07  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-08-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/81e3c1ba488d03371a5ce8d0ebb5c5803026e0f9", "ref_desc": "fix: get rid of math.random in generateUUID \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB@81e3c1b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/e802fab87f94a13f397f04cfe6068f2f7ddf7888", "ref_desc": "fix: get rid of math.random in utils.generateUUID \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB@e802fab \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-p4cc-w597-6cpm", "ref_desc": "Account takeover via cryptographically weak PRNG in `utils.generateUUID` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
