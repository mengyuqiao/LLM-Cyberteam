{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-34770", "Description": "Tabit - sensitive information disclosure. Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-34770", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTabit\u00bbTabitVersions  before (<) 3.27.0cpe:2.3:a:tabit:tabit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-09  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-02  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-24  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-29  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-23  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.gov.il/en/departments/faq/cve_advisories", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/R1tD4TSH1Vu0JGFzV5ebbWHjSb4.html"}]}
