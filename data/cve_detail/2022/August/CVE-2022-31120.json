{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31120", "Description": "Nextcloud server is an open source personal cloud solution. The audit log is used to get a full trail of the actions which has been incompletely populated. In affected versions federated share events were not properly logged which would allow brute force attacks to go unnoticed. This behavior exacerbates the impact of CVE-2022-31118. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.7, 23.0.4 or 24.0.0. There are no workarounds available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31120", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 22.2.7cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 23.0.0andbefore (<) 23.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-11  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-778 Insufficient Logging", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/778/Insufficient-Logging.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/31594/commits/1d8bf9a89c6856218802a1d365000a5831be8655", "ref_desc": "Log in audit log federated shares events by CarlSchwan \u00b7 Pull Request #31594 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-9qvg-7fwg-722x", "ref_desc": "Federated share accepting/declining is not logged in audit log \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/using-the-audit-log-44.html", "ref_desc": "Using the audit logVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
