{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23635", "Description": "Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In affected versions the Istio control plane, `istiod`, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. Limiting network access to Istiod to the minimal set of clients can help lessen the scope of the vulnerability to some extent.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23635", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  before (<) 1.11.7cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.1cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.4cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-28  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-02  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-15  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-01  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-09-15  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-08-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-27  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/istio/commit/5f3b5ed958ae75156f8656fe7b3794f78e94db84", "ref_desc": "[release-1.13] Harden validation of untrusted inputs (#90) (#96) \u00b7 istio/istio@5f3b5ed \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2022-003", "ref_desc": "Istio / ISTIO-SECURITY-2022-003Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/istio/security/advisories/GHSA-856q-xv3c-7f2f", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated control plane denial of service attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 istio/istio \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
