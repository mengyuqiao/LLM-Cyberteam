{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23604", "Description": "x26-Cogs is a repository of cogs made by Twentysix for the Red Discord bot. Among these cogs is the Defender cog, a tool for Discord server moderation. A vulnerability in the Defender cog prior to version 1.10.0 allows users with admin privileges to issue commands as other users who share the same server. If a bot owner shares the same server as the attacker, it is possible for the attacker to issue bot-owner restricted commands. The issue has been patched in version 1.10.0. One may unload the Defender cog as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23604", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nX26-cogs Project\u00bbX26-cogsVersions  before (<) 1.10.0cpe:2.3:a:x26-cogs_project:x26-cogs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-23  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-09-08  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-29  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/releases/tag/v1.10", "ref_desc": "Release v1.10 \u00b7 Twentysix26/x26-Cogs \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/commit/72dd9323cb4c90f3a5accac7087605375d178246", "ref_desc": "[Defender] WD: Ensure issuer of issue-command can view the channel \u00b7 Twentysix26/x26-Cogs@72dd932 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/security/advisories/GHSA-cfh8-v56j-5757", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation in Defender \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Twentysix26/x26-Cogs \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
