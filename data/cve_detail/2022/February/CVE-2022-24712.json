{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24712", "Description": "CodeIgniter4 is the 4.x branch of CodeIgniter, a PHP full-stack web framework. A vulnerability in versions prior to 4.1.9 might allow remote attackers to bypass the CodeIgniter4 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.9. There are workarounds for this vulnerability, but users will still need to code as these after upgrading to v4.1.9. Otherwise, the CSRF protection may be bypassed. If auto-routing is enabled, check the request method in the controller method before processing. If auto-routing is disabled, either avoid using `$routes->add()` and instead use HTTP verbs in routes; or check the request method in the controller method before processing.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24712", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCodeigniter\u00bbCodeigniterVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.1.9cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter:codeigniter:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-13  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 2  2024-02-13  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-21  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 4  2023-08-11  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/security/advisories/GHSA-4v37-24gm-h554", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection Bypass Vulnerability in CodeIgniter4 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4 \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/7dc2ece32401ebde67122f7d2460efcaee7c352e/user_guide_src/source/changelogs/v4.1.9.rst", "ref_desc": "CodeIgniter4/v4.1.9.rst at 7dc2ece32401ebde67122f7d2460efcaee7c352e \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
