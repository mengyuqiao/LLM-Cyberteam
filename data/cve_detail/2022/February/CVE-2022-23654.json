{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23654", "Description": "Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. In affected versions an authenticated user with write access on a restricted set of paths can update a page outside the allowed paths by specifying a different target page ID while keeping the path intact. The access control incorrectly check the path access against the user-provided values instead of the actual path associated to the page ID. Commit https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/411802ec2f654bb5ed1126c307575b81e2361c6b fixes this vulnerability by checking access control on the path associated with the page ID instead of the user-provided value. When the path is different than the current value, a second access control check is then performed on the user-provided path before the move operation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23654", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRequarks\u00bbWiki.jsVersions  before (<) 2.5.276cpe:2.3:a:requarks:wiki.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/411802ec2f654bb5ed1126c307575b81e2361c6b", "ref_desc": "fix: check update page access using original page path \u00b7 Requarks/wiki@411802e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-3cv9-795v-6j7j", "ref_desc": "Improper write access check using arbitrary page path \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
