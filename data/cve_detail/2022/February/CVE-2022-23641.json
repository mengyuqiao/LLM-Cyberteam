{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23641", "Description": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.8.1 in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 in the `tests-passed` branch, users can trigger a Denial of Service attack by posting a streaming URL. Parsing Oneboxes in the background job trigger an infinite loop, which cause memory leaks. This issue is patched in version 2.8.1 of the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 of the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, disable onebox in admin panel completely or specify allow list of domains that will be oneboxed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23641", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  before (<) 2.8.1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-07  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-09-23  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-08  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/15927", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Onebox response timeout and size limit by lis2 \u00b7 Pull Request #15927 \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/a34075d205a8857e29574ffd82aaece0c467565e", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Onebox response timeout and size limit (#15927) \u00b7 discourse/discourse@a34075d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-22xw-f62v-cfxv", "ref_desc": "Onebox susceptible to DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
