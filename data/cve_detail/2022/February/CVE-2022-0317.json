{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-0317", "Description": "An improper input validation vulnerability in go-attestation before 0.3.3 allows local users to provide a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs, causing AKPublic.Verify to succeed despite the inconsistency. Subsequent use of the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify lacks the authentication performed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker could couple this vulnerability with a maliciously-crafted TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof events in the TCG log, hence defeating remotely-attested measured-boot. We recommend upgrading to Version 0.4.0 or above.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0317", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbGo-attestationVersions  before (<) 0.3.3cpe:2.3:a:google:go-attestation:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/go-attestation/security/advisories/GHSA-99cg-575x-774p", "ref_desc": "Improper Input Validation in AKPublic.Verify with attacker-controlled TPM Quote \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 google/go-attestation \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
