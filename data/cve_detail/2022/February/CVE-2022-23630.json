{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23630", "Description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. In some cases, Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This occurs when dependency verification is disabled on one or more configurations and those configurations have common dependencies with other configurations that have dependency verification enabled. If the configuration that has dependency verification disabled is resolved first, Gradle does not verify the common dependencies for the configuration that has dependency verification enabled. Gradle 7.4 fixes that issue by validating artifacts at least once if they are present in a resolved configuration that has dependency verification active. For users who cannot update either do not use `ResolutionStrategy.disableDependencyVerification()` and do not use plugins that use that method to disable dependency verification for a single configuration or make sure resolution of configuration that disable that feature do not happen in builds that resolve configuration where the feature is enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23630", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nGradle\u00bbGradleVersions  from including (>=) 6.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.3.3cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.22%  -0.10 \n 2  2023-10-02  0.27%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-09-18  0.26%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-03  0.24%  0.26%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-24  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-9pf5-88jw-3qgr", "ref_desc": "Dependency verification can be bypassed when using `ResolutionStrategy.disableDependencyVerification()` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.gradle.org/7.4/release-notes.html", "ref_desc": "Gradle 7.4 Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commit/88ab9b652933bc3b2e3161b31ad8b8f4f0516351", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #19798 Do not share resolvable artifacts between v\u2026 \u00b7 gradle/gradle@88ab9b6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
