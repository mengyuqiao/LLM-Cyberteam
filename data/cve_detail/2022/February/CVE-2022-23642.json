{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23642", "Description": "Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph prior to version 3.37 is vulnerable to remote code execution in the `gitserver` service. The service acts as a git exec proxy, and fails to properly restrict calling `git config`. This allows an attacker to set the git `core.sshCommand` option, which sets git to use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on how Sourcegraph is deployed. An attacker able to make HTTP requests to internal services like gitserver is able to exploit it. This issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.37. As a workaround, ensure that requests to gitserver are properly protected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23642", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSourcegraph\u00bbSourcegraphVersions  before (<) 3.37cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:sourcegraph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.65% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  94.29%  96.65%  +2.37 \n 2  2024-12-14  94.06%  94.29%  +0.23 \n 3  2024-11-03  93.88%  94.06%  +0.18 \n 4  2024-10-21  93.56%  93.88%  +0.32 \n 5  2024-09-24  92.96%  93.56%  +0.59 \n 6  2024-08-16  91.76%  92.96%  +1.21 \n 7  2024-08-02  93.48%  91.76%  -1.72 \n 8  2024-06-21  93.83%  93.48%  -0.36 \n 9  2024-05-24  93.91%  93.83%  -0.08 \n 10  2024-04-27  93.82%  93.91%  +0.09 \n 11  2024-03-16  93.33%  93.82%  +0.49 \n 12  2024-03-03  94.20%  93.33%  -0.87 \n 13  2024-02-15  93.95%  94.20%  +0.25 \n 14  2024-02-03  94.62%  93.95%  -0.67 \n 15  2023-12-08  94.49%  94.62%  +0.13 \n 16  2023-11-23  94.43%  94.49%  +0.06 \n 17  2023-10-10  94.68%  94.43%  -0.26 \n 18  2023-09-26  94.35%  94.68%  +0.34 \n 19  2023-09-11  94.41%  94.35%  -0.06 \n 20  2023-08-29  94.24%  94.41%  +0.17 \n 21  2023-08-14  94.06%  94.24%  +0.18 \n 22  2023-05-13  94.12%  94.06%  -0.06 \n 23  2023-04-04  94.04%  94.12%  +0.08 \n 24  2023-03-23  93.49%  94.04%  +0.55 \n 25  2023-03-07  73.23%  93.49%  +20.26 \n 26  2023-01-09  71.61%  73.23%  +1.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-qcmp-fx72-q8q9", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution in gitserver \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167506/Sourcegraph-Gitserver-3.36.3-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Sourcegraph Gitserver 3.36.3 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167741/Sourcegraph-gitserver-sshCommand-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Sourcegraph gitserver sshCommand Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/30833", "ref_desc": "gitserver: Only allow acceptable commands and POST method in /exec by indradhanush \u00b7 Pull Request #30833 \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
