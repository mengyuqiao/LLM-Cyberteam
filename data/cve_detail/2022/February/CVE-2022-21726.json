{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21726", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `Dequantize` does not fully validate the value of `axis` and can result in heap OOB accesses. The `axis` argument can be `-1` (the default value for the optional argument) or any other positive value at most the number of dimensions of the input. Unfortunately, the upper bound is not checked and this results in reading past the end of the array containing the dimensions of the input tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21726", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.42%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-05-09  0.28%  0.29%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-27  0.22%  0.28%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-09-25  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-11  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-08-27  0.12%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-07-17  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-23hm-7w47-xw72", "ref_desc": "Heap OOB access in `Dequantize` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/dequantize_op.cc#L92-L153", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/dequantize_op.cc at 5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/23968a8bf65b009120c43b5ebcceaf52dbc9e943", "ref_desc": "Fix out of bound access in DequantizeOp by adding check for axis < in\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@23968a8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
