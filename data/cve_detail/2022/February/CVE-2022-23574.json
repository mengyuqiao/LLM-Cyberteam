{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23574", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. There is a typo in TensorFlow's `SpecializeType` which results in heap OOB read/write. Due to a typo, `arg` is initialized to the `i`th mutable argument in a loop where the loop index is `j`. Hence it is possible to assign to `arg` from outside the vector of arguments. Since this is a mutable proto value, it allows both read and write to outside of bounds data. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23574", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-10  0.28%  0.29%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.22%  0.28%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-12  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-08-28  0.12%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-07-18  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/full_type_util.cc#L81-L102", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/full_type_util.cc at a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-77gp-3h4r-6428", "ref_desc": "Heap OOB read/write in `SpecializeType` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0657c83d08845cc434175934c642299de2c0f042", "ref_desc": "Fix heap OOB read/write due to incorrect indexing. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@0657c83 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
