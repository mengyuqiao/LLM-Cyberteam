{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23646", "Description": "Next.js is a React framework. Starting with version 10.0.0 and prior to version 12.1.0, Next.js is vulnerable to User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information. In order to be affected, the `next.config.js` file must have an `images.domains` array assigned and the image host assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided SVG. If the `next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other than default, the instance is not affected. Version 12.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, change `next.config.js` to use a different `loader configuration` other than the default.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23646", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVercel\u00bbNext.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 12.1.0cpe:2.3:a:vercel:next.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-02  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-28  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-10  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-31  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-22  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-451 User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/451/User-Interface-UI-Misrepresentation-of-Critical-Informatio.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-fmvm-x8mv-47mj", "ref_desc": "Improper CSP in Image Optimization API for Next.js versions between 10.0.0 and 12.0.10 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release v12.1.0 \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/34075", "ref_desc": "Update to leverage response-cache for image-optimizer by ijjk \u00b7 Pull Request #34075 \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
