{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23612", "Description": "OpenMRS is a patient-based medical record system focusing on giving providers a free customizable electronic medical record system. Affected versions are subject to arbitrary file exfiltration due to failure to sanitize request when satisfying GET requests for `/images` & `/initfilter/scripts`. This can allow an attacker to access any file on a system running OpenMRS that is accessible to the user id OpenMRS is running under. Affected implementations should update to the latest patch version of OpenMRS Core for the minor version they use. These are: 2.1.5, 2.2.1, 2.3.5, 2.4.5 and 2.5.3. As a general rule, this vulnerability is already mitigated by Tomcat's URL normalization in Tomcat 7.0.28+. Users on older versions of Tomcat should consider upgrading their Tomcat instance as well as their OpenMRS instance.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23612", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nOpenmrs\u00bbOpenmrsVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.5cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:openmrs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenmrs\u00bbOpenmrsVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:openmrs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenmrs\u00bbOpenmrsVersions  from including (>=) 1.6andbefore (<) 2.1.5cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:openmrs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenmrs\u00bbOpenmrsVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.5cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:openmrs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenmrs\u00bbOpenmrsVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.3cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:openmrs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-07  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-28  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-16  0.10%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-15  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 6  2023-08-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-27  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/blob/ee3373a7a775bfdfa263e2e912c72e64342fb4f0/web/src/main/java/org/openmrs/web/filter/StartupFilter.java#L123", "ref_desc": "openmrs-core/StartupFilter.java at ee3373a7a775bfdfa263e2e912c72e64342fb4f0 \u00b7 openmrs/openmrs-core \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/security/advisories/GHSA-8rgr-ww69-jv65", "ref_desc": "Directory Traversal in OpenMRS Startup Filter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openmrs/openmrs-core \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lgtm.com/projects/g/openmrs/openmrs-core/snapshot/fb1335c925ca4c94be5a546707b90d2c1efa4dcc/files/web/src/main/java/org/openmrs/web/filter/StartupFilter.java#L123", "ref_desc": "LGTMPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/db8454bf19a092a78d53ee4dba2af628b730a6e7#diff-7c64d9f61d4d4e2ddba92920d7cf63ec96091b308d43904956b3846bc0c26d80R128", "ref_desc": "Fix bug \u00b7 openmrs/openmrs-core@db8454b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
