{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21741", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. ### Impact An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in the implementation of depthwise convolutions. The parameters of the convolution can be user controlled and are also used within a division operation to determine the size of the padding that needs to be added before applying the convolution. There is no check before this division that the divisor is strictly positive. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21741", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-27  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-09-25  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-11  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-369 Divide By Zero", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/369/Divide-By-Zero.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e5b0eec199c2d03de54fd6a7fd9275692218e2bc", "ref_desc": "[lite] Add validation check for dilation height/width to be positive \u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@e5b0eec \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depthwise_conv.cc#L96", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/depthwise_conv.cc at 5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-428x-9xc2-m8mj", "ref_desc": "FPE in depthwise convolutions in TFLite \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
