{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24707", "Description": "Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. UNION SQL injection and time-based blind injection vulnerabilities existed in Time Tracker Puncher plugin in versions of anuko timetracker prior to 1.20.0.5642. This was happening because the Puncher plugin was reusing code from other places and was relying on an unsanitized date parameter in POST requests. Because the parameter was not checked, it was possible to craft POST requests with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database. This issue has been resolved in in version 1.20.0.5642. Users unable to upgrade are advised to add their own checks to input.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24707", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nAnuko\u00bbTime TrackerVersions  before (<) 1.20.0.5642cpe:2.3:a:anuko:time_tracker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.74%  0.49%  -0.25 \n 2  2024-08-07  0.52%  0.74%  +0.22 \n 3  2024-03-21  0.37%  0.52%  +0.15 \n 4  2023-10-15  0.37%  0.37%  0.00 \n 5  2023-10-01  0.38%  0.37%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-09-16  0.29%  0.38%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-08-06  0.27%  0.29%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  7.17%  0.27%  -6.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167060/Anuko-Time-Tracker-1.20.0.5640-SQL-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Anuko Time Tracker 1.20.0.5640 SQL Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-wqx7-95fx-wjxj", "ref_desc": "UNION SQL injection and time-based blind in Puncher plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anuko/timetracker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/0e2d6563e2d969209c502a1eae4ddd8e87b73299", "ref_desc": "Addressed an sql injection vulnerability in puncher.php. \u00b7 anuko/timetracker@0e2d656 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
