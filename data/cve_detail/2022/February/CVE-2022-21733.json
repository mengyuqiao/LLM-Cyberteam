{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21733", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `StringNGrams` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by causing an out of memory condition after an integer overflow. We are missing a validation on `pad_witdh` and that result in computing a negative value for `ngram_width` which is later used to allocate parts of the output. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21733", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.12%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-04-27  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-09-25  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-11  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L29-L161", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/string_ngrams_op.cc at 5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f68fdab93fb7f4ddb4eb438c8fe052753c9413e8", "ref_desc": "Add a check for pad width to be a positive value. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@f68fdab \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-98j8-c9q4-r38g", "ref_desc": "OOM due to integer overflow in `StringNGrams` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
