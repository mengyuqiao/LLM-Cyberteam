{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23835", "Description": "The Visual Voice Mail (VVM) application through 2022-02-24 for Android allows persistent access if an attacker temporarily controls an application that has the READ_SMS permission, and reads an IMAP credentialing message that is (by design) not displayed to the victim within the AOSP SMS/MMS messaging application. (Often, the IMAP credentials are usable to listen to voice mail messages sent before the vulnerability was exploited, in addition to new ones.) NOTE: some vendors characterize this as not a \"concrete and exploitable risk.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23835", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVisual Voice Mail Project\u00bbVisual Voice Mail\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2022-02-24cpe:2.3:a:visual_voice_mail_project:visual_voice_mail:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.46%  +0.17 \n 2  2024-12-06  0.25%  0.30%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-11-10  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-10-01  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-17  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-07  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/383864", "ref_desc": "VU#383864 - Visual Voice Mail (VVM) services transmit unencrypted credentials via SMSThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gitlab.com/kop316/vvm-disclosure", "ref_desc": "Chris Talbot / vvm-disclosure \u00b7 GitLabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
