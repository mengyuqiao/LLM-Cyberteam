{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23655", "Description": "Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Affected versions of OctoberCMS did not validate gateway server signatures. As a result non-authoritative gateway servers may be used to exfiltrate user private keys. Users are advised to upgrade their installations to build 474 or v1.1.10. The only known workaround is to manually apply the patch (e3b455ad587282f0fbcb7763c6d9c3d000ca1e6a) which adds server signature validation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23655", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  before (<) 1.0.475cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 1.1.11cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-29  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-16  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-06  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-28  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/e3b455ad587282f0fbcb7763c6d9c3d000ca1e6a", "ref_desc": "Checks gateway server has a valid signature \u00b7 octobercms/october@e3b455a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-53m6-44rc-h2q5", "ref_desc": "Compromised gateway causes data breach \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
