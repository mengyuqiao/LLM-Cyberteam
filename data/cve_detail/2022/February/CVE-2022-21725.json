{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21725", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The estimator for the cost of some convolution operations can be made to execute a division by 0. The function fails to check that the stride argument is strictly positive. Hence, the fix is to add a check for the stride argument to ensure it is valid. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21725", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-27  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-09-25  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-11  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-369 Divide By Zero", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/369/Divide-By-Zero.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ffa202a17ab7a4a10182b746d230ea66f021fe16/tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/op_level_cost_estimator.cc#L189-L198", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/op_level_cost_estimator.cc at ffa202a17ab7a4a10182b746d230ea66f021fe16 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3218043d6d3a019756607643cf65574fbfef5d7a", "ref_desc": "Internal change \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@3218043 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-v3f7-j968-4h5f", "ref_desc": "Floating point division by 0 when executing convolution operators \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
