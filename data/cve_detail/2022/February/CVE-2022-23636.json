{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23636", "Description": "Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. Prior to versions 0.34.1 and 0.33.1, there exists a bug in the pooling instance allocator in Wasmtime's runtime where a failure to instantiate an instance for a module that defines an `externref` global will result in an invalid drop of a `VMExternRef` via an uninitialized pointer. A number of conditions listed in the GitHub Security Advisory must be true in order for an instance to be vulnerable to this issue. Maintainers believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because the usage of `externref` is still uncommon and without a resource limiter configured on the `Store`, which is not the default configuration, it is only possible to trigger the bug from an error returned by `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc`. Note that on Linux with the `uffd` feature enabled, it is only possible to trigger the bug from a resource limiter as the call to `mprotect` is skipped. The bug has been fixed in 0.34.1 and 0.33.1 and users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If it is not possible to upgrade to version 0.34.1 or 0.33.1 of the `wasmtime` crate, it is recommend that support for the reference types proposal be disabled by passing `false` to `Config::wasm_reference_types`. Doing so will prevent modules that use `externref` from being loaded entirely.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23636", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.33.1cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbVersion:0.34.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:0.34.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.22%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-11-01  0.21%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-09-09  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-30  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-21  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/824/Access-of-Uninitialized-Pointer.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/886ecc562040bef61faf19438c22285c2d62403a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-88xq-w8cq-xfg7 \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime@886ecc5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-88xq-w8cq-xfg7", "ref_desc": "Invalid drop of VMExternRef from partially-initialized instances in the pooling instance allocator \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
