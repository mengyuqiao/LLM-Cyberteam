{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23647", "Description": "Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Starting with version 1.14.0 and prior to version 1.27.0, Prism's command line plugin can be used by attackers to achieve a cross-site scripting attack. The command line plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text being inserted into the DOM as HTML code. Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the Command Line plugin are also not impacted. This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0. As a workaround, do not use the command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitize all code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use the command line plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23647", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPrismjs\u00bbPrism\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.27.0cpe:2.3:a:prismjs:prism:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-29  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-08-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-23  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/commit/e002e78c343154e1c0ddf9d6a0bb85689e1a5c7c", "ref_desc": "Command Line: Escape markup in command line output (#3341) \u00b7 PrismJS/prism@e002e78 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/3341", "ref_desc": "Command Line: Escape markup in command line output by at055612 \u00b7 Pull Request #3341 \u00b7 PrismJS/prism \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-3949-f494-cm99", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability in the Command line plugin in prismjs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrismJS/prism \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
