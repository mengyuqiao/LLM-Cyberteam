{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23633", "Description": "Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, and 5.2.6.1. Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this problem a middleware described in GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 can be used.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23633", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRubyonrails\u00bbRailsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRubyonrails\u00bbRailsVersions  from including (>=) 6.1.0andbefore (<) 6.1.4.6cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRubyonrails\u00bbRailsVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.2.2cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRubyonrails\u00bbRailsVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.0.4.6cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.20%  -0.08 \n 2  2024-10-27  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-01-24  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-04  0.20%  0.19%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-07-25  0.15%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-07-12  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-05-19  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-08  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/212/Improper-Removal-of-Sensitive-Information-Before-Storage-or-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240119-0013/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-23633 Ruby on Rails Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/11/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2022-23633] Possible exposure of information vulnerability in Action PackMailing List;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5372", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5372-1 railsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dKyFLWbq6Nbnn1IU8VxThdeH0F8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/f9a2ad03943d5c2ba54e1d45f155442b519c75da", "ref_desc": "Fix reloader to work with new Executor signature \u00b7 rails/rails@f9a2ad0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00002.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3093-1] rails security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hP10O7qgjnWGaG901sWosvjAzsA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9", "ref_desc": "Possible exposure of information vulnerability in Action Pack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rails/rails \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
