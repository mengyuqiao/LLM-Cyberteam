{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23853", "Description": "The LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugin in KDE Kate before 21.12.2 and KTextEditor before 5.91.0 tries to execute the associated LSP server binary when opening a file of a given type. If this binary is absent from the PATH, it will try running the LSP server binary in the directory of the file that was just opened (due to a misunderstanding of the QProcess API, that was never intended). This can be an untrusted directory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23853", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKDE\u00bbKtexteditorVersions  before (<) 5.91.0cpe:2.3:a:kde:ktexteditor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKDE\u00bbKateVersions  before (<) 21.12.2cpe:2.3:a:kde:kate:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-27  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-22  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-04  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-07-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://apps.kde.org/kate/", "ref_desc": "Kate - KDE ApplicationsProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kde.org/info/security/advisory-20220131-1.txt", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-21", "ref_desc": "KTextEditor: Arbitrary Local Code Execution (GLSA 202401-21) \u2014 Gentoo security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
