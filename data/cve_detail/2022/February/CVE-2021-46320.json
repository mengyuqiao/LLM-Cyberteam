{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-46320", "Description": "In OpenZeppelin <=v4.4.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-46320", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbOpenzeppelinVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.4.0cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:openzeppelin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-28  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-18  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-665 Improper Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/665/Improper-Initialization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-9c22-pwxw-p6hx", "ref_desc": "Initializer reentrancy may lead to double initialization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PGtStauOP7XnH5g5OaTtoUoughA.html"}]}
