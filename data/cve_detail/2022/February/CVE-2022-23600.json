{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23600", "Description": "fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23600", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFleetdm\u00bbFleetVersions  before (<) 4.9.1cpe:2.3:a:fleetdm:fleet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-18  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-ch68-7cf4-35vr", "ref_desc": "Limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fleetdm/fleet \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/commit/35d5a7b285f15ddd47486fa656e8b1acf3d48374", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-ch68-7cf4-35vr \u00b7 fleetdm/fleet@35d5a7b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
