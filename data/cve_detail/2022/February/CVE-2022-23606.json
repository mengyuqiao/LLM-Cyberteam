{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23606", "Description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23606", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.20.0andbefore (<) 1.20.2cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoy\u00bbVersion:1.21.0cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:1.21.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/4b6dd3b53cd5c6d4d4df378a2fc62c1707522b31", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-23606 \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy@4b6dd3b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-9vp2-4cp7-vvxf", "ref_desc": "Crash when a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
