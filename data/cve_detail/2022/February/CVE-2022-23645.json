{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23645", "Description": "swtpm is a libtpms-based TPM emulator with socket, character device, and Linux CUSE interface. Versions prior to 0.5.3, 0.6.2, and 0.7.1 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. A specially crafted header of swtpm's state, where the blobheader's hdrsize indicator has an invalid value, may cause an out-of-bounds access when the byte array representing the state of the TPM is accessed. This will likely crash swtpm or prevent it from starting since the state cannot be understood. Users should upgrade to swtpm v0.5.3, v0.6.2, or v0.7.1 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23645", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSwtpm Project\u00bbSwtpmVersions  before (<) 0.5.3cpe:2.3:a:swtpm_project:swtpm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSwtpm Project\u00bbSwtpmVersions  from including (>=) 0.6.0andbefore (<) 0.6.2cpe:2.3:a:swtpm_project:swtpm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSwtpm Project\u00bbSwtpm\u00bbVersion:0.7.0cpe:2.3:a:swtpm_project:swtpm:0.7.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSwtpm Project\u00bbSwtpm\u00bbVersion:0.7.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:swtpm_project:swtpm:0.7.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSwtpm Project\u00bbSwtpm\u00bbVersion:0.7.0UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:swtpm_project:swtpm:0.7.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm/releases/tag/v0.5.3", "ref_desc": "Release Release of v0.5.3 \u00b7 stefanberger/swtpm \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm/commit/9f740868fc36761de27df3935513bdebf8852d19", "ref_desc": "swtpm: Check header size indicator against expected size (CID 375869) \u00b7 stefanberger/swtpm@9f74086 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm/releases/tag/v0.6.2", "ref_desc": "Release Release of v0.6.2 \u00b7 stefanberger/swtpm \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm/releases/tag/v0.7.1", "ref_desc": "Release Release of v0.7.1 \u00b7 stefanberger/swtpm \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm/security/advisories/GHSA-2qgm-8xf4-3hqw", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read in swtpm when a specially crafted header of swtpm's state is given \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 stefanberger/swtpm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WL735FW266GO4C2JX4CJBOIOB7R7AY5A/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: swtpm-0.7.1-1.20220218git92a7035.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
