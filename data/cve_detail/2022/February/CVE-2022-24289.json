{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24289", "Description": "Hessian serialization is a network protocol that supports object-based transmission. Apache Cayenne's optional Remote Object Persistence (ROP) feature is a web services-based technology that provides object persistence and query functionality to 'remote' applications. In Apache Cayenne 4.1 and earlier, running on non-current patch versions of Java, an attacker with client access to Cayenne ROP can transmit a malicious payload to any vulnerable third-party dependency on the server. This can result in arbitrary code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24289", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCayenneVersions  before (<) 4.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:cayenne:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-01-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-04  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-07-25  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-16  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.07%  -1.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/11/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2022-24289: Apache Cayenne: Deserialization of untrusted data in the Hessian Component of Apache Cayenne 4.1 with older Java versionsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/zthjy83t3o66x7xcbygn2vg3yjvlc9vc", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-24289: Deserialization of untrusted data in the Hessian Component of Apache Cayenne 4.1 with older Java versions-Apache Mail ArchivesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
