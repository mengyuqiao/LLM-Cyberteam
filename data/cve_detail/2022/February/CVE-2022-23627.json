{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23627", "Description": "ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23627", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArchisteamfarm Project\u00bbArchisteamfarmVersions  from including (>=) 5.2.2.2andbefore (<) 5.2.2.5cpe:2.3:a:archisteamfarm_project:archisteamfarm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArchisteamfarm Project\u00bbArchisteamfarmVersions  from including (>=) 5.2.3.0andbefore (<) 5.2.3.2cpe:2.3:a:archisteamfarm_project:archisteamfarm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-09-01  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 3  2023-05-16  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.10%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/commit/7a29d9282bdc3280db2a379c24f73916d786f9b4", "ref_desc": "Fix permissions when proxifying commands \u00b7 JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm@7a29d92 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/commit/f807bdb660e75dee5a34994f2ea70970ca6d0492", "ref_desc": "Fix permissions when proxifying commands (#2509) \u00b7 JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm@f807bdb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/5.2.3.2", "ref_desc": "Release ArchiSteamFarm V5.2.3.2 \u00b7 JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/tag/5.2.2.5", "ref_desc": "Release ArchiSteamFarm V5.2.2.5 \u00b7 JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/pull/2509", "ref_desc": "Fix permissions when proxifying commands by JustArchi \u00b7 Pull Request #2509 \u00b7 JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/pull/2501", "ref_desc": "Closes #2500 by JustArchi \u00b7 Pull Request #2501 \u00b7 JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/security/advisories/GHSA-88ch-366c-5m89", "ref_desc": "Inadequate access verification when using proxy commands (< 5.2.2.5, < 5.2.3.2) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
