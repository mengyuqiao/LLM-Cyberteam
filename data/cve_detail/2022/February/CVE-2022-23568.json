{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23568", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `AddManySparseToTensorsMap` is vulnerable to an integer overflow which results in a `CHECK`-fail when building new `TensorShape` objects (so, an assert failure based denial of service). We are missing some validation on the shapes of the input tensors as well as directly constructing a large `TensorShape` with user-provided dimensions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23568", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.17%  -0.14 \n 2  2024-10-06  0.22%  0.31%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-04-27  0.17%  0.22%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-09-25  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-11  0.12%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-08-27  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a68f68061e263a88321c104a6c911fe5598050a8", "ref_desc": "Replace faulty overflow check with a builder for `TensorShape`. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@a68f680 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-6445-fm66-fvq2", "ref_desc": "Integer overflows in `AddManySparseToTensorsMap` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b51b82fe65ebace4475e3c54eb089c18a4403f1c", "ref_desc": "Add missing validation to `AddManySparseToTensorsMap`. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@b51b82f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_tensors_map_ops.cc", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/sparse_tensors_map_ops.cc at 5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
