{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23650", "Description": "Netmaker is a platform for creating and managing virtual overlay networks using WireGuard. Prior to versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, and 010.0, there is a hard-coded cryptographic key in the code base which can be exploited to run admin commands on a remote server if the exploiter know the address and username of the admin. This effects the server (netmaker) component, and not clients. This has been patched in Netmaker v0.8.5, v0.9.4, and v0.10.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23650", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGravitl\u00bbNetmakerVersions  before (<) 0.8.5cpe:2.3:a:gravitl:netmaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGravitl\u00bbNetmakerVersions  from including (>=) 0.9.0andbefore (<) 0.9.4cpe:2.3:a:gravitl:netmaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.12%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-10-10  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-11  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/commit/3d4f44ecfe8be4ca38920556ba3b90502ffb4fee", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #770 from gravitl/hotfix_v0.10.0_jwt_data \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker@3d4f44e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/commit/e9bce264719f88c30e252ecc754d08f422f4c080", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #777 from gravitl/hotfix_v0.9.4 \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker@e9bce26 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/security/advisories/GHSA-86f3-hf24-76q4", "ref_desc": "Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/pull/781/commits/1bec97c662670dfdab804343fc42ae4b1d050a87", "ref_desc": "hotfix v0.8.5 by 0xdcarns \u00b7 Pull Request #781 \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
