{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24112", "Description": "An attacker can abuse the batch-requests plugin to send requests to bypass the IP restriction of Admin API. A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote code execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port different from the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug in the code, this check can be bypassed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24112", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbApisixVersions  from including (>=) 2.11.0andbefore (<) 2.12.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:apisix:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbApisixVersions  before (<) 2.10.4cpe:2.3:a:apache:apisix:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.38%  97.20%  -0.18 \n 2  2024-10-27  97.40%  97.38%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-09-17  97.41%  97.40%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-04-20  97.42%  97.41%  0.00 \n 5  2024-04-06  97.42%  97.42%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-03-23  97.42%  97.42%  0.00 \n 7  2024-02-25  97.44%  97.42%  -0.02 \n 8  2024-02-08  97.44%  97.44%  +0.00 \n 9  2024-02-07  97.26%  97.44%  +0.18 \n 10  2024-01-27  97.28%  97.26%  -0.02 \n 11  2024-01-11  97.26%  97.28%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-12-29  97.20%  97.26%  +0.06 \n 13  2023-12-01  97.24%  97.20%  -0.05 \n 14  2023-11-16  97.22%  97.24%  +0.02 \n 15  2023-11-01  97.22%  97.22%  +0.00 \n 16  2023-10-17  97.26%  97.22%  -0.04 \n 17  2023-10-03  97.16%  97.26%  +0.10 \n 18  2023-09-22  97.37%  97.16%  -0.21 \n 19  2023-09-19  97.38%  97.37%  -0.01 \n 20  2023-09-04  97.34%  97.38%  +0.04 \n 21  2023-08-22  97.36%  97.34%  -0.02 \n 22  2023-08-07  97.30%  97.36%  +0.06 \n 23  2023-07-25  97.23%  97.30%  +0.08 \n 24  2023-07-12  97.23%  97.23%  0.00 \n 25  2023-06-28  97.04%  97.23%  +0.19 \n 26  2023-06-15  96.92%  97.04%  +0.12 \n 27  2023-05-19  97.12%  96.92%  -0.20 \n 28  2023-05-06  97.15%  97.12%  -0.03 \n 29  2023-04-23  97.26%  97.15%  -0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/lcdqywz8zy94mdysk7p3gfdgn51jmt94", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-24112: Apache APISIX: apisix/batch-requests plugin allows overwriting the X-REAL-IP header-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166328/Apache-APISIX-2.12.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache APISIX 2.12.1 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/11/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2022-24112: Apache APISIX: apisix/batch-requests plugin allows overwriting the X-REAL-IP headerMailing List;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166228/Apache-APISIX-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache APISIX Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Q2vHW-RcsQFLntMHn_YFIF7pNr4.html"}]}
