{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20653", "Description": "A vulnerability in the DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) email verification component of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling in DNS name resolution by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially formatted email messages that are processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to become unreachable from management interfaces or to process additional email messages for a period of time until the device recovers, resulting in a DoS condition. Continued attacks could cause the device to become completely unavailable, resulting in a persistent DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20653", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 13.5.0andbefore (<) 13.5.4.102cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  before (<) 13.0.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.0.2.020cpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-02  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-10  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-31  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-dos-MxZvGtgU", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance DNS Verification Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
