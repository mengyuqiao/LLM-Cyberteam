{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23652", "Description": "capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for Capsule Operator which provides multi-tenancy in Kubernetes. In versions prior to 0.2.1 an attacker with a proper authentication mechanism may use a malicious `Connection` header to start a privilege escalation attack towards the Kubernetes API Server. This vulnerability allows for an exploit of the `cluster-admin` Role bound to `capsule-proxy`. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23652", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nClastix\u00bbCapsule-proxyVersions  before (<) 0.2.1cpe:2.3:a:clastix:capsule-proxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.42%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-05-16  0.22%  0.29%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-10-15  0.19%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-10-01  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-15  0.13%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/clastix/capsule-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-9cwv-cppx-mqjm", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation using hop-by-hop Connection header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 clastix/capsule-proxy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/clastix/capsule-proxy/issues/188", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation vulnerability via malicious \"Connection\" header \u00b7 Issue #188 \u00b7 clastix/capsule-proxy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/clastix/capsule-proxy/commit/efe91f68ebf8a9e3d21491dc57da7b8a746415d8", "ref_desc": "bug: cve exploiting malicious connection header \u00b7 clastix/capsule-proxy@efe91f6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
