{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23643", "Description": "Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph versions 3.35 and 3.36 reintroduced a previously fixed side-channel vulnerabilitity in the Code Monitoring feature where strings in private source code could be guessed by an authenticated but unauthorized actor. This issue affects only the Code Monitoring feature, whereas CVE-2021-43823 also affected saved searches. A successful attack would require an authenticated bad actor to create many Code Monitors to receive confirmation that a specific string exists. This could allow an attacker to guess formatted tokens in source code, such as API keys. This issue was patched in versions 3.35.2 and 3.36.3 of Sourcegraph. Those who are unable to upgrade may disable the Code Monitor feature in their installation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23643", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSourcegraph\u00bbSourcegraphVersions  from including (>=) 3.36.0andbefore (<) 3.36.3cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:sourcegraph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSourcegraph\u00bbSourcegraphVersions  from including (>=) 3.35.0andbefore (<) 3.35.2cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:sourcegraph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-08  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-29  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/30547", "ref_desc": "set the actor for code monitor searches to monitor owner by camdencheek \u00b7 Pull Request #30547 \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-xqv2-x6f2-w3pf", "ref_desc": "Side-channel attack in Sourcegraph Code Monitors \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
