{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21705", "Description": "Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21705", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  before (<) 1.0.474cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 1.1.10cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.1.27cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.52%  0.36%  -0.16 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.47%  0.52%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-09-16  0.47%  0.47%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-03  0.52%  0.47%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-08-19  0.47%  0.52%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-08-06  0.52%  0.47%  -0.04 \n 7  2023-07-24  0.41%  0.52%  +0.11 \n 8  2023-05-18  0.36%  0.41%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-04-09  0.25%  0.36%  +0.11 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.25%  -1.19 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe", "ref_desc": "Backport fix from 2.0 \u00b7 octobercms/library@c393c5c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-79jw-2f46-wv22", "ref_desc": "Authenticated remote code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
