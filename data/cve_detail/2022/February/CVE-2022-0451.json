{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-0451", "Description": "Dart SDK contains the HTTPClient in dart:io library whcih includes authorization headers when handling cross origin redirects. These headers may be explicitly set and contain sensitive information. By default, HttpClient handles redirection logic. If a request is sent to example.com with authorization header and it redirects to an attackers site, they might not expect attacker site to receive authorization header. We recommend updating the Dart SDK to version 2.16.0 or beyond.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0451", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDart\u00bbDart Software Development KitVersions  before (<) 2.16.0cpe:2.3:a:dart:dart_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-01  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-305 Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/305/Authentication-Bypass-by-Primary-Weakness.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/57db739be0ad4629079bfa94840064f615d35abc", "ref_desc": "Disable security-related headers on redirect. \u00b7 dart-lang/sdk@57db739 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://dart-review.googlesource.com/c/sdk/+/229947", "ref_desc": "Disable security-related headers on redirect.
