{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23590", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A `GraphDef` from a TensorFlow `SavedModel` can be maliciously altered to cause a TensorFlow process to crash due to encountering a `StatusOr` value that is an error and forcibly extracting the value from it. We have patched the issue in multiple GitHub commits and these will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0 and TensorFlow 2.7.1, as both are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23590", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.7.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.17%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.17%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-12  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-28  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-09  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/955059813cc325dc1db5e2daa6221271406d4439", "ref_desc": "Check for type inference error on node construction. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@9550598 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-pqrv-8r2f-7278", "ref_desc": "Crash due to erroneous `StatusOr` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/core/graph/graph.cc#L560-L567", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/graph.cc at 274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
