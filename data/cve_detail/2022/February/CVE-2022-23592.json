{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23592", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow's type inference can cause a heap out of bounds read as the bounds checking is done in a `DCHECK` (which is a no-op during production). An attacker can control the `input_idx` variable such that `ix` would be larger than the number of values in `node_t.args`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23592", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andbefore (<) 2.8.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-10  0.28%  0.29%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.22%  0.28%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-12  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-08-28  0.12%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-07-18  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/core/graph/graph.cc#L223-L229", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/graph.cc at 274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-vq36-27g6-p492", "ref_desc": "Heap OOB access in `RunForwardTypeInference` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c99d98cd189839dcf51aee94e7437b54b31f8abd", "ref_desc": "Handle invalid inputs instead of crashing. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@c99d98c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
