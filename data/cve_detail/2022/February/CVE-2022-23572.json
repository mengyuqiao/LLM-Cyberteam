{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23572", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during shape inference. This case is covered by the `DCHECK` function however, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23572", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-10-25  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-26  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-09-12  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.08%  -2.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b", "ref_desc": "Properly handle the case where `SpecializeType()` returns an error `S\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@cb16478 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.cc#L168-L174", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/shape_inference.cc at a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-rww7-2gpw-fv6j", "ref_desc": "Crash when type cannot be specialized \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
