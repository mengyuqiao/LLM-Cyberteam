{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23589", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, Grappler component of TensorFlow can trigger a null pointer dereference. There are 2 places where this can occur, for the same malicious alteration of a `SavedModel` file (fixing the first one would trigger the same dereference in the second place). First, during constant folding, the `GraphDef` might not have the required nodes for the binary operation. If a node is missing, the correposning `mul_*child` would be null, and the dereference in the subsequent line would be incorrect. We have a similar issue during `IsIdentityConsumingSwitch`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23589", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.37%  0.40%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.26%  0.37%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.20%  0.26%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-12  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-08-28  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-05-12  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/grappler/mutable_graph_view.cc#L59-L74", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/mutable_graph_view.cc at a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9px9-73fg-3fqp", "ref_desc": "Null pointer dereference in Grappler's `IsConstant` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/045deec1cbdebb27d817008ad5df94d96a08b1bf", "ref_desc": "Prevent null pointer dereference in `mutable_graph_view` \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@045deec \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/constant_folding.cc#L3466-L3497", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/constant_folding.cc at a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0a365c029e437be0349c31f8d4c9926b69fa3fa1", "ref_desc": "Prevent null pointer dereference in constant folding. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@0a365c0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
