{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23591", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23591", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-28  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-09  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.08%  -1.36 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/448a16182065bd08a202d9057dd8ca541e67996c", "ref_desc": "Prevent stack overflow when FunctionLib in GraphDef has a self-recurs\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@448a161 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-247x-2f9f-5wp7", "ref_desc": "Stack overflow due to self-recursive function in `GraphDef` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
