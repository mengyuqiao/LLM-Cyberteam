{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20750", "Description": "A vulnerability in the checkpoint manager implementation of Cisco Redundancy Configuration Manager (RCM) for Cisco StarOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the checkpoint manager process to restart upon receipt of malformed TCP data. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of an ingress TCP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP data to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the checkpoint manager process restarting.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20750", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRedundancy Configuration Manager\u00bbForStarosVersions  before (<) 21.24.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:redundancy_configuration_manager:*:*:*:*:*:staros:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-02  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-10  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-31  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rcm-tcp-dos-2Wh8XjAQ", "ref_desc": "Cisco Redundancy Configuration Manager for Cisco StarOS Software TCP Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
