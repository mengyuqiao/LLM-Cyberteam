{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-0377", "Description": "Users of the LearnPress WordPress plugin before 4.1.5 can upload an image as a profile avatar after the registration.  After this process the user crops and saves the image. Then a \"POST\" request that contains user supplied name of the image is sent to the server for renaming and cropping of the image. As a result of this request, the name of the user-supplied image is changed with a MD5 value. This process can be conducted only when type of the image is JPG or PNG. An attacker can use this vulnerability in order to rename an arbitrary image file. By doing this, they could destroy the design of the web site.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0377", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nThimpress\u00bbLearnpress\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 4.1.5cpe:2.3:a:thimpress:learnpress:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.70%  0.30%  -0.40 \n 2  2024-06-19  0.61%  0.70%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-05-22  0.47%  0.61%  +0.14 \n 4  2024-03-26  0.33%  0.47%  +0.14 \n 5  2023-12-18  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-09-21  0.26%  0.30%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-09-08  0.21%  0.26%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-07-22  0.30%  0.21%  -0.09 \n 9  2023-03-07  7.31%  0.30%  -7.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/73/External-Control-of-File-Name-or-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/0d95ada6-53e3-4a80-a395-eacd7b090f26", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LearnPress/learnpress/commit/d1dc4af7ef2950f1000abc21bd9520fb3eb98faf", "ref_desc": "= 4.1.4.2 = \u00b7 LearnPress/learnpress@d1dc4af \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bozogullarindan.com/en/2022/01/wordpress-learnpress-plugin-4.1.4.1-arbitrary-image-renaming/", "ref_desc": "Wordpress Learnpress Plugin <= 4.1.4.1 - Arbitrary Image Renaming | Ceylan Bozogullarindan's WebpageExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
