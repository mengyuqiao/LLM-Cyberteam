{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24975", "Description": "The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the availability of deleted content, aka the \"GitBleed\" issue. This could present a security risk if information-disclosure auditing processes rely on a clone operation without the --mirror option. Note: This has been disputed by multiple 3rd parties who believe this is an intended feature of the git binary and does not pose a security risk.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24975", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGit-scm\u00bbGITVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.35.1cpe:2.3:a:git-scm:git:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-27  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-08-02  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-07-03  0.22%  0.17%  -0.06 \n 6  2023-09-04  0.20%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-07-25  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-16  0.16%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.aquasec.com/blog/undetected-hard-code-secrets-expose-corporations/", "ref_desc": "Phantom Secrets: Undetected Secrets Expose Major Corporations", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git/git/blob/2dc94da3744bfbbf145eca587a0f5ff480cc5867/Documentation/git-clone.txt#L185-L191", "ref_desc": "git/git-clone.txt at 2dc94da3744bfbbf145eca587a0f5ff480cc5867 \u00b7 git/git \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/11/gitbleed/", "ref_desc": "GitBleed \u2013 Finding Secrets in Mirrored Git Repositories | Nightwatch CybersecurityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4k14qe9g.fsf%40gitster.g/", "ref_desc": "Re: CVE-2022-24975 - Junio C Hamano", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
