{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23602", "Description": "Nimforum is a lightweight alternative to Discourse written in Nim. In versions prior to 2.2.0 any forum user can create a new thread/post with an include referencing a file local to the host operating system. Nimforum will render the file if able. This can also be done silently by using NimForum's post \"preview\" endpoint. Even if NimForum is running as a non-critical user, the forum.json secrets can be stolen. Version 2.2.0 of NimForum includes patches for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as is possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23602", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nNim-lang\u00bbDocutils\u00bbForNIMVersions  before (<) 1.6.2cpe:2.3:a:nim-lang:docutils:*:*:*:*:*:nim:*:*Matching versions\nNim-lang\u00bbNimforum\u00bbForNIMVersions  before (<) 2.2.0cpe:2.3:a:nim-lang:nimforum:*:*:*:*:*:nim:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-17  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-09-23  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-08-25  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-07-15  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-07-14  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nim-lang/nimforum/security/advisories/GHSA-q3vh-x957-wr75", "ref_desc": "Nim's rst parser sandboxed mode allows include which can embed any local file \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nim-lang/nimforum \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/commit/cb894c7094fb49014f85815a9dafc38b5dda743e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-ggrq-h43f-3w7m \u00b7 nim-lang/Nim@cb894c7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
