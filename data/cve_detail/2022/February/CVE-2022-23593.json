{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23593", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `simplifyBroadcast` function in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a segfault (hence, denial of service), if called with scalar shapes. If all shapes are scalar, then `maxRank` is 0, so we build an empty `SmallVector`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23593", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andbefore (<) 2.8.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.16%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.17%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-12  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-28  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-09  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-gwcx-jrx4-92w2", "ref_desc": "Segfault in `simplifyBroadcast` (MLIR) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/35f0fabb4c178253a964d7aabdbb15c6a398b69a", "ref_desc": "Avoid Segfault for scalar shapes. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@35f0fab \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/tfrt/jit/transforms/tf_cpurt_symbolic_shape_optimization.cc#L149-L205", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/tf_cpurt_symbolic_shape_optimization.cc at 274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
