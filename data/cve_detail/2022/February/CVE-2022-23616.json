{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23616", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions it's possible for an unprivileged user to perform a remote code execution by injecting a groovy script in her own profile and by calling the Reset password feature since the feature is performing a save of the user profile with programming rights in the impacted versions of XWiki. The issue has been patched in XWiki 13.1RC1. There are two different possible workarounds, each consisting of modifying the XWiki/ResetPassword page. 1. The Reset password feature can be entirely disabled by deleting the XWiki/ResetPassword page. 2. The script in XWiki/ResetPassword can also be modified or removed: an administrator can replace it with a simple email contact to ask an administrator to reset the password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23616", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.1andup to, including, (<=) 13.1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:3.1UpdateMilestone1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:3.1:milestone1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:3.1UpdateMilestone2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:3.1:milestone2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:3.1UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:3.1:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.60%  0.48%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-07-24  0.58%  0.60%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-03  0.50%  0.58%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-01-25  0.34%  0.50%  +0.16 \n 5  2023-09-17  0.33%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-09-02  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-14  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.27%  -1.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-16661", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-16661] RCE using reset password - XWiki.org JIRAPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-mgjw-2wrp-r535", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution in user profiles with reset password \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
