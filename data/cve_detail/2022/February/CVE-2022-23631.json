{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23631", "Description": "superjson is a program to allow JavaScript expressions to be serialized to a superset of JSON. In versions prior to 1.8.1 superjson allows input to run arbitrary code on any server using superjson input without prior authentication or knowledge. The only requirement is that the server implements at least one endpoint which uses superjson during request processing. This has been patched in superjson 1.8.1. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23631", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBlitzjs\u00bbSuperjson\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.8.1cpe:2.3:a:blitzjs:superjson:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nBlitzjs\u00bbBlitz\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.45.3cpe:2.3:a:blitzjs:blitz:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.46%  0.61%  +0.16 \n 2  2024-10-25  0.57%  0.46%  -0.11 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.46%  0.57%  +0.11 \n 4  2024-08-20  0.48%  0.46%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-05-03  0.37%  0.48%  +0.11 \n 6  2024-01-09  0.48%  0.37%  -0.11 \n 7  2023-11-01  0.18%  0.48%  +0.30 \n 8  2023-09-02  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-07-23  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-05-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-03-14  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/blitzjs-prototype-pollution/", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via Prototype Pollution in Blitz.js | SonarExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5888-ffcr-r425", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution in superjson \u00b7 CVE-2022-23631 \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson/security/advisories/GHSA-5888-ffcr-r425", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 blitz-js/superjson \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
