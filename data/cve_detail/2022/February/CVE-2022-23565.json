{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23565", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can trigger denial of service via assertion failure by altering a `SavedModel` on disk such that `AttrDef`s of some operation are duplicated. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
