{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21687", "Description": "gh-ost is a triggerless online schema migration solution for MySQL. Versions prior to 1.1.3 are subject to an arbitrary file read vulnerability. The attacker must have access to the target host or trick an administrator into executing a malicious gh-ost command on a host running gh-ost, plus network access from host running gh-ost to the attack's malicious MySQL server. The `-database` parameter does not properly sanitize user input which can lead to arbitrary file reads.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21687", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbGh-ostVersions  before (<) 1.1.3cpe:2.3:a:github:gh-ost:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-10-17  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-09-07  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-25  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-15  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/gh-ost/commit/a91ab042de013cfd8fbb633763438932d9080d8f", "ref_desc": "Security: fix vulnerability where `-database` parameter accepts arbit\u2026 \u00b7 github/gh-ost@a91ab04 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/gh-ost/security/advisories/GHSA-rrp4-2xx3-mv29", "ref_desc": "Improper Input Validation of `-database` Parameter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 github/gh-ost \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
