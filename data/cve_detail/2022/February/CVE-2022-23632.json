{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23632", "Description": "Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.6.1, Traefik skips the router transport layer security (TLS) configuration when the host header is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For a request, the TLS configuration choice can be different than the router choice, which implies the use of a wrong TLS configuration. When sending a request using FQDN handled by a router configured with a dedicated TLS configuration, the TLS configuration falls back to the default configuration that might not correspond to the configured one. If the CNAME flattening is enabled, the selected TLS configuration is the SNI one and the routing uses the CNAME value, so this can skip the expected TLS configuration. Version 2.6.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may add the FDQN to the host rule. However, there is no workaround if the CNAME flattening is enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23632", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOracle\u00bbCommunications Unified Inventory Management\u00bbVersion:7.5.0cpe:2.3:a:oracle:communications_unified_inventory_management:7.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTraefik\u00bbTraefikVersions  before (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:traefik:traefik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-02  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-28  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-10  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 5  2023-07-31  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/8764", "ref_desc": "Apply the same approach as the rules system on the TLS configuration choice by ldez \u00b7 Pull Request #8764 \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.6.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.6.1 \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/security/advisories/GHSA-hrhx-6h34-j5hc", "ref_desc": "Wrong TLS configuration choice \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/z0T4vZZMJxuRWtccNkz5b23_D-0.html"}]}
