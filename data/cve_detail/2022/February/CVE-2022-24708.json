{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24708", "Description": "Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. ttUser.class.php in Time Tracker versions prior to 1.20.0.5646 was not escaping primary group name for display. Because of that, it was possible for a logged in user to modify primary group name with elements of JavaScript. Such script could then be executed in user browser on subsequent requests on pages where primary group name was displayed. This is vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.20.0.5646. Users who are unable to upgrade may modify ttUser.class.php to use an additional call to htmlspecialchars when printing group name.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24708", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nAnuko\u00bbTime TrackerVersions  before (<) 1.20.0.5646cpe:2.3:a:anuko:time_tracker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-16  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-rgcm-xgvj-5mqh", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS vulnerability in primary group name \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anuko/timetracker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/6aaad31630500d13b6c8459daa9f406fd5eb4330", "ref_desc": "Addressed stored XSS vulnerability when displaying primary group name. \u00b7 anuko/timetracker@6aaad31 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
