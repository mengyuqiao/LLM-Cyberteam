{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23651", "Description": "b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23651", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBackblaze\u00bbB2 Python Software Development Kit\u00bbForMACVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.14.0cpe:2.3:a:backblaze:b2_python_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:mac:*:*Matching versions\nBackblaze\u00bbB2 Python Software Development Kit\u00bbForLinuxVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.14.0cpe:2.3:a:backblaze:b2_python_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:linux:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Backblaze/b2-sdk-python/security/advisories/GHSA-p867-fxfr-ph2w", "ref_desc": "b2-sdk-python TOCTOU application key disclosure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Backblaze/b2-sdk-python \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/b2sdk/", "ref_desc": "b2sdk \u00b7 PyPIProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Backblaze/b2-sdk-python/commit/62476638986e5b6d7459aca5ef8ce220760226e0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-p867-fxfr-ph2w \u00b7 Backblaze/b2-sdk-python@6247663 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
