{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23587", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain scenarios, Grappler component of TensorFlow is vulnerable to an integer overflow during cost estimation for crop and resize. Since the cropping parameters are user controlled, a malicious person can trigger undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23587", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.27%  -0.09 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.37%  0.36%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-09-10  0.30%  0.37%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-04-28  0.24%  0.30%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-09-26  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-09-12  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-08-28  0.12%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-07-18  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 9  2023-03-09  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/op_level_cost_estimator.cc#L2621-L2689", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/op_level_cost_estimator.cc at a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-8jj7-5vxc-pg2q", "ref_desc": "Integer overflow in Grappler cost estimation of crop and resize operation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0aaaae6eca5a7175a193696383f582f53adab23f", "ref_desc": "Prevent overflow in grappler cost estimation of crop&resize op. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@0aaaae6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
