{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23607", "Description": "treq is an HTTP library inspired by requests but written on top of Twisted's Agents. Treq's request methods (`treq.get`, `treq.post`, etc.) and `treq.client.HTTPClient` constructor accept cookies as a dictionary. Such cookies are not bound to a single domain, and are therefore sent to *every* domain (\"supercookies\"). This can potentially cause sensitive information to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain., e.g. should `https://example.com` redirect to `http://cloudstorageprovider.com` the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind cookies given to request methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`, `HTTPClient.request`, `HTTPClient.get`, etc.) to the origin of the *url* parameter. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade Instead of passing a dictionary as the *cookies* argument, pass a `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance with properly domain- and scheme-scoped cookies in it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23607", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTwistedmatrix\u00bbTreqVersions  from including (>=) 21.1.0andbefore (<) 22.1.0cpe:2.3:a:twistedmatrix:treq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-07  0.23%  0.23%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-25  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-15  0.21%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/425/Direct-Request-Forced-Browsing-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00025.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2954-1] python-treq security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/twisted/treq/security/advisories/GHSA-fhpf-pp6p-55qc", "ref_desc": "Unsafe handling of user-specified cookies in treq \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 twisted/treq \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
