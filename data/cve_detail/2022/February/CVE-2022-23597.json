{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23597", "Description": "Element Desktop is a Matrix client for desktop platforms with Element Web at its core. Element Desktop before 1.9.7 is vulnerable to a remote program execution bug with user interaction. The exploit is non-trivial and requires clicking on a malicious link, followed by another button click. To the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability has never been exploited in the wild. If you are using Element Desktop < 1.9.7, we recommend upgrading at your earliest convenience. If successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a file path of a binary on the victim's computer which then gets executed. Notably, the attacker does *not* have the ability to specify program arguments. However, in certain unspecified configurations, the attacker may be able to specify an URI instead of a file path which then gets handled using standard platform mechanisms. These may allow exploiting further vulnerabilities in those mechanisms, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23597", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElement\u00bbDesktop\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.9.7cpe:2.3:a:element:desktop:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.30%  0.33%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-07  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-25  0.32%  0.29%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-07-15  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.28%  0.28%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.28%  -1.16 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/security/advisories/GHSA-mjrg-9f8r-h3m7", "ref_desc": "Remote program execution with user interaction \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vector-im/element-desktop \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/commit/89b1e39b801655e595337708d4319ba4313feafa", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-mjrg-9f8r-h3m7 \u00b7 vector-im/element-desktop@89b1e39 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
