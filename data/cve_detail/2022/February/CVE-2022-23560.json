{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23560", "Description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would allow limited reads and writes outside of arrays in TFLite. This exploits missing validation in the conversion from sparse tensors to dense tensors. The fix is included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23560", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-10  0.28%  0.29%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.22%  0.28%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-12  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-08-28  0.12%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-07-18  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ca6f96b62ad84207fbec580404eaa7dd7403a550/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/utils/sparsity_format_converter.cc#L252-L293", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/sparsity_format_converter.cc at ca6f96b62ad84207fbec580404eaa7dd7403a550 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6364463d6f5b6254cac3d6aedf999b6a96225038", "ref_desc": "[lite] Add some safety checks to avoid out of bound access for sparsi\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@6364463 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-4hvf-hxvg-f67v", "ref_desc": "Read and Write outside of bounds in TFLite \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
