{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-25328", "Description": "The bash_completion script for fscrypt allows injection of commands via crafted mountpoint paths, allowing privilege escalation under a specific set of circumstances. A local user who has control over mountpoint paths could potentially escalate their privileges if they create a malicious mountpoint path and if the system administrator happens to be using the fscrypt bash completion script to complete mountpoint paths. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25328", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbFscryptVersions  before (<) 0.3.3cpe:2.3:a:google:fscrypt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/fscrypt/pull/346", "ref_desc": "Metadata validation and other security improvements by ebiggers \u00b7 Pull Request #346 \u00b7 google/fscrypt \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_oQBHv2h6Noj3Sd6n5XQh-8D4_Y.html"}]}
