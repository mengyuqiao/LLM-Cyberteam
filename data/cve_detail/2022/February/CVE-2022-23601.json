{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23601", "Description": "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. The Symfony form component provides a CSRF protection mechanism by using a random token injected in the form and using the session to store and control the token submitted by the user. When using the FrameworkBundle, this protection can be enabled or disabled with the configuration. If the configuration is not specified, by default, the mechanism is enabled as long as the session is enabled. In a recent change in the way the configuration is loaded, the default behavior has been dropped and, as a result, the CSRF protection is not enabled in form when not explicitly enabled, which makes the application sensible to CSRF attacks. This issue has been resolved in the patch versions listed and users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23601", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 5.4.0andbefore (<) 5.4.4cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  before (<) 5.3.15cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.0.4cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2023-08-25  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-15  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/f0ffb775febdf07e57117aabadac96fa37857f50", "ref_desc": "Enable CSRF in FORM by default \u00b7 symfony/symfony@f0ffb77 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-vvmr-8829-6whx", "ref_desc": "CSRF token missing in forms \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
