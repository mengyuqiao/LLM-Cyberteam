{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23639", "Description": "crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scoped threads, and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust. crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that the alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. However, the alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race. Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected by this issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23639", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCrossbeam Project\u00bbCrossbeam\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.8.7cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.39%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-10-31  0.38%  0.42%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-21  0.31%  0.38%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-05-09  0.24%  0.31%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-10-07  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-09-23  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-09-08  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-07-29  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-20  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/releases/tag/crossbeam-utils-0.8.7", "ref_desc": "Release crossbeam-utils 0.8.7 \u00b7 crossbeam-rs/crossbeam \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/781", "ref_desc": "Fix unsoundness of AtomicCell<*64> arithmetics on 32-bit targets that support Atomic*64 by taiki-e \u00b7 Pull Request #781 \u00b7 crossbeam-rs/crossbeam \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/security/advisories/GHSA-qc84-gqf4-9926", "ref_desc": "Unsoundness of AtomicCell<{i,u}64> arithmetics on 32-bit targets that support Atomic{I,U}64 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 crossbeam-rs/crossbeam \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
