{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21656", "Description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. The default_validator.cc implementation used to implement the default certificate validation routines has a \"type confusion\" bug when processing subjectAltNames. This processing allows, for example, an rfc822Name or uniformResourceIndicator to be authenticated as a domain name. This confusion allows for the bypassing of nameConstraints, as processed by the underlying OpenSSL/BoringSSL implementation, exposing the possibility of impersonation of arbitrary servers. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21656", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.20.2cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-15  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-05  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-27  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/843/Access-of-Resource-Using-Incompatible-Type-Type-Confusion-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-c9g7-xwcv-pjx2", "ref_desc": "X.509 subjectAltName matching (and nameConstraints) bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/bb95af848c939cfe5b5ee33c5b1770558077e64e", "ref_desc": "Specify type for matching Subject Alternative Name.
