{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46170", "Description": "CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46170", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCodeigniter\u00bbCodeigniterVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.11cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter:codeigniter:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.20%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-14  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-03  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-01-24  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-12-29  0.11%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-11-22  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/security/advisories/GHSA-6cq5-8cj7-g558", "ref_desc": "Potential Session Handlers Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/commit/f9fb6574fbeb5a4aa63f7ea87296523e10db9328", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-6cq5-8cj7-g558 \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4@f9fb657 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
