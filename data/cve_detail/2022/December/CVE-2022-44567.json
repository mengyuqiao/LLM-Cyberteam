To exploit the vulnerability, the internal video chat window must be disabled or a Mac App Store build must be used (internalVideoChatWindow.ts#L14). The vulnerability may be exploited by an XSS attack because the function openInternalVideoChatWindow is exposed in the Rocket.Chat-Desktop-API.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-44567", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nRocket.chat\u00bbRocket.chatVersions  before (<) 3.8.14cpe:2.3:a:rocket.chat:rocket.chat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.34%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-15  0.32%  0.34%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-04  0.33%  0.32%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-01-25  0.37%  0.33%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-12-30  0.23%  0.37%  +0.15 \n 6  2023-11-23  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.20%  -0.96 \n 8  2023-01-05  2.72%  1.16%  -1.57 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1781102", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
