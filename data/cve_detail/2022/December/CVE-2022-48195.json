{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-48195", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Mellium mellium.im/sasl before 0.3.1. When performing SCRAM-based SASL authentication, if the remote end advertises support for channel binding, no random nonce is generated (instead, the nonce is empty). This causes authentication to fail in the best case, but (if paired with a remote end that does not validate the length of the nonce) could lead to insufficient randomness being used during authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48195", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMellium\u00bbSasl\u00bbVersion:0.3.0cpe:2.3:a:mellium:sasl:0.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-23  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-12  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-01  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-01-06  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-11-30  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mellium.im/cve/cve-2022-48195/", "ref_desc": "Mellium \u2014 CVE-2022-48195Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
