{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41272", "Description": "An unauthenticated attacker over the network can attach to an open interface exposed through JNDI by the User Defined Search (UDS) of SAP NetWeaver Process Integration (PI) - version 7.50 and make use of an open naming and directory API to access services which can be used to perform unauthorized operations affecting users and data across the entire system. This allows the attacker to have full read access to user data, make limited modifications to user data, and degrade the performance of the system, leading to a high impact on confidentiality and a limited impact on the availability and integrity of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41272", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbNetweaver Process Integration\u00bbVersion:7.50cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_process_integration:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-05  0.23%  0.23%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-25  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-01-14  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-12-19  0.11%  0.18%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-11-12  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 \n 7  2023-02-23  9.03%  0.89%  -8.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3273480", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/02/fa865ea4-167e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html", "ref_desc": "SAP Patch Day BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sSrRPvgCRYFgD7GfxMc3pkzb8gk.html"}]}
