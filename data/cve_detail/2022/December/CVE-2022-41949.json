{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41949", "Description": "DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture, management, validation, analytics and visualization. In affected versions an authenticated DHIS2 user can craft a request to DHIS2 to instruct the server to make requests to external resources (like third party servers). This could allow an attacker, for example, to identify vulnerable services which might not be otherwise exposed to the public internet or to determine whether a specific file is present on the DHIS2 server. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1, 2.37.8.1, 2.38.2.1, 2.39.0.1. At this time, there is no known workaround or mitigation for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41949", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.34.0andbefore (<) 2.36.12.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.38.0andbefore (<) 2.38.2.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.37.0andbefore (<) 2.37.8.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2\u00bbVersion:2.39.0cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:2.39.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/commit/dc3166c216da53e12a16bfdc51055823b838c1c3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #66 from netroms/final_sec_merge_2.36.12.1 \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-core@dc3166c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/security/advisories/GHSA-6qh9-rxc8-7943", "ref_desc": "Semi-blind SSRF \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-core \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
