{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41960", "Description": "BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.3, are subject to Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, resulting in Denial of Service. An attacker can make a Meteor call to `validateAuthToken` using a victim's userId, meetingId, and an invalid authToken. This forces the victim to leave the conference, because the resulting verification failure is also observed and handled by the victim's client. The attacker must be a participant in any meeting on the server. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. There are no workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41960", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebuttonVersions  before (<) 2.4.3cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-22  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.4.3", "ref_desc": "Release BigBlueButton 2.4.3 \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1cuOE6r_GnL3trhWxUIiiMkogPU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-rgjp-3r74-g4cm", "ref_desc": "DoS via failed authToken validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.5-alpha-1", "ref_desc": "Release BigBlueButton 2.5-alpha-1 \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kvwcosyx-n116LhedkbhSH4GUFg.html"}]}
