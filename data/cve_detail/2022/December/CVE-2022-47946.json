{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-47946", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.10.x before 5.10.155. A use-after-free in io_sqpoll_wait_sq in fs/io_uring.c allows an attacker to crash the kernel, resulting in denial of service. finish_wait can be skipped. An attack can occur in some situations by forking a process and then quickly terminating it. NOTE: later kernel versions, such as the 5.15 longterm series, substantially changed the implementation of io_sqpoll_wait_sq.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47946", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 5.10andbefore (<) 5.10.155cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-13  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-15  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?h=v5.10.161&id=0f544353fec8e717d37724d95b92538e1de79e86", "ref_desc": "kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treeMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/12/27/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: Linux kernel: use-after-free in io_sqpoll_wait_sqMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/12/22/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Linux kernel: use-after-free in io_sqpoll_wait_sqExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
