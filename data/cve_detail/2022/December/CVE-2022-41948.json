{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41948", "Description": "DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture, management, validation, analytics and visualization. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A DHIS2 user with authority to manage users can assign superuser privileges to themself by manually crafting an HTTP PUT request. Only users with the following DHIS2 user role authorities can exploit this vulnerability. Note that in many systems the only users with user admin privileges are also superusers. In these cases, the escalation vulnerability does not exist. The vulnerability is only exploitable by attackers who can authenticate as users with the user admin authority. As this is usually a small and relatively trusted set of users, exploit vectors will often be limited. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1, 2.37.8.1, 2.38.2.1, 2.39.0.1. The only known workaround to this issue is to avoid the assignment of the user management authority to any users until the patch has been applied.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41948", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.34.0andbefore (<) 2.36.12.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.38.0andbefore (<) 2.38.2.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.37.0andbefore (<) 2.37.8.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2\u00bbVersion:2.39.0cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:2.39.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-30  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-20  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-15  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/security/advisories/GHSA-59fm-8432-2426", "ref_desc": "Privilege Chaining with the user admin role in dhis2-core \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-core \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
