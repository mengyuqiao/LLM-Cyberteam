{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46171", "Description": "Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. The filesystem glob pattern wildcards `*`, `?`, and `[...]` match file path literals and leading dots by default, which unintentionally exposes sub folder content of allowed paths. Scopes without the wildcards are not affected. As `**` allows for sub directories the behavior there is also as expected. The issue has been patched in the latest release and was backported into the currently supported 1.x branches. There are no known workarounds at the time of publication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46171", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nTauri\u00bbTauriVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 1.1.3cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTauri\u00bbTauriVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.0.8cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTauri\u00bbTauriVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andbefore (<) 1.2.3cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTauri\u00bbTauri\u00bbVersion:2.0.0UpdateAlpha0cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:2.0.0:alpha0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTauri\u00bbTauri\u00bbVersion:2.0.0UpdateAlpha1cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:2.0.0:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-15  0.10%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2023-12-30  0.07%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-11-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/f0602e7c294245ab6ef6fbf2a976ef398340ef58", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri@f0602e7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5", "ref_desc": "The Filesystem Scope Glob Pattern is too Permissive \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/72389b00d7b495ffd7750eb1e75a3b8537d07cf3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri@72389b0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
