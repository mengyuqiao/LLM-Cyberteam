{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-47577", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the endpoint protection agent in Zoho ManageEngine Device Control Plus 10.1.2228.15. Despite configuring complete restrictions on USB pendrives, USB HDD devices, memory cards, USB connections to mobile devices, etc., it is still possible to bypass the USB restrictions by making use of a virtual machine (VM). This allows a file to be exchanged outside the laptop/system. VMs can be created by any user (even without admin rights). The data exfiltration can occur without any record in the audit trail of Windows events on the host machine. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"it's not a vulnerability in our product.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47577", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZohocorp\u00bbManageengine Device Control Plus\u00bbVersion:10.1.2228.15cpe:2.3:a:zohocorp:manageengine_device_control_plus:10.1.2228.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-19  0.06%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/nestedif/vulnerability-disclosure-business-logic-unauthorized-data-exfiltration-bypassing-dlp-zoho-cc51465ba84a", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability Disclosure -Business logic: Unauthorised Data Exfiltration Bypassing DLP @ Zoho Device Control Plus | by Kartik Lalan | NestedIf | Dec, 2022 | MediumExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/clUaASFnqj6hwCJXL0IMK-fCM_g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.manageengine.com/device-control/how-to/device-control.html", "ref_desc": "Device Control - ManageEngine Device Control PlusVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Sl29LiPqz42pJEn6KdqG9rEp5Yc.html"}]}
