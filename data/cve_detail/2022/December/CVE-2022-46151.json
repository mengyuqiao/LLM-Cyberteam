{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46151", "Description": "Querybook is an open source data querying UI. In affected versions user provided data is not escaped in the error field of the auth callback url in `querybook/server/app/auth/oauth_auth.py` and `querybook/server/app/auth/okta_auth.py`. This may allow attackers to perform reflected cross site scripting (XSS) if Content Security Policy (CSP) is not enabled or `unsafe-inline` is allowed. Users are advised to upgrade to the latest, patched version of querybook (version 3.14.2 or greater). Users unable to upgrade may enable CSP and not allow unsafe-inline or manually escape query parameters in a reverse proxy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46151", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPinterest\u00bbQuerybookVersions  before (<) 3.14.2cpe:2.3:a:pinterest:querybook:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-05  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/commit/88a7f10495bf5ed1a556ade51a2f2794e403c063", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-mrrw-9wf7-xq6w \u00b7 pinterest/querybook@88a7f10 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/security/advisories/GHSA-mrrw-9wf7-xq6w", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pinterest/querybook \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
