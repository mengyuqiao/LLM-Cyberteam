{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46179", "Description": "LiuOS is a small Python project meant to imitate the functions of a regular operating system. Version 0.1.0 and prior of LiuOS allow an attacker to set the GITHUB_ACTIONS environment variable to anything other than null or true and skip authentication checks. This issue is patched in the latest commit (c658b4f3e57258acf5f6207a90c2f2169698ae22) by requiring the var to be set to true, causing a test script to run instead of being able to login. A potential workaround is to check for the GITHUB_ACTIONS environment variable and set it to \"\" (no quotes) to null the variable and force credential checks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46179", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLiuos Project\u00bbLiuos\u00bbVersion:0.1.0cpe:2.3:a:liuos_project:liuos:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-07-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LiuWoodsCode/LiuOS/commit/c658b4f3e57258acf5f6207a90c2f2169698ae22", "ref_desc": "Fix authentication bypass exploit \u00b7 LiuWoodsCode/LiuOS@c658b4f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LiuWoodsCode/LiuOS/security/advisories/GHSA-f9x3-mj2r-cqmf", "ref_desc": "Authentication bypass via env vars \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LiuWoodsCode/LiuOS \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
