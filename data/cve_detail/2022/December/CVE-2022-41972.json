{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41972", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to 4.9 contain a NULL Pointer Dereference in BLE L2CAP module. The Contiki-NG operating system for IoT devices contains a Bluetooth Low Energy stack. An attacker can inject a packet in this stack, which causes the implementation to dereference a NULL pointer and triggers undefined behavior. More specifically, while processing the L2CAP protocol, the implementation maps an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. In this structure, state information regarding credits is managed through calls to the function input_l2cap_credit in the module os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c. Unfortunately, the input_l2cap_credit function does not check that the metadata corresponding to the user-supplied channel ID actually exists, which can lead to the channel variable being set to NULL before a pointer dereferencing operation is performed. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2253 as a workaround until the new package is released.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41972", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-08  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-18  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-24xp-g5gf-6vvm", "ref_desc": "Invalid memory access in the BLE L2CAP module \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2253", "ref_desc": "Add missing NULL check in ble-l2cap by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #2253 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
