{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46173", "Description": "Elrond-GO is a go implementation for the Elrond Network protocol. Versions prior to 1.3.50 are subject to a processing issue where nodes are affected when trying to process a cross-shard relayed transaction with a smart contract deploy transaction data. The problem was a bad correlation between the transaction caches and the processing component. If the above-mentioned transaction was sent with more gas than required, the smart contract result (SCR transaction) that should have returned the leftover gas, would have been wrongly added to a cache that the processing unit did not consider. The node stopped notarizing metachain blocks. The fix was actually to extend the SCR transaction search in all other caches if it wasn't found in the correct (expected) sharded-cache. There are no known workarounds at this time. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.50.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46173", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElrond\u00bbElrond GoVersions  before (<) 1.3.50cpe:2.3:a:elrond:elrond_go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-20  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-06-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-30  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-04  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-11-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-669 Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/669/Incorrect-Resource-Transfer-Between-Spheres.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/pull/4718", "ref_desc": "Improve SCR lookup in smartcontract preprocessor by iulianpascalau \u00b7 Pull Request #4718 \u00b7 ElrondNetwork/elrond-go \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/commit/39d7ddcb08bb34217dab6daef7cd9d287fb8cab3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #4718 from ElrondNetwork/test-scr-processor-lookup \u00b7 ElrondNetwork/elrond-go@39d7ddc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/security/advisories/GHSA-p228-4mrh-ww7r", "ref_desc": "Processing: fallback search of SCRs when not found in the main cache \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ElrondNetwork/elrond-go \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
