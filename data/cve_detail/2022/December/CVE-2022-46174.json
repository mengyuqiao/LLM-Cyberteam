{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46174", "Description": "efs-utils is a set of Utilities for Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). A potential race condition issue exists within the Amazon EFS mount helper in efs-utils versions v1.34.3 and below. When using TLS to mount file systems, the mount helper allocates a local port for stunnel to receive NFS connections prior to applying the TLS tunnel. In affected versions, concurrent mount operations can allocate the same local port, leading to either failed mount operations or an inappropriate mapping from an EFS customer\u2019s local mount points to that customer\u2019s EFS file systems. This issue is patched in version v1.34.4. There is no recommended work around. We recommend affected users update the installed version of efs-utils to v1.34.4 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46174", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbEfs-utilsVersions  before (<) 1.34.4cpe:2.3:a:amazon:efs-utils:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbElastic File System Container Storage Interface Driver\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.4.8cpe:2.3:a:amazon:elastic_file_system_container_storage_interface_driver:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-04  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/efs-utils/security/advisories/GHSA-4fv8-w65m-3932", "ref_desc": "Race condition during concurrent TLS mounts in efs-utils and aws-efs-csi-driver \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aws/efs-utils \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/efs-utils/issues/125", "ref_desc": "Mounting several volumes at once fails very frequently \u00b7 Issue #125 \u00b7 aws/efs-utils \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/efs-utils/commit/f3a8f88167d55caa2f78aeb72d4dc1987a9ed62d", "ref_desc": "Fix potential tlsport selection collision by using state file as \u00b7 aws/efs-utils@f3a8f88 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
