{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46175", "Description": "JSON5 is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be easier to write and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files). The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46175", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code;Gain privilege;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJson5\u00bbJson5\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.0.2cpe:2.3:a:json5:json5:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nJson5\u00bbJson5\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.2cpe:2.3:a:json5:json5:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.85% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.45%  0.85%  -0.60 \n 2  2024-11-22  1.03%  1.45%  +0.42 \n 3  2024-08-14  0.67%  1.03%  +0.36 \n 4  2024-07-31  0.55%  0.67%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-07-16  0.57%  0.55%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-03-30  0.52%  0.57%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-01-25  0.40%  0.52%  +0.11 \n 8  2023-12-30  0.28%  0.40%  +0.12 \n 9  2023-11-26  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-11-23  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 11  2023-07-08  0.23%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 12  2023-05-08  0.26%  0.23%  -0.04 \n 13  2023-03-07  39.27%  0.26%  -39.00 \n 14  2023-01-04  32.56%  39.27%  +6.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/199", "ref_desc": "Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00021.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3665-1] node-json5 security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3S26TLPLVFAJTUN3VIXFDEBEXDYO22CE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: pgadmin4-6.19-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/298", "ref_desc": "Backport fix for CVE-2022-46175 to v1 by ashkulz \u00b7 Pull Request #298 \u00b7 json5/json5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3S26TLPLVFAJTUN3VIXFDEBEXDYO22CE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: pgadmin4-6.19-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution in JSON5 via Parse Method \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 json5/json5 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/295", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution in JSON5 \u00b7 Issue #295 \u00b7 json5/json5 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
