Prior to versions 23.0.11, 24.0.7, and 25.0.0, there is no password length limit when creating a user as an administrator. An administrator can cause a limited DoS attack against their own server. Versions 23.0.11, 24.0.7, and 25.0.0 contain a fix for the issue. As a workaround, don't create user accounts with long passwords.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41969", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 23.0.0andbefore (<) 23.0.11cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 23.0.0andbefore (<) 23.0.11cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.7cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.7cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-23  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-08  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/34500", "ref_desc": "Fix password length limitation by nickvergessen \u00b7 Pull Request #34500 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-4gm7-j7wg-m4fx", "ref_desc": "No password length limit when creating a user as an administrator \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1727424", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
