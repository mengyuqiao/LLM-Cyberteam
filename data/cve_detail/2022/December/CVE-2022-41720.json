{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41720", "Description": "On Windows, restricted files can be accessed via os.DirFS and http.Dir. The os.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of files rooted at a given directory. These functions permit access to Windows device files under that root. For example, os.DirFS(\"C:/tmp\").Open(\"COM1\") opens the COM1 device. Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access. In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory (the root of the current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path to escape from the drive and access any path on the system. With fix applied, the behavior of os.DirFS(\"\") has changed. Previously, an empty root was treated equivalently to \"/\", so os.DirFS(\"\").Open(\"tmp\") would open the path \"/tmp\". This now returns an error.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41720", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGolang\u00bbGOVersions  from including (>=) 1.19.0andbefore (<) 1.19.4cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGolang\u00bbGOVersions  before (<) 1.18.9cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 3  2024-05-19  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-09  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-12-14  0.07%  0.14%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-11-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-08  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-04-11  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 9  2023-03-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 \n 11  2023-02-23  15.35%  1.02%  -14.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://go.dev/cl/455716", "ref_desc": "os, net/http: avoid escapes from os.DirFS and http.Dir on Windows (I275b5fa3) \u00b7 Gerrit Code ReviewPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/L_3rmdT0BMU/m/yZDrXjIiBQAJ", "ref_desc": "[security] Go 1.19.4 and Go 1.18.9 are releasedPatch;Release Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fM4yfMP2y8A6MrJLGAcP01woKHc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1143", "ref_desc": "GO-2022-1143 - Go PackagesPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://go.dev/issue/56694", "ref_desc": "os, net/http: avoid escapes from os.DirFS and http.Dir on Windows CVE-2022-41720 \u00b7 Issue #56694 \u00b7 golang/go \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
