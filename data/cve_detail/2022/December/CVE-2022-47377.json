{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-47377", "Description": "Password recovery vulnerability in SICK SIM2000ST Partnumber 2086502 with firmware version <1.13.4 allows an unprivileged remote attacker to gain access to the userlevel defined as RecoverableUserLevel by invocating the password recovery mechanism method. This leads to an increase in their privileges on the system and thereby affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system. An attacker can expect repeatable success by exploiting the vulnerability. The recommended solution is to update the firmware to a version >= 1.13.4 as soon as possible (available in SICK Support Portal).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47377", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSick\u00bbSim2000 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.13.4cpe:2.3:o:sick:sim2000_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Sick\u00bbSim2000st\u00bbVersion:N/AForLFTWhen used together with:Sick\u00bbSim2000st\u00bbVersion:N/AForPPC", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.40%  0.35%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-11-30  0.37%  0.40%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-07-23  0.35%  0.37%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-07-08  0.30%  0.35%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-05-28  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-01-18  0.27%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-12-23  0.16%  0.27%  +0.10 \n 8  2023-11-16  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sick.com/psirt", "ref_desc": "The SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT) | SICKVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v6inTk1Bf2cm1HoZcfS_iK5G0TQ.html"}]}
