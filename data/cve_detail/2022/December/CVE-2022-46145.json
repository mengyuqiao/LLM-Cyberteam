{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46145", "Description": "authentik is an open-source identity provider. Versions prior to 2022.11.2 and 2022.10.2 are vulnerable to unauthorized user creation and potential account takeover. With the default flows, unauthenticated users can create new accounts in authentik. If a flow exists that allows for email-verified password recovery, this can be used to overwrite the email address of admin accounts and take over their accounts. authentik 2022.11.2 and 2022.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, a policy can be created and bound to the `default-user-settings-flow flow` with the contents `return request.user.is_authenticated`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46145", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGoauthentik\u00bbAuthentikVersions  from including (>=) 2022.11andbefore (<) 2022.11.2cpe:2.3:a:goauthentik:authentik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoauthentik\u00bbAuthentikVersions  before (<) 2022.10.2cpe:2.3:a:goauthentik:authentik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.38%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-07-23  0.22%  0.26%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-07-09  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-06-24  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-14  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-01-04  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-12-09  0.10%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-11-02  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-06-24  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-mjfw-54m5-fvjf", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized user creation and potential account takeover \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://goauthentik.io/docs/releases/2022.11#fixed-in-2022112", "ref_desc": "Release 2022.11 | authentikRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://goauthentik.io/docs/releases/2022.10#fixed-in-2022102", "ref_desc": "Release 2022.10 | authentikRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
