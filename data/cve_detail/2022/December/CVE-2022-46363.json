{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46363", "Description": "A vulnerability in Apache CXF before versions 3.5.5 and 3.4.10 allows an attacker to perform a remote directory listing or code exfiltration. The vulnerability only applies when the CXFServlet is configured with both the static-resources-list and redirect-query-check attributes. These attributes are not supposed to be used together, and so the vulnerability can only arise if the CXF service is misconfigured.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46363", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCXFVersions  from including (>=) 3.5.0andbefore (<) 3.5.5cpe:2.3:a:apache:cxf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbCXFVersions  before (<) 3.4.10cpe:2.3:a:apache:cxf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-09  0.09%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2024-05-25  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2024-01-15  0.12%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-01-02  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 5  2023-12-20  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-12-09  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/pdzo1qgyplf4y523tnnzrcm7hoco3l8c", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-46363: Apache CXF directory listing / code exfiltration-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
