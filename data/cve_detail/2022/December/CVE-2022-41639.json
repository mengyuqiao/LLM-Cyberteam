{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41639", "Description": "A heap based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in tile decoding code of TIFF image parser in OpenImageIO master-branch-9aeece7a and v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted TIFF file can lead to an out of bounds memory corruption, which can result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41639", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenimageio\u00bbOpenimageio\u00bbVersion:2.3.19.0cpe:2.3:a:openimageio:openimageio:2.3.19.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.88% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.99%  0.88%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.97%  0.99%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-12  0.52%  0.97%  +0.45 \n 4  2024-07-29  0.37%  0.52%  +0.16 \n 5  2024-07-14  0.36%  0.37%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-06-03  0.34%  0.36%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-01-24  0.31%  0.34%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-12-29  0.18%  0.31%  +0.12 \n 9  2023-11-22  0.16%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-05-30  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.12%  -0.97 \n 12  2023-02-23  15.36%  1.09%  -14.28 \n 13  2023-02-02  19.46%  15.36%  -4.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-33", "ref_desc": "OpenImageIO: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202305-33) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/j37E7FTWnohE1gbAt-HBjdQu2CM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5384", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5384-1 openimageioThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ql-n_xBGRbkXGaCAOJAq3-5txFc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1633", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
