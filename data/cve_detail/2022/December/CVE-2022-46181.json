{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46181", "Description": "Gotify server is a simple server for sending and receiving messages in real-time per WebSocket. Versions prior to 2.2.2 contain an XSS vulnerability that allows authenticated users to upload .html files. An attacker could execute client side scripts **if** another user opened a link. The attacker could potentially take over the account of the user that clicked the link. The Gotify UI won't natively expose such a malicious link, so an attacker has to get the user to open the malicious link in a context outside of Gotify. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 2.2.2. As a workaround, you can block access to non image files via a reverse proxy in the `./image` directory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46181", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGotify\u00bbServerVersions  before (<) 2.2.2cpe:2.3:a:gotify:server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-05  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 \n 5  2023-01-10  0.95%  0.89%  -0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gotify/server/security/advisories/GHSA-xv6x-456v-24xh", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability in the application image file upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gotify/server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gotify/server/pull/534", "ref_desc": "Fix file upload XSS by jmattheis \u00b7 Pull Request #534 \u00b7 gotify/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gotify/server/pull/535", "ref_desc": "Only serve image files on ./image by jmattheis \u00b7 Pull Request #535 \u00b7 gotify/server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
