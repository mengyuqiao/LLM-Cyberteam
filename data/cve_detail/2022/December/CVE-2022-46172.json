{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46172", "Description": "authentik is an open-source Identity provider focused on flexibility and versatility. In versions prior to 2022.10.4, and 2022.11.4, any authenticated user can create an arbitrary number of accounts through the default flows. This would circumvent any policy in a situation where it is undesirable for users to create new accounts by themselves. This may also affect other applications as these new basic accounts would exist throughout the SSO infrastructure. By default the newly created accounts cannot be logged into as no password reset exists by default. However password resets are likely to be enabled by most installations. This vulnerability pertains to the user context used in the default-user-settings-flow, /api/v3/flows/instances/default-user-settings-flow/execute/. This issue has been fixed in versions 2022.10.4 and 2022.11.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46172", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGoauthentik\u00bbAuthentikVersions  from including (>=) 2022.11.0andbefore (<) 2022.11.4cpe:2.3:a:goauthentik:authentik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoauthentik\u00bbAuthentikVersions  from including (>=) 2022.10.0andbefore (<) 2022.10.4cpe:2.3:a:goauthentik:authentik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-hv8r-6w7p-mpc5", "ref_desc": "Existing Authenticated Users can Create Arbitrary Accounts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
