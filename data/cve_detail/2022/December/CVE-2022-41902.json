{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41902", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41902", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.10.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.10.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-28  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-05-18  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-01-08  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-12-13  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-11-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/grappler/utils/functions.cc#L221", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/functions.cc at master \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/aPI3FpsxzszJ5rF7lGNOlBTBHig.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cg88-rpvp-cjv5", "ref_desc": "OOB write in grappler \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7", "ref_desc": "Fix OOB write in grappler. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@a65411a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pKXoHlH8bQeK6na2DR6-qMVyVv8.html"}]}
