{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41966", "Description": "XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41966", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nXstream Project\u00bbXstreamVersions  before (<) 1.4.20cpe:2.3:a:xstream_project:xstream:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.00%  0.80%  -0.20 \n 2  2024-07-19  1.01%  1.00%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-06-08  0.46%  1.01%  +0.56 \n 4  2024-04-02  0.32%  0.46%  +0.13 \n 5  2024-02-23  0.16%  0.32%  +0.16 \n 6  2024-01-03  0.10%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-11-27  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-j563-grx4-pjpv", "ref_desc": "XStream can cause a Denial of Service by injecting recursive collections or maps based on element's hash values raising a stack overflow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 x-stream/xstream \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-41966.html", "ref_desc": "XStream - CVE-2022-41966Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
