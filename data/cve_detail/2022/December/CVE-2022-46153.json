{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46153", "Description": "Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In affected versions there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing TLS connections. A router configured with a not well-formatted TLSOption is exposed with an empty TLSOption. For instance, a route secured using an mTLS connection set with a wrong CA file is exposed without verifying the client certificates. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.9.6. Users unable to upgrade should check their logs to detect the error messages and fix your TLS options.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46153", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTraefik\u00bbTraefikVersions  before (<) 2.9.6cpe:2.3:a:traefik:traefik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-30  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 2  2023-12-15  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.9/https/tls/#tls-options", "ref_desc": "Traefik TLS Documentation | Traefik | v2.9Product;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.9.6", "ref_desc": "Release v2.9.6 \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nrlBTW8bZI_9ApNlxp0wmfSu7ss.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/commit/7e3fe48b80083b41e9ff82a474a36484cabc701a", "ref_desc": "Handle broken TLS conf better \u00b7 traefik/traefik@7e3fe48 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/security/advisories/GHSA-468w-8x39-gj5v", "ref_desc": "Routes exposed with an empty TLSOption \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
