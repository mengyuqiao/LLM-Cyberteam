{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-38097", "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Software's PDF Reader, version 12.0.1.12430. By prematurely destroying annotation objects, a specially-crafted PDF document can trigger the reuse of previously freed memory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially-crafted, malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38097", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nFoxit\u00bbPdf Reader\u00bbVersion:12.0.1.12430cpe:2.3:a:foxit:pdf_reader:12.0.1.12430:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.53% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.38%  0.53%  +0.16 \n 2  2024-08-29  0.26%  0.38%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-08-14  0.07%  0.26%  +0.20 \n 4  2024-06-02  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-04-22  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-04-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-02-28  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 8  2024-02-09  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 9  2024-01-05  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-12-24  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.06%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1601", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2022-1601 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
