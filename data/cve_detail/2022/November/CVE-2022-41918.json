{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41918", "Description": "OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana. There is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where they are not correctly applied to the indices that back data streams potentially leading to incorrect access authorization. OpenSearch 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41918", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  before (<) 1.3.7cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-07  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-22  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-10-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-612 Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/612/Improper-Authorization-of-Index-Containing-Sensitive-Informa.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/commit/f7cc569c9d3fa5d5432c76c854eed280d45ce6f4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wmx7-x4jp-9jgg \u00b7 opensearch-project/security@f7cc569 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-wmx7-x4jp-9jgg", "ref_desc": "Issue with fine-grained access control of indices backing data streams \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/security \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
