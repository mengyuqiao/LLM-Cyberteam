{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41882", "Description": "The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with your computer. In version 3.6.0, if a user received a malicious file share and has it synced locally or the virtual filesystem enabled and clicked a nc://open/ link it will open the default editor for the file type of the shared file, which on Windows can also sometimes mean that a file depending on the type, e.g. \"vbs\", is being executed. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to version 3.6.1. As a workaround, users can block the Nextcloud Desktop client 3.6.0 by setting the `minimum.supported.desktop.version` system config to `3.6.1` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing files can still be used. Another workaround would be to enforce shares to be accepted by setting the `sharing.force_share_accept` system config to `true` on the server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded anymore. Already existing shares can still be abused.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41882", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbDesktop\u00bbVersion:3.6.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.6.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-18  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-02  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-07-24  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 \n 7  2023-02-23  1.79%  1.02%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/5039", "ref_desc": "Bugfix/check token for edit locally requests by mgallien \u00b7 Pull Request #5039 \u00b7 nextcloud/desktop \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/releases/tag/v3.6.1", "ref_desc": "Release Release 3.6.1 \u00b7 nextcloud/desktop \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/34559", "ref_desc": "Require token for local editing by nickvergessen \u00b7 Pull Request #34559 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-3w86-rm38-8w63", "ref_desc": "Desktop client can be tricked into opening/executing local files when clicking a nc://open/ link \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
