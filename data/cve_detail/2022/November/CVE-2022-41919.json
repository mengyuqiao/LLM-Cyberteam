{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41919", "Description": "Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type\u2019s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack. This issue has been patched in version 4.10.2 and 3.29.4. As a workaround, implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using `@fastify/csrf'.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41919", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nFastify\u00bbFastify\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.10.2cpe:2.3:a:fastify:fastify:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nFastify\u00bbFastify\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.29.4cpe:2.3:a:fastify:fastify:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-13  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-05-04  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-29  0.05%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-10-23  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastify/csrf", "ref_desc": "@fastify/csrf - npmProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjj-p79j-c9hh", "ref_desc": "Incorrect Content-Type parsing can lead to CSRF attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fastify/fastify \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/62dde76f1f7aca76e38625fe8d983761f26e6fc9", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-3fjj-p79j-c9hh \u00b7 fastify/fastify@62dde76 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
