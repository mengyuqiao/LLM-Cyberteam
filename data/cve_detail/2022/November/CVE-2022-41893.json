{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41893", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `tf.raw_ops.TensorListResize` is given a nonscalar value for input `size`, it results `CHECK` fail which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 888e34b49009a4e734c27ab0c43b0b5102682c56. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41893", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.10.0andbefore (<) 2.10.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-25  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-12-21  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-25  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-10-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/list_kernels.cc", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/list_kernels.cc at master \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-67pf-62xr-q35m", "ref_desc": "`CHECK_EQ` fail in `tf.raw_ops.TensorListResize` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/888e34b49009a4e734c27ab0c43b0b5102682c56", "ref_desc": "Fix tf.raw_ops.TensorListResize vulnerability with non-scalar input. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@888e34b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
