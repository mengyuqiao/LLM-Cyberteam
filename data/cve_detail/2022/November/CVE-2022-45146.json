{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-45146", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the FIPS Java API of Bouncy Castle BC-FJA before 1.0.2.4. Changes to the JVM garbage collector in Java 13 and later trigger an issue in the BC-FJA FIPS modules where it is possible for temporary keys used by the module to be zeroed out while still in use by the module, resulting in errors or potential information loss. NOTE: FIPS compliant users are unaffected because the FIPS certification is only for Java 7, 8, and 11.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45146", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBouncycastle\u00bbFips Java ApiVersions  before (<) 1.0.2.4cpe:2.3:a:bouncycastle:fips_java_api:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Oracle\u00bbJDK", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bc-fips", "ref_desc": "Maven Repository: org.bouncycastle \u00bb bc-fips", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html", "ref_desc": "bouncycastle.orgRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OWouKhtWPsp4P9_cV6rtth3iaAQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/wiki/CVE-2022-45146", "ref_desc": "CVE 2022 45146 \u00b7 bcgit/bc-java Wiki \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
