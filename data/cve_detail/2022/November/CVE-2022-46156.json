{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46156", "Description": "The Synthetic Monitoring Agent for Grafana's Synthetic Monitoring application provides probe functionality and executes network checks for monitoring remote targets. Users running the Synthetic Monitoring agent prior to version 0.12.0 in their local network are impacted. The authentication token used to communicate with the Synthetic Monitoring API is exposed through a debugging endpoint. This token can be used to retrieve the Synthetic Monitoring checks created by the user and assigned to the agent identified with that token. The Synthetic Monitoring API will reject connections from already-connected agents, so access to the token does not guarantee access to the checks. Version 0.12.0 contains a fix. Users are advised to rotate the agent tokens. After upgrading to version v0.12.0 or later, it's recommended that users of distribution packages review the configuration stored in `/etc/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-monitoring-agent.conf`, specifically the `API_TOKEN` variable which has been renamed to `SM_AGENT_API_TOKEN`. As a workaround for previous versions, it's recommended that users review the agent settings and set the HTTP listening address in a manner that limits the exposure, for example, localhost or a non-routed network, by using the command line parameter `-listen-address`, e.g. `-listen-address localhost:4050`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46156", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGrafana\u00bbSynthetic Monitoring AgentVersions  before (<) 0.12.0cpe:2.3:a:grafana:synthetic_monitoring_agent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.05%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-489 Active Debug Code", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/489/Active-Debug-Code.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-749 Exposed Dangerous Method or Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/749/Exposed-Dangerous-Method-or-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/releases/tag/v0.12.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.12.0 \u00b7 grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/commit/d8dc7f9c1c641881cbcf0a09e178b90ebf0f0228", "ref_desc": "Fix: allow getting API token from environment \u00b7 grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent@d8dc7f9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-9j4f-f249-q5w8", "ref_desc": "Default installation of `synthetic-monitoring-agent` exposes sensitive information \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/pull/375", "ref_desc": "Fix: default to listening on localhost, not all interfaces by mem \u00b7 Pull Request #375 \u00b7 grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/pull/373", "ref_desc": "Add flag to enable HTTP pprof endpoint by adriansr \u00b7 Pull Request #373 \u00b7 grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent/pull/374", "ref_desc": "Fix: allow getting API token from environment by mem \u00b7 Pull Request #374 \u00b7 grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
