{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-44796", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. The authorization service has a flow that allows getting access to the Web UI without knowing credentials. For signing, the JWT token uses a secret key that is generated through a function that doesn't produce cryptographically strong sequences. An attacker can predict these sequences and generate a JWT token. As a result, an attacker can get access to the Web UI. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-44796", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nObjectfirst\u00bbObject FirstVersions  before (<) 1.0.13.1611cpe:2.3:a:objectfirst:object_first:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-30  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-19  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-09  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-13  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-10-07  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://objectfirst.com/security/of-20221024-0002/", "ref_desc": "Escalation of privileges vulnerability in Object First - Object FirstVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
