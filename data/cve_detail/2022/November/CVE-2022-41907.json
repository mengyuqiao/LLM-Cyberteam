{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41907", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `tf.raw_ops.ResizeNearestNeighborGrad` is given a large `size` input, it overflows. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 00c821af032ba9e5f5fa3fe14690c8d28a657624. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41907", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.10.0andbefore (<) 2.10.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-25  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-12-21  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-25  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-10-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/131/Incorrect-Calculation-of-Buffer-Size.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/00c821af032ba9e5f5fa3fe14690c8d28a657624", "ref_desc": "Fix tf.raw_ops.ResizeNearestNeighborGrad vulnerability with large dim\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@00c821a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/resize_nearest_neighbor_op.cc", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/resize_nearest_neighbor_op.cc at master \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-368v-7v32-52fx", "ref_desc": "Overflow in `ResizeNearestNeighborGrad` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
