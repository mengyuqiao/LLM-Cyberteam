{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41900", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The security vulnerability results in FractionalMax(AVG)Pool with illegal pooling_ratio. Attackers using Tensorflow can exploit the vulnerability. They can access heap memory which is not in the control of user, leading to a crash or remote code execution. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 216525144ee7c910296f5b05d214ca1327c9ce48. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherry pick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41900", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.10.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-10  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-30  0.15%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-12-21  0.15%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-11-25  0.11%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-10-19  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.09%  -1.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-xvwp-h6jv-7472", "ref_desc": "FractionalMaxPool and FractionalAvgPool heap out-of-buffer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/216525144ee7c910296f5b05d214ca1327c9ce48", "ref_desc": "Fix security vulnerability with FractionalMax(AVG)Pool with illegal p\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@2165251 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
