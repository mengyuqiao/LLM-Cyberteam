{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41891", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat` is given `element_shape=[]`, it results segmentation fault which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit fc33f3dc4c14051a83eec6535b608abe1d355fde. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41891", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.10.0andbefore (<) 2.10.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-25  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-02-23  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 6  2023-12-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-10-19  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-66vq-54fq-6jvv", "ref_desc": "Segfault in `tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fc33f3dc4c14051a83eec6535b608abe1d355fde", "ref_desc": "Fix tf.raw_ops.TensorListConcat vulnerability (segfault). \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@fc33f3d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/list_kernels.h", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
