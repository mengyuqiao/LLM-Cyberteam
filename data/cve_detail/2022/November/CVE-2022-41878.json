{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41878", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In versions prior to 5.3.2 or 4.10.19, keywords that are specified in the Parse Server option `requestKeywordDenylist` can be injected via Cloud Code Webhooks or Triggers. This will result in the keyword being saved to the database, bypassing the `requestKeywordDenylist` option. This issue is fixed in versions 4.10.19, and 5.3.2. If upgrade is not possible, the following Workarounds may be applied: Configure your firewall to only allow trusted servers to make request to the Parse Server Cloud Code Webhooks API, or block the API completely if you are not using the feature.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41878", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.3.2cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.10.19cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.37%  0.56%  +0.19 \n 2  2024-10-09  0.26%  0.37%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-09-12  0.29%  0.26%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-08-29  0.23%  0.29%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-06-02  0.23%  0.23%  0.00 \n 6  2024-04-22  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-11-17  0.22%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-10-11  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xprv-wvh7-qqqx", "ref_desc": "Prototype pollution via Cloud Code Webhooks or Cloud Code Triggers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
