{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41880", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When the `BaseCandidateSamplerOp` function receives a value in `true_classes` larger than `range_max`, a heap oob read occurs. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit b389f5c944cadfdfe599b3f1e4026e036f30d2d4. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41880", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.10.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.24%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-25  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-30  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 6  2023-12-21  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-25  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-10-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/candidate_sampler_ops.cc", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/candidate_sampler_ops.cc at master \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-8w5g-3wcv-9g2j", "ref_desc": "ThreadUnsafeUnigramCandidateSampler Heap OOB \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b389f5c944cadfdfe599b3f1e4026e036f30d2d4", "ref_desc": "Add true_classes input validation for candidate sampler ops. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@b389f5c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
