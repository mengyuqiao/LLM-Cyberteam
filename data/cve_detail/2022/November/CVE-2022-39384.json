{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39384", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a workaround, avoid untrusted external calls during initialization.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39384", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 4.4.1cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts Upgradeable\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 4.4.1cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts_upgradeable:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-27  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-16  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-07  0.11%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-11-11  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-10-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.05%  -1.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-665 Improper Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/665/Improper-Initialization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-9c22-pwxw-p6hx", "ref_desc": "Initializer reentrancy may lead to double initialization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PGtStauOP7XnH5g5OaTtoUoughA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3006", "ref_desc": "Update initializer modifier to prevent reentrancy during initialization by Amxx \u00b7 Pull Request #3006 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
