{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-45868", "Description": "The web-based admin console in H2 Database Engine before 2.2.220 can be started via the CLI with the argument -webAdminPassword, which allows the user to specify the password in cleartext for the web admin console. Consequently, a local user (or an attacker that has obtained local access through some means) would be able to discover the password by listing processes and their arguments. NOTE: the vendor states \"This is not a vulnerability of H2 Console ... Passwords should never be passed on the command line and every qualified DBA or system administrator is expected to know that.\" Nonetheless, the issue was fixed in 2.2.220.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45868", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nH2database\u00bbH2Versions  up to, including, (<=) 2.1.214cpe:2.3:a:h2database:h2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/h2database/h2database/releases/tag/version-2.2.220", "ref_desc": "Release Version 2.2.220 \u00b7 h2database/h2database \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/h2database/h2database/pull/3833", "ref_desc": "Disallow plain webAdminPassword values to force usage of hashes by katzyn \u00b7 Pull Request #3833 \u00b7 h2database/h2database \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sites.google.com/sonatype.com/vulnerabilities/sonatype-2022-6243", "ref_desc": "H2 Plaintext passwordExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/3686", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-45868: Password exposure in H2 Database (not an issue) \u00b7 Issue #3686 \u00b7 h2database/h2database \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj", "ref_desc": "Password exposure in H2 Database \u00b7 CVE-2022-45868 \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/h2database/h2database/blob/96832bf5a97cdc0adc1f2066ed61c54990d66ab5/h2/src/main/org/h2/server/web/WebServer.java#L346-L347", "ref_desc": "h2database/WebServer.java at 96832bf5a97cdc0adc1f2066ed61c54990d66ab5 \u00b7 h2database/h2database \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
