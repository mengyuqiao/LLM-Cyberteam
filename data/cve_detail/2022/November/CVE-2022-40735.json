{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-40735", "Description": "The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that \"(appropriately) short exponents\" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40735", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDiffie-hellman Key Exchange Project\u00bbDiffie-hellman Key Exchange\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:diffie-hellman_key_exchange_project:diffie-hellman_key_exchange:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.82% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.01%  0.82%  -0.19 \n 2  2024-07-05  0.85%  1.01%  +0.16 \n 3  2024-06-21  0.72%  0.85%  +0.13 \n 4  2024-06-06  0.61%  0.72%  +0.11 \n 5  2024-04-26  0.51%  0.61%  +0.10 \n 6  2024-04-23  0.48%  0.51%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-12-17  0.40%  0.48%  +0.08 \n 8  2023-11-21  0.32%  0.40%  +0.09 \n 9  2023-10-15  0.27%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.17%  0.27%  -1.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/", "ref_desc": "D(HE)at Attack | D(HE)at AttackCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6-0n1nzzPqDaohpG2RA2YTfSgjE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mozilla/ssl-config-generator/issues/162", "ref_desc": "Stop recommending DHE, because of \"dheater\" vulnerability \u00b7 Issue #162 \u00b7 mozilla/ssl-config-generator \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9lvcNaEV2eAgNZ2syslN710Mrbk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5114#section-4", "ref_desc": "RFC 5114: Additional Diffie-Hellman Groups for Use with IETF Standards", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf", "ref_desc": "Technical Description;Third Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3526", "ref_desc": "RFC 3526: More Modular Exponential (MODP) Diffie-Hellman groups for Internet Key Exchange (IKE)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/c0r0n3r/9455ddcab985c50fd1912eabf26e058b", "ref_desc": "Diffie-Hellman short exponent references \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-68339-9_29.pdf", "ref_desc": "Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374117", "ref_desc": "D(HE)at: A Practical Denial-of-Service Attack on the Finite Field Diffie\u2013Hellman Key Exchange | IEEE Journals & Magazine | IEEE XploreCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sB2hGucBmcLw4YmYAG881ulytAQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7919#section-5.2", "ref_desc": "RFC 7919: Negotiated Finite Field Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Parameters for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CVEProject/cvelist/9d7fbbcabd3f44cfedc9e8807757d31ece85a2c6/2022/40xxx/CVE-2022-40735.json", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4419", "ref_desc": "RFC 4419: Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anton-Stiglic-2/publication/2401745_Security_Issues_in_the_Diffie-Hellman_Key_Agreement_Protocol/links/546c144f0cf20dedafd53e7e/Security-Issues-in-the-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Agreement-Protocol.pdf", "ref_desc": "Just a moment...Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
