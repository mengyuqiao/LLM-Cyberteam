{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41938", "Description": "Flarum is an open source discussion platform. Flarum's page title system allowed for page titles to be converted into HTML DOM nodes when pages were rendered. The change was made after `v1.5` and was not noticed. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious HTML markup using a discussion title input, either by creating a new discussion or renaming one. The XSS attack occurs after a visitor opens the relevant discussion page. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` are impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core `v1.6.2`. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` have to upgrade as soon as possible to v1.6.2. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41938", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nFlarum\u00bbFlarumVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 1.6.2cpe:2.3:a:flarum:flarum:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-25  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-7x4w-j98p-854x", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability with discussion titles \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flarum/framework \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://discuss.flarum.org/d/27558", "ref_desc": "Critical security update to Flarum core, with new incident write-up (v1.0.2) - Flarum CommunityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/690de9ce0ffe7ac4d45b73e303f44340c3433138", "ref_desc": "fix: evaluated page title content (#3684) \u00b7 flarum/framework@690de9c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
