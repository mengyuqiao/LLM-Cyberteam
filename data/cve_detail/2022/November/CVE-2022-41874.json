{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41874", "Description": "Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. In versions prior to 1.0.7 and 1.1.2, Tauri is vulnerable to an Incorrectly-Resolved Name. Due to incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop functionality, it is possible to partially bypass the `fs` scope definition. It is not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths, as the issue is limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already allowed paths. The impact differs on Windows, MacOS and Linux due to different specifications of valid path characters. This bypass depends on the file picker dialog or dragged files, as user selected paths are automatically added to the allow list at runtime. A successful bypass requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory during the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to access these files. The issue has been patched in versions 1.0.7, 1.1.2 and 1.2.0. As a workaround, disable the dialog and fileDropEnabled component inside the tauri.conf.json.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41874", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTauri\u00bbTauriVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 1.1.2cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTauri\u00bbTauriVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.0.7cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 \n 6  2023-02-22  4.09%  0.89%  -3.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/706/Use-of-Incorrectly-Resolved-Name-or-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-q9wv-22m9-vhqh", "ref_desc": "The Filesystem Scope can be Partially Bypassed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
