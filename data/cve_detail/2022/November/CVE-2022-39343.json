{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39343", "Description": "Azure RTOS FileX is a FAT-compatible file system that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. In versions before 6.2.0, the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes integer under and overflows which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations. When properly crafted a log including entries of type `FX_FAULT_TOLERANT_DIR_LOG_TYPE` may be utilized to introduce unexpected behavior. This issue has been patched in version 6.2.0. A workaround to fix line 218 in fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c is documented in the GHSA.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39343", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbAzure Rtos FilexVersions  before (<) 6.2.0cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:azure_rtos_filex:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-31  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  2.84%  0.05%  -2.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/filex/security/advisories/GHSA-8jqf-wjhq-4w9f", "ref_desc": "Fault Tolerant Overflow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 azure-rtos/filex \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/filex/blob/master/common/src/fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c#L218", "ref_desc": "filex/fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c at master \u00b7 azure-rtos/filex \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
