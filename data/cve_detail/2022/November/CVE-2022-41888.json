{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41888", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When running on GPU, `tf.image.generate_bounding_box_proposals` receives a `scores` input that must be of rank 4 but is not checked. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit cf35502463a88ca7185a99daa7031df60b3c1c98. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41888", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.10.0andbefore (<) 2.10.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-25  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-02-23  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 6  2023-12-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-10-19  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cf35502463a88ca7185a99daa7031df60b3c1c98", "ref_desc": "Add rank checks to GenerateBoundingBoxProposals. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@cf35502 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/generate_box_proposals_op.cu.cc", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/generate_box_proposals_op.cu.cc at master \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NPRKELoFpRdDb430mqDWncPf4u4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-6x99-gv2v-q76v", "ref_desc": "FPE in `tf.image.generate_bounding_box_proposals` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
