{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39387", "Description": "XWiki OIDC has various tools to manipulate OpenID Connect protocol in XWiki. Prior to version 1.29.1, even if a wiki has an OpenID provider configured through its xwiki.properties, it is possible to provide a third party provider its details through request parameters. One can then bypass the XWiki authentication altogether by specifying its own provider through the oidc.endpoint.* request parameters (or by using an XWiki-based OpenID provider with oidc.xwikiprovider. With the same approach, one could also provide a specific group mapping through oidc.groups.mapping that would make his user automatically part of the XWikiAdminGroup. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to 1.29.1. There is no workaround, an upgrade of the authenticator is required.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39387", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbOpenid ConnectVersions  before (<) 1.29.1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:openid_connect:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.11%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-05-27  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-16  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-07  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-11-11  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-10-05  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/oidc/commit/0247af1417925b9734ab106ad7cd934ee870ac89", "ref_desc": "OIDC-118: Fix bad handling of request parameters \u00b7 xwiki-contrib/oidc@0247af1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/OIDC-118", "ref_desc": "[OIDC-118] It is possible to bypass OpenID login by providing a custom provider - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/oidc/security/advisories/GHSA-m7gv-v8xx-v47w", "ref_desc": "It is possible to bypass OpenID login by providing a custom provider \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki-contrib/oidc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
