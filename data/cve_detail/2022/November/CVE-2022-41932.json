{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41932", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make XWiki create many new schemas and fill them with tables just by using a crafted user identifier in the login form. This may lead to degraded database performance. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.8, 14.6RC1 and 14.4.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41932", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  before (<) 13.10.8cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0.0andbefore (<) 14.4.2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.5.0andbefore (<) 14.6cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:14.4.3cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:14.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:14.4.4cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:14.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-06-15  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-05-05  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-10-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-4x5r-6v26-7j4v", "ref_desc": "Creation of new database tables through login form on PostgreSQL \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19886", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19886] Brute Force Attack - XWikiLogin is executing create table statements on PostgreSQL - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
