{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39386", "Description": "@fastify/websocket provides WebSocket support for Fastify. Any application using @fastify/websocket could crash if a specific, malformed packet is sent. All versions of fastify-websocket are also impacted. That module is deprecated, so it will not be patched. This has been patched in version 7.1.1 (fastify v4) and version 5.0.1 (fastify v3). There are currently no known workarounds. However, it should be possible to attach the error handler manually. The recommended path is upgrading to the patched versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39386", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFastify\u00bbWebsocket\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 7.1.1cpe:2.3:a:fastify:websocket:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nFastify\u00bbWebsocket\u00bbVersion:5.0.0ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:fastify:websocket:5.0.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-31  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-15  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-09  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-websocket/security/advisories/GHSA-4pcg-wr6c-h9cq", "ref_desc": "Crash on malformed packet \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fastify/fastify-websocket \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
