{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41942", "Description": "Sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform. In versions prior to 4.1.0 a command Injection vulnerability existed in the gitserver service, present in all Sourcegraph deployments. This vulnerability was caused by a lack of input validation on the host parameter of the `/list-gitolite` endpoint. It was possible to send a crafted request to gitserver that would execute commands inside the container. Successful exploitation requires the ability to send local requests to gitserver. The issue is patched in version 4.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41942", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSourcegraph\u00bbSourcegraphVersions  before (<) 4.1.0cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:sourcegraph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-14  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.04%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/42553", "ref_desc": "Add hostname validation by evict \u00b7 Pull Request #42553 \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-pfm3-23mh-6xjp", "ref_desc": "Command Injection in gitserver \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
