{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41911", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When printing a tensor, we get it's data as a `const char*` array (since that's the underlying storage) and then we typecast it to the element type. However, conversions from `char` to `bool` are undefined if the `char` is not `0` or `1`, so sanitizers/fuzzers will crash. The issue has been patched in GitHub commit `1be74370327`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, TensorFlow 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41911", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.10.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-09  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-21  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-25  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-704 Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/704/Incorrect-Type-Conversion-or-Cast.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/807cae8a807960fd7ac2313cde73a11fc15e7942/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.cc#L1200-L1227", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-pf36-r9c6-h97j", "ref_desc": "Invalid char to bool conversion when printing a tensor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1be743703279782a357adbf9b77dcb994fe8b508", "ref_desc": "Resolve a sanitizer issue with invalid char -> bool conversion. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@1be7437 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
