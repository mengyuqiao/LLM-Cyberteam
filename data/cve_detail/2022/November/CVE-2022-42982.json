{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-42982", "Description": "BKG Professional NtripCaster 2.0.39 allows querying information over the UDP protocol without authentication. The NTRIP sourcetable is typically quite long (tens of kBs) and can be requested with a packet of only 30 bytes. This presents a vector that can be used for UDP amplification attacks. Normally, only authenticated streaming data will be provided over UDP and not the sourcetable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42982", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBund\u00bbBkg Professional NtripcasterVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.39cpe:2.3:a:bund:bkg_professional_ntripcaster:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-06-09  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-29  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-19  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-23  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-10-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cve.mahi.be/bkg_ntrip_udp/", "ref_desc": "MAHI BV - CVE Portal - CVE-2022-42982 - NTRIP UDP Amplification VectorThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/bkgcaster", "ref_desc": "BKG Professional NtripCasterProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NVqi-dL4O56ghZcXk_yNaijH2Y4.html"}]}
