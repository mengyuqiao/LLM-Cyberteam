{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-37866", "Description": "When Apache Ivy downloads artifacts from a repository it stores them in the local file system based on a user-supplied \"pattern\" that may include placeholders for artifacts coordinates like the organisation, module or version. If said coordinates contain \"../\" sequences - which are valid characters for Ivy coordinates in general - it is possible the artifacts are stored outside of Ivy's local cache or repository or can overwrite different artifacts inside of the local cache. In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs collaboration by the remote repository as Ivy will issue http requests containing \"..\" sequences and a \"normal\" repository will not interpret them as part of the artifact coordinates. Users of Apache Ivy 2.0.0 to 2.5.1 should upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37866", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbIVYVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.5.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:ivy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-11-03  0.17%  0.12%  -0.05 \n 3  2023-12-10  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-14  0.04%  0.16%  +0.11 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 \n 6  2023-02-22  4.50%  0.89%  -3.61 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDIFDL5WSBEKBUVKTABUFDDD25SBNJLS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: apache-ivy-2.5.1-3.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gKSmmMblLOHyc4f8TQhe8_DPjaw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/htxbr8oc464hxrgroftnz3my70whk93b", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-37866: Apache Ivy: Ivy Path traversal-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
