{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39393", "Description": "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator where when a linear memory is reused for another instance the initial heap snapshot of the prior instance can be visible, erroneously to the next instance. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. Other mitigations include disabling the pooling allocator and disabling the `memory-init-cow`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39393", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.2cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 1.0.2cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-02  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-22  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-13  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-17  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-10-11  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/212/Improper-Removal-of-Sensitive-Information-Before-Storage-or-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-226 Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/226/Sensitive-Information-in-Resource-Not-Removed-Before-Reuse.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/2614f2e9d2d36805ead8a8da0fa0c6e0d9e428a0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wh6w-3828-g9qf \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime@2614f2e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-wh6w-3828-g9qf", "ref_desc": "Data leakage between instances in the pooling allocator \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
