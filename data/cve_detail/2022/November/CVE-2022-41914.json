{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41914", "Description": "Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. For organizations with System for Cross-domain Identity Management(SCIM) account management enabled, Zulip Server 5.0 through 5.6 checked the SCIM bearer token using a comparator that did not run in constant time. Therefore, it might theoretically be possible for an attacker to infer the value of the token by performing a sophisticated timing analysis on a large number of failing requests. If successful, this would allow the attacker to impersonate the SCIM client for its abilities to read and update user accounts in the Zulip organization. Organizations where SCIM account management has not been enabled are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41914", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulip ServerVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.7cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-08  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-19  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-q5gx-377v-w76f", "ref_desc": "Non-constant-time SCIM token comparison in Zulip Server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/59edbfa4113d140d3e20126bc65f4d67b2a8ffe5", "ref_desc": "scim: Check SCIM tokens using constant-time comparison. \u00b7 zulip/zulip@59edbfa \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
