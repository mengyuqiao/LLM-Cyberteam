{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36111", "Description": "immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. In versions prior to 1.4.1, a malicious immudb server can provide a falsified proof that will be accepted by the client SDK signing a falsified transaction replacing the genuine one. This situation can not be triggered by a genuine immudb server and requires the client to perform a specific list of verified operations resulting in acceptance of an invalid state value. This vulnerability only affects immudb client SDKs, the immudb server itself is not affected by this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36111", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCodenotary\u00bbImmudbVersions  before (<) 1.4.1cpe:2.3:a:codenotary:immudb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-06-15  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-05  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-26  0.14%  0.11%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-11-30  0.06%  0.14%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-10-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases/tag/v1.4.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.4.1 \u00b7 codenotary/immudb \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2a-EtvtOmWDd-9sk15J8LhLlQt4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/codenotary/immudb/pkg/client", "ref_desc": "client package - github.com/codenotary/immudb/pkg/client - Go PackagesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/tree/master/docs/security/vulnerabilities/linear-fake", "ref_desc": "immudb/docs/security/vulnerabilities/linear-fake at master \u00b7 codenotary/immudb \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/security/advisories/GHSA-672p-m5jq-mrh8", "ref_desc": "Insufficient Verification of Proofs generated by the immudb server in client SDK. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codenotary/immudb \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
