{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39334", "Description": "Nextcloud also ships a CLI utility called nextcloudcmd which is sometimes used for automated scripting and headless servers. Versions of nextcloudcmd prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates, which may enable a Man-in-the-middle attack that exposes sensitive data or credentials to a network attacker. This affects the CLI only. It does not affect the standard GUI desktop Nextcloud clients, and it does not affect the Nextcloud server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39334", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbDesktopVersions  before (<) 3.6.1cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/4927", "ref_desc": "[Bug]: nextcloudcmd incorrectly trusts bad TLS certs \u00b7 Issue #4927 \u00b7 nextcloud/desktop \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-82xx-98xv-4jxv", "ref_desc": "nextcloudcmd incorrectly trusts bad TLS certificates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1699740", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/5022", "ref_desc": "Command-line client.
