{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-43989", "Description": "Password recovery vulnerability in SICK SIM2x00 (ARM) Partnumber 1092673 and 1081902 with firmware version < 1.2.0 allows an unprivileged remote attacker to gain access to the userlevel defined as RecoverableUserLevel by invocating the password recovery mechanism method. This leads to an increase in their privileges on the system and thereby affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system. An attacker can expect repeatable success by exploiting the vulnerability. The recommended solution is to update the firmware to a version >= 1.2.0 as soon as possible (available in SICK Support Portal).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43989", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSick\u00bbSim2000-2p04g10 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:o:sick:sim2000-2p04g10_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Sick\u00bbSim2000-2p04g10\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSick\u00bbSim2500-2p03g10 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:o:sick:sim2500-2p03g10_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Sick\u00bbSim2500-2p03g10\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-24  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-13  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-10-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sick.com/psirt", "ref_desc": "The SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT) | SICKVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v6inTk1Bf2cm1HoZcfS_iK5G0TQ.html"}]}
