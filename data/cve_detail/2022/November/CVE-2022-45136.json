{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-45136", "Description": "Apache Jena SDB 3.17.0 and earlier is vulnerable to a JDBC Deserialisation attack if the attacker is able to control the JDBC URL used or cause the underlying database server to return malicious data. The mySQL JDBC driver in particular is known to be vulnerable to this class of attack. As a result an application using Apache Jena SDB can be subject to RCE when connected to a malicious database server. Apache Jena SDB has been EOL since December 2020 and users should migrate to alternative options e.g. Apache Jena TDB 2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45136", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbJena SdbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.17.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:jena_sdb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.76%  4.08%  -0.68 \n 2  2024-10-13  4.63%  4.76%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-06-06  6.38%  4.63%  -1.75 \n 4  2024-04-26  4.61%  6.38%  +1.77 \n 5  2024-04-13  4.48%  4.61%  +0.13 \n 6  2023-12-17  5.87%  4.48%  -1.38 \n 7  2023-11-21  5.42%  5.87%  +0.44 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  5.42%  +4.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/14/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2022-45136: JDBC Deserialisation in Apache Jena SDBMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/mc77cdl5stgjtjoldk467gdf756qjt31", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-45136: JDBC Deserialisation in Apache Jena SDB-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
