{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41917", "Description": "OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana. OpenSearch allows users to specify a local file when defining text analyzers to process data for text analysis. An issue in the implementation of this feature allows certain specially crafted queries to return a response containing the first line of text from arbitrary files. The list of potentially impacted files is limited to text files with read permissions allowed in the Java Security Manager policy configuration. OpenSearch version 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41917", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearchVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.3.7cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearchVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-16  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/security/advisories/GHSA-w3rx-m34v-wrqx", "ref_desc": "Incorrect Error Handling Allowed Partial File Reads Over REST API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/OpenSearch \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/commit/6d20423f5920745463b1abc5f1daf6a786c41aa0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-w3rx-m34v-wrqx \u00b7 opensearch-project/OpenSearch@6d20423 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
