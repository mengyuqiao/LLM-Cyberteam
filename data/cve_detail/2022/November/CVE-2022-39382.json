{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39382", "Description": "Keystone is a headless CMS for Node.js \u2014 built with GraphQL and React.`@keystone-6/core@3.0.0 || 3.0.1` users that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger security-sensitive functionality in their production builds are vulnerable to `NODE_ENV` being inlined to `\"development\"` for user code, irrespective of what your environment variables. If you do not use `NODE_ENV` in your user code to trigger security-sensitive functionality, you are not impacted by this vulnerability. Any dependencies that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviors (optimizations, security or otherwise) should still respect your environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable. The application's dependencies, as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`), are typically not compiled as part of this process, and thus should be unaffected. We have tested this assumption by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies when using `statelessSessions`. This vulnerability has been fixed in @keystone-6/core@3.0.2, regression tests have been added for this vulnerability in #8063.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39382", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKeystonejs\u00bbKeystone\u00bbVersion:3.0.0ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nKeystonejs\u00bbKeystone\u00bbVersion:3.0.1ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.22%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-06-24  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-10  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-05-26  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-15  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-12-06  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-11-10  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-10-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8063", "ref_desc": "Test that process.env.NODE_ENV is production when set to that in production by mitchellhamilton \u00b7 Pull Request #8063 \u00b7 keystonejs/keystone \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-25mx-2mxm-6343", "ref_desc": "NODE_ENV defaults to development with esbuild \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 keystonejs/keystone \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8031/", "ref_desc": "Fixes platform configuration for esbuild by mmachatschek \u00b7 Pull Request #8031 \u00b7 keystonejs/keystone \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
