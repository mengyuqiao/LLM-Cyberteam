{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39379", "Description": "Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files, RDBMS, NoSQL, IaaS, SaaS, Hadoop and so on. A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default configurations of Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly set to `object`. Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in Fluentd version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this vulnerability. This issue was patched in version 1.15.3. As a workaround do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39379", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFluentd\u00bbFluentdVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.2andbefore (<) 1.15.3cpe:2.3:a:fluentd:fluentd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-21  2.43%  2.55%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-06-23  1.47%  2.43%  +0.96 \n 3  2024-06-09  1.25%  1.47%  +0.22 \n 4  2024-05-25  1.18%  1.25%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-04-14  1.20%  1.18%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-01-25  1.13%  1.20%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-12-05  0.99%  1.13%  +0.14 \n 8  2023-11-09  0.57%  0.99%  +0.43 \n 9  2023-11-08  0.40%  0.57%  +0.17 \n 10  2023-10-03  0.36%  0.40%  +0.04 \n 11  2023-03-07  5.63%  0.36%  -5.27 \n 12  2023-01-11  1.98%  5.63%  +3.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/security/advisories/GHSA-fppq-mj76-fpj2", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution due to insecure deserialization (in non-default configuration) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fluent/fluentd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MYD5QV66OLDHES6IKVYYM3Y3YID3VVCO/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: golang-github-graylog2-gelf-2.0.0-6.20201111git1550ee6.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/commit/48e5b85dab1b6d4c273090d538fc11b3f2fd8135", "ref_desc": "Remove `object` from the available list of `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` \u00b7 fluent/fluentd@48e5b85 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
