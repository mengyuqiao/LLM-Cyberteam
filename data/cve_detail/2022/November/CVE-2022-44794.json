{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-44794", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. Management protocol has a flow which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary Bash code with root privileges. The command that sets the hostname doesn't validate input parameters. As a result, arbitrary data goes directly to the Bash interpreter. An attacker would need credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-44794", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nObjectfirst\u00bbObject FirstVersions  before (<) 1.0.13.1611cpe:2.3:a:objectfirst:object_first:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.22%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.24%  0.26%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.22%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-30  0.17%  0.22%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-11-13  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-10-07  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-09-13  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.09%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://objectfirst.com/security/of-20221024-0001/", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution vulnerability in Object First - Object FirstVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
