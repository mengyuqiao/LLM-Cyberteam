{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41876", "Description": "ezplatform-graphql is a GraphQL server implementation for Ibexa DXP and Ibexa Open Source. Versions prior to 2.3.12 and 1.0.13 are subject to Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information. Unauthenticated GraphQL queries for user accounts can expose password hashes of users that have created or modified content, typically administrators and editors. This issue has been patched in versions 2.3.12, and 1.0.13 on the 1.X branch. Users unable to upgrade can remove the \"passwordHash\" entry from \"src/bundle/Resources/config/graphql/User.types.yaml\" in the GraphQL package, and other properties like hash type, email, login if you prefer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41876", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nIbexa\u00bbEzplatform-graphqlVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.3.12cpe:2.3:a:ibexa:ezplatform-graphql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIbexa\u00bbEzplatform-graphqlVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.0.13cpe:2.3:a:ibexa:ezplatform-graphql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIbexa\u00bbEzplatform-graphql\u00bbVersion:2.0.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:ibexa:ezplatform-graphql:2.0.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-13  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 5  2023-11-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-922 Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/922/Insecure-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-graphql/security/advisories/GHSA-c7pc-pgf6-mfh5", "ref_desc": "GraphQL queries can expose password hashes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ezsystems/ezplatform-graphql \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
