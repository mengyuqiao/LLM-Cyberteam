{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39338", "Description": "user_oidc is an OpenID Connect user backend for Nextcloud. Versions prior to 1.2.1 did not properly validate discovery urls which may lead to a stored cross site scripting attack vector. The impact is limited due to the restrictive CSP that is applied on this endpoint. Additionally this vulnerability has only been shown to be exploitable in the Safari web browser. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should urge their users to avoid using the Safari web browser.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39338", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbOpenid Connect User Backend\u00bbForNextcloudVersions  before (<) 1.2.1cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:openid_connect_user_backend:*:*:*:*:*:nextcloud:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1687410", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-5fpw-795h-rg57", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via Authorization Endpoint - Safari-Only \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/user_oidc/pull/496", "ref_desc": "Check if authorization_endpoint is valid in code flow by julien-nc \u00b7 Pull Request #496 \u00b7 nextcloud/user_oidc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
