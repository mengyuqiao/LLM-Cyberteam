{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41957", "Description": "Muhammara is a node module with c/cpp bindings to modify PDF with JavaScript for node or electron. The package muhammara before 2.6.2 and from 3.0.0 and before 3.3.0, as well as all versions of muhammara's predecessor package hummus, are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when supplied with a maliciously crafted PDF file to be parsed. The issue has been patched in muhammara version 3.4.0 and the fix has been backported to version 2.6.2. As a workaround, do not process files from untrusted sources. If using hummus, replace the package with muhammara.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41957", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMuhammara Project\u00bbMuhammara\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.3.0cpe:2.3:a:muhammara_project:muhammara:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nMuhammara Project\u00bbMuhammara\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:muhammara_project:muhammara:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nHummus Project\u00bbHummus\u00bbForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:hummus_project:hummus:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-19  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-05  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-20  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-05-10  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-12-31  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-12-05  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-10-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-690 Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/690/Unchecked-Return-Value-to-NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/julianhille/MuhammaraJS/pull/235", "ref_desc": "Feature/finding null pointer by julianhille \u00b7 Pull Request #235 \u00b7 julianhille/MuhammaraJS \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/julianhille/MuhammaraJS/pull/238", "ref_desc": "Hotfix/v2.6.2 by julianhille \u00b7 Pull Request #238 \u00b7 julianhille/MuhammaraJS \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/julianhille/MuhammaraJS/security/advisories/GHSA-2r7v-cmch-5x26", "ref_desc": "Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference in muhammara (and hummus) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 julianhille/MuhammaraJS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
