{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41887", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. `tf.keras.losses.poisson` receives a `y_pred` and `y_true` that are passed through `functor::mul` in `BinaryOp`. If the resulting dimensions overflow an `int32`, TensorFlow will crash due to a size mismatch during broadcast assignment. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c5b30379ba87cbe774b08ac50c1f6d36df4ebb7c. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1 and 2.9.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range. However, we will not cherrypick this commit into TensorFlow 2.8.x, as it depends on Eigen behavior that changed between 2.8 and 2.9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41887", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.10.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-25  0.11%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-12-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-25  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-10-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/131/Incorrect-Calculation-of-Buffer-Size.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c5b30379ba87cbe774b08ac50c1f6d36df4ebb7c", "ref_desc": "Fix cwise dimension overflow issue again. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@c5b3037 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-8fvv-46hw-vpg3", "ref_desc": "Overflow in `tf.keras.losses.poisson` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_ops_common.h", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/cwise_ops_common.h at master \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/losses.py", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
