{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39394", "Description": "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition of the `wasmtime_trap_code` does not match its declared signature in the `wasmtime/trap.h` header file. This discrepancy causes the function implementation to perform a 4-byte write into a 1-byte buffer provided by the caller. This can lead to three zero bytes being written beyond the 1-byte location provided by the caller. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by providing a 4-byte buffer casted to a 1-byte buffer when calling `wasmtime_trap_code`. Users of the `wasmtime` crate are not affected by this issue, only users of the C API function `wasmtime_trap_code` are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39394", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.2cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 1.0.2cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.20%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-06-02  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-22  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-12-13  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-11-17  0.11%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-10-11  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 \n 8  2023-02-22  10.86%  0.89%  -9.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-h84q-m8rr-3v9q", "ref_desc": "Out of bounds write in `wasmtime_trap_code` C API function \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/087d9d7becf7422b3f872a3bcd5d97bb7ce7ff36", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-h84q-m8rr-3v9q \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime@087d9d7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
