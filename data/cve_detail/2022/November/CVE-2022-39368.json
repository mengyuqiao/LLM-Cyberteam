{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39368", "Description": "Eclipse Californium is a Java implementation of RFC7252 - Constrained Application Protocol for IoT Cloud services. In versions prior to 3.7.0, and 2.7.4, Californium is vulnerable to a Denial of Service. Failing handshakes don't cleanup counters for throttling, causing the threshold to be reached without being released again. This results in permanently dropping records. The issue was reported for certificate based handshakes, but may also affect PSK based handshakes. It generally affects client and server as well. This issue is patched in version 3.7.0 and 2.7.4. There are no known workarounds. main: commit 726bac57659410da463dcf404b3e79a7312ac0b9 2.7.x: commit 5648a0c27c2c2667c98419254557a14bac2b1f3f", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39368", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbCaliforniumVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.7.0cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:californium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbCaliforniumVersions  before (<) 2.7.4cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:californium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-30  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 4  2024-04-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-12-12  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-11-05  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-459 Incomplete Cleanup", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/459/Incomplete-Cleanup.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium/commit/5648a0c27c2c2667c98419254557a14bac2b1f3f", "ref_desc": "Run all pending job on removing connections. \u00b7 eclipse-californium/californium@5648a0c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium/commit/726bac57659410da463dcf404b3e79a7312ac0b9", "ref_desc": "Fix pending job counters. \u00b7 eclipse-californium/californium@726bac5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/eclipse-californium/californium/security/advisories/GHSA-p72g-cgh9-ghjg", "ref_desc": "Failing DTLS handshakes may cause throttling to block processing of records \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 eclipse-californium/californium \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
