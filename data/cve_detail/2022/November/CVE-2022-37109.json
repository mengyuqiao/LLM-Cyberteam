{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-37109", "Description": "patrickfuller camp up to and including commit bbd53a256ed70e79bd8758080936afbf6d738767 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. Access to the password.txt file is not properly restricted as it is in the root directory served by StaticFileHandler and the Tornado rule to throw a 403 error when password.txt is accessed can be bypassed. Furthermore, it is not necessary to crack the password hash to authenticate with the application because the password hash is also used as the cookie secret, so an attacker can generate his own authentication cookie.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37109", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCamp Project\u00bbCampVersions  before (<) 2022-07-21cpe:2.3:a:camp_project:camp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.61%  1.33%  -1.28 \n 2  2024-10-29  1.86%  2.61%  +0.75 \n 3  2024-09-02  1.32%  1.86%  +0.54 \n 4  2024-07-05  1.25%  1.32%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-06-21  1.00%  1.25%  +0.25 \n 6  2024-06-06  0.73%  1.00%  +0.28 \n 7  2024-05-24  0.60%  0.73%  +0.13 \n 8  2024-04-26  0.55%  0.60%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-12-17  0.60%  0.55%  -0.05 \n 10  2023-11-21  0.39%  0.60%  +0.21 \n 11  2023-11-08  0.33%  0.39%  +0.05 \n 12  2023-10-15  0.28%  0.33%  +0.05 \n 13  2023-07-08  0.31%  0.28%  -0.03 \n 14  2023-05-08  0.28%  0.31%  +0.03 \n 15  2023-04-27  0.36%  0.28%  -0.08 \n 16  2023-03-28  0.42%  0.36%  -0.05 \n 17  2023-03-26  0.06%  0.42%  +0.35 \n 18  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 \n 19  2023-02-22  12.49%  0.95%  -11.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/@elias.hohl/authentication-bypass-vulnerability-in-camp-a-raspberry-pi-camera-server-477e5d270904", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass vulnerability in camp, a Raspberry Pi camera server | by Elias Hohl | MediumExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patrickfuller/camp/commit/bf6af5c2e5cf713e4050c11c52dd4c55e89880b1", "ref_desc": "Fix vulnerability and add warning \u00b7 patrickfuller/camp@bf6af5c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ehtec/camp-exploit", "ref_desc": "GitHub - ehtec/camp-exploit: Authentication Bypass for https://github.com/patrickfuller/campThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171478/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Server-1.0-Authentication-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "Raspberry Pi Camera Server 1.0 Authentication Bypass \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
