{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-37865", "Description": "With Apache Ivy 2.4.0 an optional packaging attribute has been introduced that allows artifacts to be unpacked on the fly if they used pack200 or zip packaging. For artifacts using the \"zip\", \"jar\" or \"war\" packaging Ivy prior to 2.5.1 doesn't verify the target path when extracting the archive. An archive containing absolute paths or paths that try to traverse \"upwards\" using \"..\" sequences can then write files to any location on the local fie system that the user executing Ivy has write access to. Ivy users of version 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 should upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37865", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbIVYVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.5.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:ivy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-11-03  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 3  2023-12-10  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-14  0.06%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-11-03  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YDIFDL5WSBEKBUVKTABUFDDD25SBNJLS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: apache-ivy-2.5.1-3.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gKSmmMblLOHyc4f8TQhe8_DPjaw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/gqvvv7qsm2dfjg6xzsw1s2h08tbr0sdy", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-37865: Apache Ivy allow create/overwrite any file on the system-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
