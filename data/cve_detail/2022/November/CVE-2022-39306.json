{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39306", "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions prior to 9.2.4, or 8.5.15 on the 8.X branch, are subject to Improper Input Validation. Grafana admins can invite other members to the organization they are an admin for. When admins add members to the organization, non existing users get an email invite, existing members are added directly to the organization. When an invite link is sent, it allows users to sign up with whatever username/email address the user chooses and become a member of the organization. This introduces a vulnerability which can be used with malicious intent. This issue is patched in version 9.2.4, and has been backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39306", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.5.15cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.2.4cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-01  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-21  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-12  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-16  0.10%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-10-10  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-2x6g-h2hg-rq84", "ref_desc": "Email addresses and usernames can not be trusted \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221215-0004/", "ref_desc": "November 2022 Grafana Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RvyWU5pdfj4QG5t9CQWWRDdqNlk.html"}]}
