{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41904", "Description": "Element iOS is an iOS Matrix client provided by Element. It is based on MatrixSDK. Prior to version 1.9.7, events encrypted using Megolm for which trust could not be established did not get decorated accordingly (with warning shields). Therefore a malicious homeserver could inject messages into the room without the user being alerted that the messages were not sent by a verified group member, even if the user has previously verified all group members. This issue has been patched in Element iOS 1.9.7. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41904", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElement\u00bbElement\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 1.9.7cpe:2.3:a:element:element:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-23  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-357 Insufficient UI Warning of Dangerous Operations", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/357/Insufficient-UI-Warning-of-Dangerous-Operations.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/releases/tag/v1.9.7", "ref_desc": "Release v1.9.7 \u00b7 vector-im/element-ios \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/security/advisories/GHSA-fm8m-99j7-323g", "ref_desc": "Missing decoration for events decrypted with untrusted Megolm sessions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vector-im/element-ios \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
