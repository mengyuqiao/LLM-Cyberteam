{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41894", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The reference kernel of the `CONV_3D_TRANSPOSE` TensorFlow Lite operator wrongly increments the data_ptr when adding the bias to the result. Instead of `data_ptr += num_channels;` it should be `data_ptr += output_num_channels;` as if the number of input channels is different than the number of output channels, the wrong result will be returned and a buffer overflow will occur if num_channels > output_num_channels. An attacker can craft a model with a specific number of input channels. It is then possible to write specific values through the bias of the layer outside the bounds of the buffer. This attack only works if the reference kernel resolver is used in the interpreter. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 72c0bdcb25305b0b36842d746cc61d72658d2941. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41894", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.10.0andbefore (<) 2.10.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.8.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.12%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-25  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-30  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 6  2023-12-21  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-25  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-10-19  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-h6q3-vv32-2cq5", "ref_desc": "Buffer overflow in `CONV_3D_TRANSPOSE` on TFLite \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/091e63f0ea33def7ecad661a5ac01dcafbafa90b/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/conv3d_transpose.h#L121", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/conv3d_transpose.h at 091e63f0ea33def7ecad661a5ac01dcafbafa90b \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/72c0bdcb25305b0b36842d746cc61d72658d2941", "ref_desc": "Fix a potential buffer overflow issue in reference kernel of the CONV\u2026 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@72c0bdc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
