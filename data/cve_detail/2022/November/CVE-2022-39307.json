{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39307", "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is made to the `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL. When the username or email does not exist, a JSON response contains a \u201cuser not found\u201d message. This leaks information to unauthenticated users and introduces a security risk. This issue has been patched in 9.2.4 and backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39307", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.2.4cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  before (<) 8.5.15cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-04-21  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-3p62-42x7-gxg5", "ref_desc": "User enumeration via forget password \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221215-0004/", "ref_desc": "November 2022 Grafana Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RvyWU5pdfj4QG5t9CQWWRDdqNlk.html"}]}
