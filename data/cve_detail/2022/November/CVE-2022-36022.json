{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36022", "Description": "Deeplearning4J is a suite of tools for deploying and training deep learning models using the JVM. Packages org.deeplearning4j:dl4j-examples and org.deeplearning4j:platform-tests through version 1.0.0-M2.1 may use some unclaimed S3 buckets in tests in examples. This is likely affect people who use some older NLP examples that reference an old S3 bucket. The problem has been patched. Users should upgrade to snapshots as Deeplearning4J plan to publish a release with the fix at a later date. As a workaround, download a word2vec google news vector from a new source using git lfs from here.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36022", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbDeeplearning4jVersions  before (<) 1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:deeplearning4j:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbDeeplearning4j\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateMilestone1cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:deeplearning4j:1.0.0:milestone1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbDeeplearning4j\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateMilestone1.1cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:deeplearning4j:1.0.0:milestone1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbDeeplearning4j\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateMilestone2cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:deeplearning4j:1.0.0:milestone2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbDeeplearning4j\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateBeta6cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:deeplearning4j:1.0.0:beta6:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbDeeplearning4j\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateBeta7cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:deeplearning4j:1.0.0:beta7:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbDeeplearning4j\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateBeta5cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:deeplearning4j:1.0.0:beta5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-13  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-06  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-344 Use of Invariant Value in Dynamically Changing Context", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/344/Use-of-Invariant-Value-in-Dynamically-Changing-Context.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/security/advisories/GHSA-rc39-g977-687w", "ref_desc": "Use of unclaimed s3 bucket in tests and examples \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors", "ref_desc": "GitHub - mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors: word2vec Google News modelThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
