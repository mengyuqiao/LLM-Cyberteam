{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39352", "Description": "OpenFGA is a high-performance authorization/permission engine inspired by Google Zanzibar. Versions prior to 0.2.5 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. You are affected by this vulnerability if you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statement). This issue has been patched in version v0.2.5. This update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39352", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenfga\u00bbOpenfgaVersions  before (<) 0.2.5cpe:2.3:a:openfga:openfga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.19%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-31  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-20  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-11-15  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-10-09  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-3gfj-fxx4-f22w", "ref_desc": "OpenFGA Authorization Bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openfga/openfga \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
