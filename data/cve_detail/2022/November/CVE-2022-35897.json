{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35897", "Description": "An stack buffer overflow vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution issue was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. If the attacker modifies specific UEFI variables, it can cause a stack overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution. The specific variables are normally locked (read-only) at the OS level and therefore an attack would require direct SPI modification. If an attacker can change the values of at least two variables out of three (SecureBootEnforce, SecureBoot, RestoreBootSettings), it is possible to execute arbitrary code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35897", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nInsyde\u00bbKernelVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.5cpe:2.3:o:insyde:kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-13  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-03  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-24  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.06%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.insyde.com/security-pledge/SA-2022041", "ref_desc": "Insyde Security Advisory 2022041 | Insyde SoftwareVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.insyde.com/security-pledge", "ref_desc": "Insyde's Security Pledge | Insyde SoftwareVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ib69XaDxtR6lbqvbe6j25hD0kuk.html"}]}
