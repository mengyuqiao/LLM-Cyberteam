{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41939", "Description": "knative.dev/func is is a client library and CLI enabling the development and deployment of Kubernetes functions. Developers using a malicious or compromised third-party buildpack could expose their registry credentials or local docker socket to a malicious `lifecycle` container. This issues has been patched in PR #1442, and is part of release 1.8.1. This issue only affects users who are using function buildpacks from third-parties; pinning the builder image to a specific content-hash with a valid `lifecycle` image will also mitigate the attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41939", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKnative FuncVersions  before (<) 1.8.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:knative_func:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-11  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 3  2024-05-01  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-25  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-10-19  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/knative/func/pull/1442", "ref_desc": "fix(GHSA-5336-2g3f-9g3m): Fixes GSA GHSA-5336-2g3f-9g3m by lance \u00b7 Pull Request #1442 \u00b7 knative/func \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/knative/func/blob/5ca77d38744d3481cc0b795f607c5859b19588fc/buildpacks/builder.go#L37-L41", "ref_desc": "func/builder.go at 5ca77d38744d3481cc0b795f607c5859b19588fc \u00b7 knative/func \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/knative/func/releases/tag/knative-v1.8.1", "ref_desc": "Release Knative Func release v1.8.1 \u00b7 knative/func \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/knative/func/security/advisories/GHSA-5336-2g3f-9g3m", "ref_desc": "Potential local compromise when running third-party builders \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 knative/func \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
