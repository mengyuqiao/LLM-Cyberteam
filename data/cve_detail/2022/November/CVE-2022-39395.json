{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39395", "Description": "Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. In Vela Server and Vela Worker prior to version 0.16.0 and Vela UI prior to version 0.17.0, some default configurations for Vela allow exploitation and container breakouts. Users should upgrade to Server 0.16.0, Worker 0.16.0, and UI 0.17.0 to fix the issue. After upgrading, Vela administrators will need to explicitly change the default settings to configure Vela as desired. Some of the fixes will interrupt existing workflows and will require Vela administrators to modify default settings. However, not applying the patch (or workarounds) will continue existing risk exposure. Some workarounds are available. Vela administrators can adjust the worker's `VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES` setting to be explicitly empty, leverage the `VELA_REPO_ALLOWLIST` setting on the server component to restrict access to a list of repositories that are allowed to be enabled, and/or audit enabled repositories and disable pull_requests if they are not needed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39395", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGo-vela\u00bbUIVersions  before (<) 0.17.0cpe:2.3:a:go-vela:ui:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGo-vela\u00bbWorkerVersions  before (<) 0.16.0cpe:2.3:a:go-vela:worker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGo-vela\u00bbServerVersions  before (<) 0.16.0cpe:2.3:a:go-vela:server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.34%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.21%  0.26%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-06-17  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-06-02  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-17  0.13%  0.19%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-10-11  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.28%  0.11%  -1.17 \n 8  2023-02-22  16.20%  1.28%  -14.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://go-vela.github.io/docs/installation/server/reference/#vela_repo_allowlist", "ref_desc": "Reference | VelaVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/server/releases/tag/v0.16.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.16.0 \u00b7 go-vela/server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/worker/security/advisories/GHSA-2w78-ffv6-p46w", "ref_desc": "Insecure Defaults \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 go-vela/worker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/ui/releases/tag/v0.17.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.17.0 \u00b7 go-vela/ui \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/worker/releases/tag/v0.16.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.16.0 \u00b7 go-vela/worker \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://go-vela.github.io/docs/installation/worker/reference/#vela_runtime_privileged_images", "ref_desc": "Reference | VelaVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface", "ref_desc": "Docker security | Docker DocumentationTechnical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/server/security/advisories/GHSA-5m7g-pj8w-7593", "ref_desc": "Insecure Defaults \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 go-vela/server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/ui/security/advisories/GHSA-xf39-98m2-889v", "ref_desc": "Insecure Defaults \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 go-vela/ui \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/05558ee99d70f7d6f83bed7c8f78ac0b35fa26f4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5m7g-pj8w-7593 \u00b7 go-vela/server@05558ee \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
