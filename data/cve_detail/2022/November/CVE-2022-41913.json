{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41913", "Description": "Discourse-calendar is a plugin for the Discourse messaging platform which adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic. Members of private groups or public groups with private members can be listed by users, who can create and edit post events. This vulnerability only affects sites which have discourse post events enabled. This issue has been patched in commit `ca5ae3e7e` which will be included in future releases. Users unable to upgrade should disable the `discourse_post_event_enabled` setting to fully mitigate the issue. Also, it's possible to prevent regular users from using this vulnerability by removing all groups from the `discourse_post_event_allowed_on_groups` but note that moderators will still be able to use it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41913", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbCalendar\u00bbVersion:0.2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:calendar:0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/commit/ca5ae3e7e0c2b32af5ca4ec69c95e95b2ecef2e9", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Do not expose private group members (#345) \u00b7 discourse/discourse-calendar@ca5ae3e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/security/advisories/GHSA-jh96-w279-g7r9", "ref_desc": "Discourse-calendar exposes members of hidden groups \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-calendar \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
