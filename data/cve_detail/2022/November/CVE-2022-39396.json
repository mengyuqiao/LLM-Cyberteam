{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39396", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 4.10.18, and prior to 5.3.1 on the 5.X branch, are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via prototype pollution. An attacker can use this prototype pollution sink to trigger a remote code execution through the MongoDB BSON parser. This issue is patched in version 5.3.1 and in 4.10.18. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39396", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.10.18cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.3.1cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.50%  0.35%  -0.15 \n 2  2024-10-25  0.46%  0.50%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-17  0.44%  0.46%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-02  0.41%  0.44%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-04-22  0.46%  0.41%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-12-12  0.49%  0.46%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-11-16  0.84%  0.49%  -0.35 \n 8  2023-10-10  0.72%  0.84%  +0.12 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.72%  -0.43 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-prm5-8g2m-24gg", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution via MongoDB BSON parser through prototype pollution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
