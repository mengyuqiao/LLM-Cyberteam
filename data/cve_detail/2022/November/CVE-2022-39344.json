{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39344", "Description": "Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, that is fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. Prior to version 6.1.12, the USB DFU UPLOAD functionality may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function prevents buffer overflow during handling of DFU UPLOAD command when current state is `UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_IDLE`. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 6.1.12. As a workaround, add the `UPLOAD_LENGTH` check in all possible states.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39344", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbAzure Rtos UsbxVersions  before (<) 6.1.12cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:azure_rtos_usbx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.44%  0.30%  -0.14 \n 2  2024-05-27  0.44%  0.44%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-16  0.43%  0.44%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-14  0.43%  0.43%  0.00 \n 5  2023-12-07  0.36%  0.43%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-11-11  0.30%  0.36%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-10-05  0.28%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-09-11  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-08-31  0.28%  0.23%  -0.05 \n 10  2023-05-12  0.27%  0.28%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-04-17  0.36%  0.27%  -0.09 \n 12  2023-04-09  0.23%  0.36%  +0.14 \n 13  2023-03-16  0.25%  0.23%  -0.03 \n 14  2023-03-07  1.60%  0.25%  -1.35 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/security/advisories/GHSA-m9p8-xrp7-vvqp", "ref_desc": "DFU UPLOAD buffer overflow revised \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 azure-rtos/usbx \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
