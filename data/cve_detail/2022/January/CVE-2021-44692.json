{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44692", "Description": "BuddyBoss Platform through 1.8.0 allows remote attackers to obtain the email address of each user. When creating a new user, it generates a Unique ID for their profile. This UID is their private email address with symbols removed and periods replaced with hyphens. For example. JohnDoe@example.com would become /members/johndoeexample-com and Jo.test@example.com would become /members/jo-testexample-com. The members list is available to everyone and (in a default configuration) often without authentication. It is therefore trivial to collect a list of email addresses.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44692", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nBuddyboss\u00bbBuddybossVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.8.0cpe:2.3:a:buddyboss:buddyboss:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.11%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-10-11  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-01  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-19  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-09  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cygenta.co.uk/post/buddyboss", "ref_desc": "Notes from a Pentester: How we found 2 new BuddyBoss vulnerabilitiesMitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/u9N40-c-5xZav5-QDOFoku2Adqk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.buddyboss.com/resources/buddyboss-platform-releases/", "ref_desc": "Platform Release Notes | BuddyBoss ResourcesRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vfLLJ2kcuua_OD_DIqMBCiNLmXQ.html"}]}
