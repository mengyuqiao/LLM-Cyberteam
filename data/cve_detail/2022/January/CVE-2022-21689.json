{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21689", "Description": "OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions the receive mode limits concurrent uploads to 100 per second and blocks other uploads in the same second, which can be triggered by a simple script. An adversary with access to the receive mode can block file upload for others. There is no way to block this attack in public mode due to the anonymity properties of the tor network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21689", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOnionshare\u00bbOnionshareVersions  before (<) 2.5cpe:2.3:a:onionshare:onionshare:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-03  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-11  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/releases/tag/v2.5", "ref_desc": "Release OnionShare 2.5 \u00b7 onionshare/onionshare \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Mv_ifDy4NsAMcyDKDF5TMzqWqeI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/security/advisories/GHSA-jh82-c5jw-pxpc", "ref_desc": "OTF-012: Denial of Service: The receive mode limits concurrent uploads to 100 per second and blocks other uploads in the same second, which can be triggered by a simple script \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 onionshare/Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
