{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44981", "Description": "In QuickBox Pro v2.5.8 and below, the config.php file has a variable which takes a GET parameter value and parses it into a shell_exec(''); function without properly sanitizing any shell arguments, therefore remote code execution is possible. Additionally, as the media server is running as root by default attackers can use the sudo command within this shell_exec(''); function, which allows for privilege escalation by means of RCE.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44981", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nQuickbox\u00bbQuickbox\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.8cpe:2.3:a:quickbox:quickbox:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nQuickbox\u00bbQuickbox\u00bb     PROEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.8cpe:2.3:a:quickbox:quickbox:*:*:*:*:pro:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.67%  1.20%  +0.53 \n 2  2024-07-08  0.65%  0.67%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-02  0.53%  0.65%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-02-07  0.63%  0.53%  -0.10 \n 5  2024-01-21  0.46%  0.63%  +0.17 \n 6  2024-01-09  0.45%  0.46%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-10-29  0.33%  0.45%  +0.12 \n 8  2023-10-15  0.33%  0.33%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-09-15  0.33%  0.33%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-08-17  0.33%  0.33%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-07-20  0.43%  0.33%  -0.10 \n 12  2023-06-10  0.37%  0.43%  +0.06 \n 13  2023-05-14  0.38%  0.37%  -0.01 \n 14  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.38%  -1.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/QuickBox/QB/issues/202", "ref_desc": "Responsible disclosure policy \u00b7 Issue #202 \u00b7 QuickBox/QB \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://websec.nl/blog/61b2b37a43a1155c848f3b08/websec%20finds%20critical%20vulnerabilities%20in%20popular%20media%20server", "ref_desc": "Developing a Remote Code Execution exploit for a popular media boxExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
