{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20658", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Management Portal (Unified CCMP) and Cisco Unified Contact Center Domain Manager (Unified CCDM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate their privileges to Administrator. This vulnerability is due to the lack of server-side validation of user permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create Administrator accounts. With these accounts, the attacker could access and modify telephony and user resources across all the Unified platforms that are associated to the vulnerable Cisco Unified CCMP. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Advanced User credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20658", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Contact Center Express\u00bbVersion:12.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Contact Center Express\u00bbVersion:12.5.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Contact Center Management PortalVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.6.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_management_portal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-06  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2023-08-22  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2023-08-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-602 Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/602/Client-Side-Enforcement-of-Server-Side-Security.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-669 Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/669/Incorrect-Resource-Transfer-Between-Spheres.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ccmp-priv-esc-JzhTFLm4", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Contact Center Management Portal and Unified Contact Center Domain Manager Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
