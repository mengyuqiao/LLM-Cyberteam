{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21707", "Description": "wasmCloud Host Runtime is a server process that securely hosts and provides dispatch for web assembly (WASM) actors and capability providers. In versions prior to 0.52.2 actors can bypass capability authorization. Actors are normally required to declare their capabilities for inbound invocations, but with this vulnerability actor capability claims are not verified upon receiving invocations. This compromises the security model for actors as they can receive unauthorized invocations from linked capability providers. The problem has been patched in versions `0.52.2` and greater. There is no workaround and users are advised to upgrade to an unaffected version as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21707", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWasmcloud\u00bbHost RuntimeVersions  before (<) 0.52.2cpe:2.3:a:wasmcloud:host_runtime:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-14  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-04  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp/commit/fd07262074b98b06106a31fd1957dc2319d438a5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2cmx-rr54-88g5 \u00b7 wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp@fd07262 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp/security/advisories/GHSA-2cmx-rr54-88g5", "ref_desc": "wasmCloud actors without signed capabilities can receive unauthorized invocations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
