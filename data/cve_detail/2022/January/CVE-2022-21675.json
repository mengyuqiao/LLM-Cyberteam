{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21675", "Description": "Bytecode Viewer (BCV) is a Java/Android reverse engineering suite. Versions of the package prior to 2.11.0 are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA \"Zip Slip\"). The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.exe). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including zip, jar, tar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s machine. The impact of a Zip Slip vulnerability would allow an attacker to create or overwrite existing files on the filesystem. In the context of a web application, a web shell could be placed within the application directory to achieve code execution. All users should upgrade to BCV v2.11.0 when possible to receive a patch. There are no recommended workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21675", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nBytecode Viewer Project\u00bbBytecode ViewerVersions  from including (>=) 2.10.16andbefore (<) 2.11.0cpe:2.3:a:bytecode_viewer_project:bytecode_viewer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.60%  0.52%  -0.09 \n 2  2024-09-27  0.53%  0.60%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-08-18  0.47%  0.53%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-07-23  0.39%  0.47%  +0.08 \n 5  2024-05-30  0.56%  0.39%  -0.17 \n 6  2023-09-03  0.33%  0.56%  +0.23 \n 7  2023-08-20  0.28%  0.33%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-06-25  0.20%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 9  2023-03-07  4.84%  0.20%  -4.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer/releases/tag/v2.11.0", "ref_desc": "Release 2.11.0 - Security Update \u00b7 Konloch/bytecode-viewer \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer/commit/1ec02658fe6858162f5e6a24f97928de6696c5cb", "ref_desc": "Improve Zip Slip detection \u00b7 Konloch/bytecode-viewer@1ec0265 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer/security/advisories/GHSA-3wq9-j4fc-4wmc", "ref_desc": "Bytecode Viewer v2.10.x Zip Slip \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Konloch/bytecode-viewer \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer/commit/c968e94b2c93da434a4ecfac6d08eda162d615d0", "ref_desc": "Mitigate Zip Slip exlpoit \u00b7 Konloch/bytecode-viewer@c968e94 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
