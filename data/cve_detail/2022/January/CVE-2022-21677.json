{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21677", "Description": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Discourse groups can be configured with varying visibility levels for the group as well as the group members. By default, a newly created group has its visibility set to public and the group's members visibility set to public as well. However, a group's visibility and the group's members visibility can be configured such that it is restricted to logged on users, members of the group or staff users. A vulnerability has been discovered in versions prior to 2.7.13 and 2.8.0.beta11 where the group advanced search option does not respect the group's visibility and members visibility level. As such, a group with restricted visibility or members visibility can be revealed through search with the right search option. This issue is patched in `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11 versions of Discourse. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21677", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.7.12cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta4cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta5cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta6cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta6:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta7cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta7:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta10cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta10:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta8cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta8:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta9cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta9:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-29  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-20  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-07  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-27  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/fff8b98485561b12d070c0a8c39f4e503813ab44", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Advanced group search did not respect visiblity of groups. \u00b7 discourse/discourse@fff8b98 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-768r-ppv4-5r27", "ref_desc": "Group advanced search option may leak group and group's members visibility \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
