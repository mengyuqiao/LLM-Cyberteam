{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21681", "Description": "Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21681", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMarked Project\u00bbMarked\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.0.10cpe:2.3:a:marked_project:marked:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.20%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-29  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-20  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-09-05  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-08-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-06-27  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/8f806573a3f6c6b7a39b8cdb66ab5ebb8d55a5f5", "ref_desc": "fix(security): fix redos vulnerabilities \u00b7 markedjs/marked@8f80657 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-5v2h-r2cx-5xgj", "ref_desc": "Exponential catastrophic backtracking (ReDoS) in `inline.reflinkSearch` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 markedjs/marked \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AIXDMC3CSHYW3YWVSQOXAWLUYQHAO5UX/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: gitqlient-1.5.0-2.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SX_dR87dTO0EUgf1PTltn1MtRRM.html"}]}
