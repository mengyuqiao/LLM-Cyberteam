{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23227", "Description": "NUUO NVRmini2 through 3.11 allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload an encrypted TAR archive, which can be abused to add arbitrary users because of the lack of handle_import_user.php authentication. When combined with another flaw (CVE-2011-5325), it is possible to overwrite arbitrary files under the web root and achieve code execution as root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23227", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNuuo\u00bbNvrmini2 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.11.0cpe:2.3:o:nuuo:nvrmini2_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Nuuo\u00bbNvrmini2\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "3.81% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  6.85%  3.81%  -3.05 \n 2  2024-12-06  4.96%  6.85%  +1.90 \n 3  2024-09-29  3.34%  4.96%  +1.62 \n 4  2024-09-16  2.38%  3.34%  +0.96 \n 5  2024-08-20  1.69%  2.38%  +0.69 \n 6  2024-04-07  1.32%  1.69%  +0.38 \n 7  2023-11-03  1.34%  1.32%  -0.02 \n 8  2023-10-04  0.95%  1.34%  +0.39 \n 9  2023-09-05  0.66%  0.95%  +0.29 \n 10  2023-08-22  0.46%  0.66%  +0.19 \n 11  2023-08-07  0.37%  0.46%  +0.10 \n 12  2023-06-27  0.34%  0.37%  +0.03 \n 13  2023-06-14  0.25%  0.34%  +0.10 \n 14  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.25%  -2.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/NUUO/nuuo_nvrmini_round2.mkd", "ref_desc": "PoC/nuuo_nvrmini_round2.mkd at master \u00b7 pedrib/PoC \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researcher-discloses-alleged-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-nuuo-nvrmini2-recording-device", "ref_desc": "Researcher discloses alleged zero-day vulnerabilities in NUUO NVRmini2 recording device | The Daily SwigExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29936569", "ref_desc": "Researcher discloses alleged zero-day vulnerabilities in NUUO NVRmini2 recording | Hacker NewsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/16044", "ref_desc": "Add exploit for NUUO NVRmini2 zero day unauth RCE as root by pedrib \u00b7 Pull Request #16044 \u00b7 rapid7/metasploit-framework \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
