{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21694", "Description": "OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. The website mode of the onionshare allows to use a hardened CSP, which will block any scripts and external resources. It is not possible to configure this CSP for individual pages and therefore the security enhancement cannot be used for websites using javascript or external resources like fonts or images.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21694", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOnionshare\u00bbOnionshareVersions  before (<) 2.5cpe:2.3:a:onionshare:onionshare:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-03  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-29  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/security/advisories/GHSA-h29c-wcm8-883h", "ref_desc": "OTF-006: Broken Website Hardening Control: The CSP can be turned on or off but not configured for the specific needs of the website \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 onionshare/onionshare \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/releases/tag/v2.5", "ref_desc": "Release OnionShare 2.5 \u00b7 onionshare/onionshare \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Mv_ifDy4NsAMcyDKDF5TMzqWqeI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/issues/1389", "ref_desc": "Use nginx as the web service, instead of flask's app.run \u00b7 Issue #1389 \u00b7 onionshare/onionshare \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
