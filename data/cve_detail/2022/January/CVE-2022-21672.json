{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21672", "Description": "make-ca is a utility to deliver and manage a complete PKI configuration for workstations and servers. Starting with version 0.9 and prior to version 1.10, make-ca misinterprets Mozilla certdata.txt and treats explicitly untrusted certificates like trusted ones, causing those explicitly untrusted certificates trusted by the system. The explicitly untrusted certificates were used by some CAs already hacked. Hostile attackers may perform a MIM attack exploiting them. Everyone using the affected versions of make-ca should upgrade to make-ca-1.10, and run `make-ca -f -g` as the `root` user to regenerate the trusted store immediately. As a workaround, users may delete the untrusted certificates from /etc/pki/tls and /etc/ssl/certs manually (or by a script), but this is not recommended because the manual changes will be overwritten next time running make-ca to update the trusted anchor.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21672", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfromscratch\u00bbMake-caVersions  from including (>=) 0.9andbefore (<) 1.10cpe:2.3:a:linuxfromscratch:make-ca:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.25%  +0.12 \n 2  2023-08-03  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-115 Misinterpretation of Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/115/Misinterpretation-of-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/arc/blfs-support/2022-01/msg00020.html", "ref_desc": "blfs-support - User Support for BLFS - confirm_actionMailing List;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lfs-book/make-ca/pull/20", "ref_desc": "make-ca: use --filter=ca-anchors for all stores by xry111 \u00b7 Pull Request #20 \u00b7 lfs-book/make-ca \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lfs-book/make-ca/security/advisories/GHSA-m5qh-728v-4xrx", "ref_desc": "/etc/pki/tls and /etc/ssl/certs include distrusted certificates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 lfs-book/make-ca \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lfs-book/make-ca/issues/19", "ref_desc": "/etc/pki/tls and /etc/ssl/certs include distrusted certificates \u00b7 Issue #19 \u00b7 lfs-book/make-ca \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
