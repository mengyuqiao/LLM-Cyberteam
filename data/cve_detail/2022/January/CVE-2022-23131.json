{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23131", "Description": "In the case of instances where the SAML SSO authentication is enabled (non-default), session data can be modified by a malicious actor, because a user login stored in the session was not verified. Malicious unauthenticated actor may exploit this issue to escalate privileges and gain admin access to Zabbix Frontend. To perform the attack, SAML authentication is required to be enabled and the actor has to know the username of Zabbix user (or use the guest account, which is disabled by default).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23131", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZabbix\u00bbZabbixVersions  from including (>=) 5.4.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.4.8cpe:2.3:a:zabbix:zabbix:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZabbix\u00bbZabbix\u00bbVersion:6.0.0UpdateAlpha1cpe:2.3:a:zabbix:zabbix:6.0.0:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.17%  97.15%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-11-21  97.15%  97.17%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-11-08  97.07%  97.15%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-10-24  96.96%  97.07%  +0.10 \n 5  2024-09-28  97.00%  96.96%  -0.03 \n 6  2024-09-17  97.07%  97.00%  -0.07 \n 7  2024-09-02  96.96%  97.07%  +0.10 \n 8  2024-08-07  97.00%  96.96%  -0.03 \n 9  2024-07-25  96.97%  97.00%  +0.03 \n 10  2024-06-28  96.98%  96.97%  -0.01 \n 11  2024-06-16  97.08%  96.98%  -0.10 \n 12  2024-05-20  97.17%  97.08%  -0.09 \n 13  2024-05-06  97.19%  97.17%  -0.01 \n 14  2024-03-25  97.15%  97.19%  +0.04 \n 15  2024-03-13  97.20%  97.15%  -0.06 \n 16  2024-02-26  97.18%  97.20%  +0.03 \n 17  2024-02-14  97.18%  97.18%  -0.01 \n 18  2024-02-09  97.17%  97.18%  +0.01 \n 19  2024-02-07  96.95%  97.17%  +0.22 \n 20  2024-01-10  96.93%  96.95%  +0.02 \n 21  2023-09-22  97.09%  96.93%  -0.16 \n 22  2023-09-18  97.04%  97.09%  +0.04 \n 23  2023-08-21  97.13%  97.04%  -0.09 \n 24  2023-08-06  97.17%  97.13%  -0.04 \n 25  2023-07-24  97.13%  97.17%  +0.04 \n 26  2023-07-09  97.13%  97.13%  +0.01 \n 27  2023-06-26  97.21%  97.13%  -0.09 \n 28  2023-06-13  97.07%  97.21%  +0.14 \n 29  2023-05-30  97.08%  97.07%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-20350", "ref_desc": "[ZBX-20350] Unsafe client-side session storage leading to authentication bypass / instance takeover via Zabbix Frontend with configured SAML (CVE-2022-23131) - ZABBIX SUPPORTIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
