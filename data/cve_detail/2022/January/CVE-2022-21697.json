{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21697", "Description": "Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy web services. Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled is affected. A lack of input validation allows authenticated clients to proxy requests to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication is required, which already grants permissions to make the same requests via kernel or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity. Users may upgrade to version 3.2.1 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, install the patch manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21697", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbJupyter Server ProxyVersions  before (<) 3.2.1cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyter_server_proxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-11-14  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-16  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-18  0.11%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.12%  -2.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/compare/v3.2.0...v3.2.1.patch", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-gcv9-6737-pjqw", "ref_desc": "SSRF vulnerability (requires authentication) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/commit/fd31930bacd12188c448c886e0783529436b99eb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-gcv9-6737-pjqw \u00b7 jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy@fd31930 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
