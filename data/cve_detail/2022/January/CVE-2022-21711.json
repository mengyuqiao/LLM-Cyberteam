{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21711", "Description": "elfspirit is an ELF static analysis and injection framework that parses, manipulates, and camouflages ELF files. When analyzing the ELF file format in versions prior to 1.1, there is an out-of-bounds read bug, which can lead to application crashes or information leakage. By constructing a special format ELF file, the information of any address can be leaked. elfspirit version 1.1 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21711", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElfspirit Project\u00bbElfspiritVersions  before (<) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:elfspirit_project:elfspirit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.18%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-12-16  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-10-09  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-08-30  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-09-15  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-09-01  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-08-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-07-07  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/liyansong2018/elfspirit/issues/1", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read in elf parsing. \u00b7 Issue #1 \u00b7 liyansong2018/elfspirit \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/liyansong2018/elfspirit/security/advisories/GHSA-jr8h-2657-m68r", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds Read in parsing component. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 liyansong2018/elfspirit \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/liyansong2018/elfspirit/commit/c5b0f5a9a24f2451bbeda4751d67633bc375e608", "ref_desc": "Fix #1 about out-of-bounds \u00b7 liyansong2018/elfspirit@c5b0f5a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
