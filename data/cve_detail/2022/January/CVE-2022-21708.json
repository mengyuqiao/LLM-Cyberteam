{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21708", "Description": "graphql-go is a GraphQL server with a focus on ease of use. In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21708", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGraphql-go Project\u00bbGraphql-goVersions  before (<) 1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:graphql-go_project:graphql-go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-14  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go/security/advisories/GHSA-mh3m-8c74-74xh", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service caused by a bug in the MaxDepth schema option \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 graph-gophers/graphql-go \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go/commit/eae31ca73eb3473c544710955d1dbebc22605bfe", "ref_desc": "validation: fix bug in maxDepth fragment spread logic (#492) \u00b7 graph-gophers/graphql-go@eae31ca \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
