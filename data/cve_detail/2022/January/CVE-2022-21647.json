{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21647", "Description": "CodeIgniter is an open source PHP full-stack web framework. Deserialization of Untrusted Data was found in the `old()` function in CodeIgniter4. Remote attackers may inject auto-loadable arbitrary objects with this vulnerability, and possibly execute existing PHP code on the server. We are aware of a working exploit, which can lead to SQL injection. Users are advised to upgrade to v4.1.6 or later. Users unable to upgrade as advised to not use the `old()` function and form_helper nor `RedirectResponse::withInput()` and `redirect()->withInput()`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21647", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nCodeigniter\u00bbCodeigniterVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.1.6cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter:codeigniter:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "5.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  7.51%  5.45%  -2.07 \n 2  2024-09-19  9.99%  7.51%  -2.48 \n 3  2024-08-10  9.99%  9.99%  0.00 \n 4  2024-05-22  8.25%  9.99%  +1.74 \n 5  2024-05-07  6.90%  8.25%  +1.36 \n 6  2024-03-28  5.25%  6.90%  +1.65 \n 7  2024-03-13  5.29%  5.25%  -0.04 \n 8  2024-02-14  5.76%  5.29%  -0.47 \n 9  2024-01-31  7.81%  5.76%  -2.05 \n 10  2024-01-18  8.87%  7.81%  -1.06 \n 11  2024-01-01  7.94%  8.87%  +0.92 \n 12  2023-12-20  6.70%  7.94%  +1.24 \n 13  2023-12-04  8.37%  6.70%  -1.67 \n 14  2023-11-07  10.32%  8.37%  -1.95 \n 15  2023-10-09  8.59%  10.32%  +1.73 \n 16  2023-08-26  8.57%  8.59%  +0.02 \n 17  2023-07-28  5.71%  8.57%  +2.87 \n 18  2023-06-17  5.26%  5.71%  +0.45 \n 19  2023-05-21  6.67%  5.26%  -1.42 \n 20  2023-04-24  7.90%  6.67%  -1.23 \n 21  2023-03-16  6.65%  7.90%  +1.25 \n 22  2023-03-07  1.06%  6.65%  +5.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/security/advisories/GHSA-w6jr-wj64-mc9x", "ref_desc": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Codeigniter4 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4 \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/commit/ce95ed5765256e2f09f3513e7d42790e0d6948f5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-w6jr-wj64-mc9x \u00b7 codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4@ce95ed5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
