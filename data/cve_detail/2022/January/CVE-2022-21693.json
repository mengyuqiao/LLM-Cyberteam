{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21693", "Description": "OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions an adversary with a primitive that allows for filesystem access from the context of the Onionshare process can access sensitive files in the entire user home folder. This could lead to the leaking of sensitive data. Due to the automatic exclusion of hidden folders, the impact is reduced. This can be mitigated by usage of the flatpak release.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21693", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nOnionshare\u00bbOnionshareVersions  before (<) 2.5cpe:2.3:a:onionshare:onionshare:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-11  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/releases/tag/v2.5", "ref_desc": "Release OnionShare 2.5 \u00b7 onionshare/onionshare \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Mv_ifDy4NsAMcyDKDF5TMzqWqeI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/security/advisories/GHSA-jgm9-xpfj-4fq6", "ref_desc": "OTF-013: Improper Hardening: The filesystem restriction could be hardened and should only allow for pre-defined subfolders \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 onionshare/onionshare \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
