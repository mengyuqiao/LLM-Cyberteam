{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21671", "Description": "@replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit's container protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive information exists in versions prior to 7.3.1. When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server that is outside of Replit's control and the token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched in version 7.3.1 by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new one. As a workaround, a user may specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21671", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nReplit\u00bbCrosisVersions  before (<) 7.3.1cpe:2.3:a:replit:crosis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2023-08-04  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-24  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/replit/crosis/security/advisories/GHSA-7w54-gp8x-f33m", "ref_desc": "Potential exposure of Replit tokens to an Unauthorized Actor when using the default fallback WebSocket polling proxy in @replit/crosis \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 replit/crosis \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/replit/crosis/commit/e44b6a8f5fa28cb2872e3c19bb8a205bb5bfc281", "ref_desc": "Change the default polling host to `gp-v2.replit.com` (#113) \u00b7 replit/crosis@e44b6a8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
