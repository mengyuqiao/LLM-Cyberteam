{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21646", "Description": "SpiceDB is a database system for managing security-critical application permissions. Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion` or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return a resource as \"accessible\" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the exclusion. In `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the exclusion. Version 1.4.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, don't make use of wildcards on the right side of intersections or within exclusions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21646", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nAuthzed\u00bbSpicedb\u00bbVersion:1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:authzed:spicedb:1.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-155 Improper Neutralization of Wildcards or Matching Symbols", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/155/Improper-Neutralization-of-Wildcards-or-Matching-Symbols.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/358", "ref_desc": "unexpected expand/lookup behaviour with wildcard permissions \u00b7 Issue #358 \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.4.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.4.0 \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-7p8f-8hjm-wm92", "ref_desc": "Lookup operations do not take into account wildcards in intersections or exclusions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/15bba2e2d2a4bda336a37a7fe8ef8a35028cd970", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7p8f-8hjm-wm92 \u00b7 authzed/spicedb@15bba2e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
