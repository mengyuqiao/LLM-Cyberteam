{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21650", "Description": "Convos is an open source multi-user chat that runs in a web browser. You can't use SVG extension in Convos' chat window, but you can upload a file with an .html extension. By uploading an SVG file with an html extension the upload filter can be bypassed. This causes Stored XSS. Also, after uploading a file the XSS attack is triggered upon a user viewing the file. Through this vulnerability, an attacker is capable to execute malicious scripts. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21650", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nConvos\u00bbConvosVersions  from including (>=) 6.48andbefore (<) 6.52cpe:2.3:a:convos:convos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-07-28  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-30  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.pocas.kr/2021/12/30/2021-12-30-s-xss-convos-chat/#First-vulnerability", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in convos-chat/convosBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/commit/5c0a1ec9a2c147bc3b63fd5a48da5f32e18fe5df", "ref_desc": "Add more rules for files with Content-Disposition \u00b7 convos-chat/convos@5c0a1ec \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/ae424798-de01-4972-b73b-2db674f82368/", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored vulnerability found in convosExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/security/advisories/GHSA-mm2v-4v7g-m695", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via html file upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 convos-chat/convos \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
