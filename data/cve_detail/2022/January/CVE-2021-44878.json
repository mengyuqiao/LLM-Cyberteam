{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44878", "Description": "If an OpenID Connect provider supports the \"none\" algorithm (i.e., tokens with no signature), pac4j v5.3.0 (and prior) does not refuse it without an explicit configuration on its side or for the \"idtoken\" response type which is not secure and violates the OpenID Core Specification. The \"none\" algorithm does not require any signature verification when validating the ID tokens, which allows the attacker to bypass the token validation by injecting a malformed ID token using \"none\" as the value of \"alg\" key in the header with an empty signature value.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44878", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPac4j\u00bbPac4jVersions  before (<) 4.5.5cpe:2.3:a:pac4j:pac4j:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPac4j\u00bbPac4jVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.3.1cpe:2.3:a:pac4j:pac4j:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.12%  -0.13 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-12  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-07-17  0.16%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-07-30  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-06-19  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken", "ref_desc": "Final: OpenID Connect Core 1.0 incorporating errata set 1Product;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.pac4j.org/blog/cve_2021_44878_is_this_serious.html", "ref_desc": "pac4j: security for JavaMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/commit/22b82ffd702a132d9f09da60362fc6264fc281ae", "ref_desc": "reinforce security on OIDC \u00b7 pac4j/pac4j@22b82ff \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
