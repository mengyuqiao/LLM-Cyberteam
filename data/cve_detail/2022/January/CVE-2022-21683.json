{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21683", "Description": "Wagtail is a Django based content management system focused on flexibility and user experience. When notifications for new replies in comment threads are sent, they are sent to all users who have replied or commented anywhere on the site, rather than only in the relevant threads. This means that a user could listen in to new comment replies on pages they have not have editing access to, as long as they have left a comment or reply somewhere on the site. A patched version has been released as Wagtail 2.15.2, which restores the intended behaviour - to send notifications for new replies to the participants in the active thread only (editing permissions are not considered). New comments can be disabled by setting `WAGTAILADMIN_COMMENTS_ENABLED = False` in the Django settings file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21683", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 2.13andbefore (<) 2.15.2cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-xqxm-2rpm-3889", "ref_desc": "Comment reply notifications sent to incorrect users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/releases/tag/v2.15.2", "ref_desc": "Release 2.15.2 \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/5fe901e5d86ed02dbbb63039a897582951266afd", "ref_desc": "Fix commenting thread notifications being sent to non-thread users \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@5fe901e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
