{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21652", "Description": "Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform. In affected versions shopware would not invalidate a user session in the event of a password change. With version 5.7.7 the session validation was adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password change of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This also means, that upon a password change, all existing sessions for a given customer account are automatically considered invalid. There is no workaround for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21652", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  from including (>=) 5.7.3andbefore (<) 5.7.7cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-29  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-06-18  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-5-en/securityupdates/security-update-01-2022", "ref_desc": "Security Update 01/2022Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iLc3PjlVUQH7FgQ-eWFXcRM0qys.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-p523-jrph-qjc6", "ref_desc": "Automatically invalidate sessions upon password change \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/shopware \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/47ebd126a94f4b019b6fde64c0df3d18d74ef7d0", "ref_desc": "SW-26448 - Invalidate login in corresponding sessions when the passwo\u2026 \u00b7 shopware/shopware@47ebd12 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
