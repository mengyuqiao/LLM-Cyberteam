A user with privileges to update his password could change it to a weak password, such as those with a length of a single character. This may allow an attacker to brute-force users\u2019 passwords with minimal to no computational effort.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22110", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDaybydaycrm\u00bbDaybyday CrmVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.2.0cpe:2.3:a:daybydaycrm:daybyday_crm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-09-20  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-11  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-29  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-06-18  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Bottelet/DaybydayCRM/commit/a0392f4a4a14e1e3fedaf6817aefce69b6bd661b", "ref_desc": "password change requires 6 on update, and only allowed users can see \u2026 \u00b7 Bottelet/DaybydayCRM@a0392f4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0KZUOEUxhhwQYEUx7RD2hloJ2Xg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-22110", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-22110 | WhiteSource Vulnerability DatabaseThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
