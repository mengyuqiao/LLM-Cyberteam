{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-22707", "Description": "In lighttpd 1.4.46 through 1.4.63, the mod_extforward_Forwarded function of the mod_extforward plugin has a stack-based buffer overflow (4 bytes representing -1), as demonstrated by remote denial of service (daemon crash) in a non-default configuration. The non-default configuration requires handling of the Forwarded header in a somewhat unusual manner. Also, a 32-bit system is much more likely to be affected than a 64-bit system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22707", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLighttpd\u00bbLighttpdVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.46andup to, including, (<=) 1.4.63cpe:2.3:a:lighttpd:lighttpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.07%  2.64%  -0.43 \n 2  2024-09-21  2.71%  3.07%  +0.36 \n 3  2024-08-12  2.25%  2.71%  +0.46 \n 4  2023-07-30  1.61%  2.25%  +0.64 \n 5  2023-06-19  1.46%  1.61%  +0.15 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  1.46%  +0.41 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/3134", "ref_desc": "Bug #3134: mod_extforward plugin has out-of-bounds (OOB) write of 4-byte -1 - Lighttpd - lighty labsExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5040", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5040-1 lighttpdThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
