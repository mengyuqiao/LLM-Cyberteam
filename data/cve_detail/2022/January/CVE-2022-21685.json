{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21685", "Description": "Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number `8a93fdc6c9f4eb1d2f2a11b7ff1d12d70bf5a664`, a bug in Frontier's MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer underflow in certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds. For release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is limited as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. Users who do not use MODEXP precompile in their runtime are not impacted. A patch is available in pull request #549.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21685", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nParity\u00bbFrontierVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2022-01-13cpe:2.3:a:parity:frontier:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-08-22  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/549", "ref_desc": "Handle 0 exponent with fudged length correctly in ModExp by notlesh \u00b7 Pull Request #549 \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/commit/8a93fdc6c9f4eb1d2f2a11b7ff1d12d70bf5a664", "ref_desc": "Handle 0 exponent with fudged length correctly in ModExp (#549) \u00b7 paritytech/frontier@8a93fdc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/security/advisories/GHSA-cjg2-2fjg-fph4", "ref_desc": "Integer underflow in the MODEXP precompile \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
