{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-22691", "Description": "The password reset component deployed within Umbraco uses the hostname supplied within the request host header when building a password reset URL. It may be possible to manipulate the URL sent to Umbraco users when so that it points to the attackers server thereby disclosing the password reset token if/when the link is followed. A related vulnerability (CVE-2022-22690) could allow this flaw to become persistent so that all password reset URLs are affected persistently following a successful attack. See the AppCheck advisory for further information and associated caveats.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22691", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco CmsVersions  before (<) 9.2.0cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-03  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-24  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-11  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-01  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://appcheck-ng.com/umbraco-applicationurl-overwrite-persistent-password-reset-poison-cve-2022-22690-cve-2022-22691/", "ref_desc": "Umbraco ApplicationURL Overwrite & Persistent Password Reset Poison (CVE-2022-22690 & CVE-2022-22691) | AppCheckExploit;Mitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LG0tHXSsGgJNIeCN8UiMTlQT9BE.html"}]}
