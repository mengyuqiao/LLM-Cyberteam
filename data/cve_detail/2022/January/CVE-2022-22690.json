{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-22690", "Description": "Within the Umbraco CMS, a configuration element named \"UmbracoApplicationUrl\" (or just \"ApplicationUrl\") is used whenever application code needs to build a URL pointing back to the site. For example, when a user resets their password and the application builds a password reset URL or when the administrator invites users to the site. For Umbraco versions less than 9.2.0, if the Application URL is not specifically configured, the attacker can manipulate this value and store it persistently affecting all users for components where the \"UmbracoApplicationUrl\" is used. For example, the attacker is able to change the URL users receive when resetting their password so that it points to the attackers server, when the user follows this link the reset token can be intercepted by the attacker resulting in account takeover.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22690", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco CmsVersions  before (<) 9.2.0cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-10-03  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-11  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://appcheck-ng.com/umbraco-applicationurl-overwrite-persistent-password-reset-poison-cve-2022-22690-cve-2022-22691/", "ref_desc": "Umbraco ApplicationURL Overwrite & Persistent Password Reset Poison (CVE-2022-22690 & CVE-2022-22691) | AppCheckExploit;Mitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LG0tHXSsGgJNIeCN8UiMTlQT9BE.html"}]}
