{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21721", "Description": "Next.js is a React framework. Starting with version 12.0.0 and prior to version 12.0.9, vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone using i18n functionality. In order to be affected by this CVE, one must use next start or a custom server and the built-in i18n support. Deployments on Vercel, along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js, are not affected. A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. As a workaround, one may ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21721", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nVercel\u00bbNext.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andbefore (<) 12.0.9cpe:2.3:a:vercel:next.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-13  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-03  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-08  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-19  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-05  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-08-21  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-07-11  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.0.9", "ref_desc": "Release v12.0.9 \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/33503", "ref_desc": "Fix static file check with i18n by ijjk \u00b7 Pull Request #33503 \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-wr66-vrwm-5g5x", "ref_desc": "DOS Vulnerability for self-hosted next.js apps using i18n \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
