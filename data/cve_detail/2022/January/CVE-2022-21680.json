{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21680", "Description": "Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `block.def` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21680", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMarked Project\u00bbMarked\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.0.10cpe:2.3:a:marked_project:marked:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.30%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-09-29  0.31%  0.36%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-08-20  0.27%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.21%  0.27%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.14%  0.21%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-09-05  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-08-22  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-08-07  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-06-27  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.10%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/c4a3ccd344b6929afa8a1d50ac54a721e57012c0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-rrrm-qjm4-v8hf \u00b7 markedjs/marked@c4a3ccd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-rrrm-qjm4-v8hf", "ref_desc": "Cubic catastrophic backtracking (ReDoS) in `block.def` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 markedjs/marked \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/releases/tag/v4.0.10", "ref_desc": "Release v4.0.10 \u00b7 markedjs/marked \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AIXDMC3CSHYW3YWVSQOXAWLUYQHAO5UX/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: gitqlient-1.5.0-2.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SX_dR87dTO0EUgf1PTltn1MtRRM.html"}]}
