{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-22115", "Description": "In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the name of a created Tag. Since the Tag name is not being sanitized properly in the edit tag page, a low privileged attacker can store malicious scripts in the name of the Tag. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, and privileges escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22115", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSismics\u00bbTeedyVersions  from including (>=) 1.5andup to, including, (<=) 1.9cpe:2.3:a:sismics:teedy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-08-03  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-06-23  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sismics/docs/commit/4951229576d6892dc58ab8c572e73639ca82d80c", "ref_desc": "escape ngTranslate parameters \u00b7 sismics/docs@4951229 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NAltAEC29GAlvraH_3uloHLwCj8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-22115", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-22115 | WhiteSource Vulnerability DatabaseExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
