{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-22114", "Description": "In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The \u201csearch term\" search functionality is not sufficiently sanitized while displaying the results of the search, which can be leveraged to inject arbitrary scripts. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they enter the crafted URL. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, by an unauthenticated attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22114", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSismics\u00bbTeedyVersions  from including (>=) 1.5andup to, including, (<=) 1.9cpe:2.3:a:sismics:teedy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.35%  +0.18 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.17%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-08-10  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 4  2023-08-03  0.22%  0.17%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-06-23  0.20%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.20%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-22114", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-22114 | WhiteSource Vulnerability DatabaseExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sismics/docs/commit/4951229576d6892dc58ab8c572e73639ca82d80c", "ref_desc": "escape ngTranslate parameters \u00b7 sismics/docs@4951229 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NAltAEC29GAlvraH_3uloHLwCj8.html"}]}
