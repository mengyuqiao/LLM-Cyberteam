{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23599", "Description": "Products.ATContentTypes are the core content types for Plone 2.1 - 4.3. Versions of Plone that are dependent on Products.ATContentTypes prior to version 3.0.6 are vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the image_view_fullscreen page in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique is known as cache poisoning. Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page. Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on the user's cache settings. Version 3.0.6 of Products.ATContentTypes has been released with a fix. This version works on Plone 5.2, Python 2 only. As a workaround, make sure the image_view_fullscreen page is not stored in the cache. More information about the vulnerability and cvmitigation measures is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23599", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nPlone\u00bbPloneVersions  before (<) 3.0.6cpe:2.3:a:plone:plone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/plone/Products.ATContentTypes/commit/fc793f88f35a15a68b52e4abed77af0da5fdbab8", "ref_desc": "Security fix: prevent cache poisoning with the Referer header. \u00b7 plone/Products.ATContentTypes@fc793f8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/plone/Products.ATContentTypes/security/advisories/GHSA-g4c2-ghfg-g5rh", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') and URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in Products.ATContentTypes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 plone/Products.ATCoThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
