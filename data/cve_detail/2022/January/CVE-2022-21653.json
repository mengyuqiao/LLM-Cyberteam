{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-21653", "Description": "Jawn is an open source JSON parser. Extenders of the `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade` and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who don't override `objectContext()` are vulnerable to a hash collision attack which may result in a denial of service. Most applications do not implement these traits directly, but inherit from a library. `jawn-parser-1.3.1` fixes this issue and users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade override `objectContext()` to use a collision-safe collection.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21653", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nTypelevel\u00bbJawnVersions  before (<) 1.3.2cpe:2.3:a:typelevel:jawn:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-20  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-11  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-29  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-06-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/typelevel/jawn/security/advisories/GHSA-vc89-hccf-rq55", "ref_desc": "Hash collision in MutableFacade and SimpleFacade \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 typelevel/jawn \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/typelevel/jawn/pull/390", "ref_desc": "Use TreeMap in SimpleFacade to solve DoS vuln by kag0 \u00b7 Pull Request #390 \u00b7 typelevel/jawn \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
