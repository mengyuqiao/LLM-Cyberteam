{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43974", "Description": "An issue was discovered in SysAid ITIL 20.4.74 b10. The /enduserreg endpoint is used to register end users anonymously, but does not respect the server-side setting that determines if anonymous users are allowed to register new accounts. Configuring the server-side setting to disable anonymous user registration only hides the client-side registration form. An attacker can still post registration data to create new accounts without prior authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43974", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSysaid\u00bbItil\u00bbVersion:20.4.74UpdateB10cpe:2.3:a:sysaid:itil:20.4.74:b10:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-17  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-04  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-04  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-06-24  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2022-0001.md", "ref_desc": "advisories/ATREDIS-2022-0001.md at master \u00b7 atredispartners/advisories \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/g_lyGfqBiQRo-Q5hMjZEk42X6yk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2021-0002.md", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/igd00CUTxSsL1_yAsrRSto3awWs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sysaid.com/it-service-management-software/incident-management", "ref_desc": "ITIL Incident Management Software | SysAidVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wvBoQUX1zFY2k7d0nylaF1Ixd9c.html"}]}
