{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29172", "Description": "Auth0 is an authentication broker that supports both social and enterprise identity providers, including Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps, and Salesforce. In versions before `11.33.0`, when the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional signup fields\u00e2\u20ac? feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields), a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property). Verification emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email template. You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional signup fields\u00e2\u20ac? feature in your application.
