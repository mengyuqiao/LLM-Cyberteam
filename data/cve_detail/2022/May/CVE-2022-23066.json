{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23066", "Description": "In Solana rBPF versions 0.2.26 and 0.2.27 are affected by Incorrect Calculation which is caused by improper implementation of sdiv instruction. This can lead to the wrong execution path, resulting in huge loss in specific cases. For example, the result of a sdiv instruction may decide whether to transfer tokens or not. The vulnerability affects both integrity and may cause serious availability problems.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23066", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolana\u00bbRbpf\u00bbVersion:0.2.27cpe:2.3:a:solana:rbpf:0.2.27:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSolana\u00bbRbpf\u00bbVersion:0.2.26cpe:2.3:a:solana:rbpf:0.2.26:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.09%  -0.22 \n 2  2024-12-13  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-11-04  0.27%  0.27%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-07-30  0.21%  0.27%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-01-27  0.21%  0.21%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-12-29  0.13%  0.21%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-12-15  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-11-30  0.11%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-10-20  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-06-11  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-05-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-04-09  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.07%  -2.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/682/Incorrect-Calculation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blocksecteam.medium.com/how-a-critical-bug-in-solana-network-was-detected-and-timely-patched-a701870e1324", "ref_desc": "Please Wait... | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-23066", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-23066 | WhiteSource Vulnerability DatabaseExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/solana-labs/rbpf/commit/e61e045f8c244de978401d186dcfd50838817297", "ref_desc": "jit: sign-extend the quotient register on sdiv32 (#310) \u00b7 solana-labs/rbpf@e61e045 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
