{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30618", "Description": "An authenticated user with access to the Strapi admin panel can view private and sensitive data, such as email and password reset tokens, for API users if content types accessible to the authenticated user contain relationships to API users (from:users-permissions). There are many scenarios in which such details from API users can leak in the JSON response within the admin panel, either through a direct or indirect relationship. Access to this information enables a user to compromise these users\u2019 accounts if the password reset API endpoints have been enabled. In a worst-case scenario, a low-privileged user could get access to a high-privileged API account, and could read and modify any data as well as block access to both the admin panel and API by revoking privileges for all other users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30618", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nStrapi\u00bbStrapiVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.6.10cpe:2.3:a:strapi:strapi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nStrapi\u00bbStrapiVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.1.10cpe:2.3:a:strapi:strapi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-10  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-30  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-26  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-04-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/212/Improper-Removal-of-Sensitive-Information-Before-Storage-or-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cyrc-advisory-strapi", "ref_desc": "CyRC Vulnerability Advisory: Sensitive data exposure in JSON enables account compromise in Strapi | SynopsysThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XVeky7JSEJVdZBZBWeSrwH8Voh0.html"}]}
