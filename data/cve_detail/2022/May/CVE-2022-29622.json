{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29622", "Description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in formidable v3.1.4 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted filename. NOTE: some third parties dispute this issue because the product has common use cases in which uploading arbitrary files is the desired behavior. Also, there are configuration options in all versions that can change the default behavior of how files are handled. Strapi does not consider this to be a valid vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29622", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFormidable Project\u00bbFormidable\u00bbVersion:3.1.4ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:formidable_project:formidable:3.1.4:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.27%  2.39%  +1.12 \n 2  2024-11-11  1.26%  1.27%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-08-07  0.98%  1.26%  +0.28 \n 4  2024-04-27  0.44%  0.98%  +0.53 \n 5  2024-03-23  0.39%  0.44%  +0.05 \n 6  2024-02-03  0.39%  0.39%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-05  0.24%  0.39%  +0.14 \n 8  2023-12-22  0.20%  0.24%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-12-07  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 10  2023-11-08  0.20%  0.20%  0.00 \n 11  2023-10-27  0.21%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 12  2023-06-18  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 13  2023-05-23  0.10%  0.19%  +0.09 \n 14  2023-04-16  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 15  2023-03-11  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 16  2023-03-07  26.89%  0.10%  -26.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/%40zsolt.imre/is-cybersecurity-the-next-supply-chain-vulnerability-9a00de745022", "ref_desc": "410 Deleted by author \u2014 Medium", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/issues/856", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability CVE-2022-29622 is reported by Whitesource \u00b7 Issue #856 \u00b7 node-formidable/formidable \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/issues/862", "ref_desc": "Filename filtering is inappropriate \u00b7 Issue #862 \u00b7 node-formidable/formidable \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6QPKooxhAo", "ref_desc": "Before you continue to YouTubeExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/20189", "ref_desc": "NOTICE: Formidable Vulnerability is NOT valid \u00b7 Issue #20189 \u00b7 strapi/strapi \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://medium.com/@zsolt.imre/is-cybersecurity-the-next-supply-chain-vulnerability-9a00de745022", "ref_desc": "Please Wait... | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
