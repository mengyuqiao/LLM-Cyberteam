{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24584", "Description": "Incorrect access control in Yubico OTP functionality of the YubiKey hardware tokens along with the Yubico OTP validation server. The Yubico OTP supposedly creates hardware bound second factor credentials. When a user reprograms the OTP functionality by \"writing\" it on a token using the Yubico Personalization Tool, they can then upload the new configuration to Yubicos OTP validation servers. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because there is no way for a YubiKey device to prevent a user from deciding that a secret value, which is imported into the device, should also be stored elsewhere", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24584", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nYubico\u00bbOTP\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:yubico:otp:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-08-02  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-02  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-18  0.07%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-04-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://demo.yubico.com/otp/verify", "ref_desc": "Yubico demo websiteVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pastebin.com/xAh8uV6J", "ref_desc": "Response to the disputing comments from the Vendor:Nowhere is claimed that t - Pastebin.comThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pastebin.com/7iLR1EbW", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-24584: Incorrect access control in Yubico OTP functionality of the Yu b - Pastebin.comExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://upload.yubico.com/", "ref_desc": "Yubico OTP key uploadVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
