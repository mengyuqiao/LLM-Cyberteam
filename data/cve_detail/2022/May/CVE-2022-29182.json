{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29182", "Description": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions 19.11.0 through 21.4.0 (inclusive) are vulnerable to a Document Object Model (DOM)-based cross-site scripting attack via a pipeline run's Stage Details > Graphs tab. It is possible for a malicious script on a attacker-hosted site to execute script that will run within the user's browser context and GoCD session via abuse of a messaging channel used for communication between with the parent page and the stage details graph's iframe. This could allow an attacker to steal a GoCD user's session cookies and/or execute malicious code in the user's context. This issue is fixed in GoCD 22.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29182", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  from including (>=) 19.11.0andup to, including, (<=) 21.4.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-11  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-qcg6-4q44-3589", "ref_desc": "DOM-based XSS possible via a pipeline run's stage detail graphs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/10190/commits/a256d05de1445e6c77843f098581fc6a66fe4477", "ref_desc": "Validation tweak on stage details graphs/stats tab by chadlwilson \u00b7 Pull Request #10190 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#22-1-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CK-PfRmwBo8nAl6cT8OwKhSxscw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/22.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release GoCD 22.1.0 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kg2VRgJaoWsT8tlmFzg8TXhy0Zc.html"}]}
