{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24877", "Description": "Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Path Traversal in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml` allows an attacker to expose sensitive data from the controller\u2019s pod filesystem and possibly privilege escalation in multi-tenancy deployments. Workarounds include automated tooling in the user's CI/CD pipeline to validate `kustomization.yaml` files conform with specific policies. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24877", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFluxcd\u00bbKustomize-controllerVersions  before (<) 0.24.0cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:kustomize-controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFluxcd\u00bbFlux2Versions  before (<) 0.29.0cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:flux2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-01  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-11-26  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-16  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-12  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-04-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-36 Absolute Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/36/Absolute-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-j77r-2fxf-5jrw", "ref_desc": "Improper path handling in Kustomization files allows path traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fluxcd/flux2 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
