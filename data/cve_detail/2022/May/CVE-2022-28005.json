{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-28005", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the 3CX Phone System Management Console prior to version 18 Update 3 FINAL. An unauthenticated attacker could abuse improperly secured access to arbitrary files on the server (via /Electron/download directory traversal in conjunction with a path component that uses backslash characters), leading to cleartext credential disclosure. Afterwards, the authenticated attacker is able to upload a file that overwrites a 3CX service binary, leading to Remote Code Execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM on Windows installations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-48482.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28005", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\n3CX\u00bb3CXVersions  up to, including, (<=) 18.0.3.450cpe:2.3:a:3cx:3cx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.10%  1.93%  -0.18 \n 2  2024-12-10  1.87%  2.10%  +0.23 \n 3  2024-11-14  1.57%  1.87%  +0.30 \n 4  2024-02-23  1.49%  1.57%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-12-26  1.03%  1.49%  +0.47 \n 6  2023-12-12  0.87%  1.03%  +0.16 \n 7  2023-11-27  0.84%  0.87%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-10-17  0.86%  0.84%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-06-08  0.83%  0.86%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-05-13  0.53%  0.83%  +0.30 \n 11  2023-05-08  0.45%  0.53%  +0.09 \n 12  2023-05-02  0.32%  0.45%  +0.13 \n 13  2023-04-06  0.29%  0.32%  +0.03 \n 14  2023-03-07  5.63%  0.29%  -5.35 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.3cx.com/blog/releases/v18-update-3-final/", "ref_desc": "3CX V18 Update 3 Final is now available to downloadRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.3cx.com/blog/change-log/phone-system-change-log/", "ref_desc": "3CX Build History / Change LogRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/n2zhYfFD_q2sRqj7sK-2np8wLos.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.3cx.com/blog/releases/v18-security-hotfix/", "ref_desc": "New security and memory Hotfix now available for V18 Update 3 | 3CXRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://medium.com/@frycos/pwning-3cx-phone-management-backends-from-the-internet-d0096339dd88", "ref_desc": "Pwning 3CX Phone Management Backends from the Internet | by frycos | MediumCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SwB5rn6BccL5gUFAEXi52bcZXnk.html"}]}
