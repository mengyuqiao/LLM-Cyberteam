{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24905", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. A vulnerability was found in Argo CD prior to versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15 that allows an attacker to spoof error messages on the login screen when single sign on (SSO) is enabled. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to trick the victim to visit a specially crafted URL which contains the message to be displayed. As far as the research of the Argo CD team concluded, it is not possible to specify any active content (e.g. Javascript) or other HTML fragments (e.g. clickable links) in the spoofed message. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24905", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.9cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 0.6.1andbefore (<) 2.1.15cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-31  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-22  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.3.4", "ref_desc": "Release v2.3.4 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GSVobfZhR9QcIEVPWsKNvwLpXSs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.1.15", "ref_desc": "Release v2.1.15 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/onOPdCmxcj0BE5M-KFe3OOqLmSw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-xmg8-99r8-jc2j", "ref_desc": "Login screen allows message spoofing if SSO is enabled \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.2.9", "ref_desc": "Release v2.2.9 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/t1HnUBpQ6iQgVh1T1enw1qpiZPA.html"}]}
