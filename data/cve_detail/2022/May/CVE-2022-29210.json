{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29210", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In version 2.8.0, the `TensorKey` hash function used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as `tstring` include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves. This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and 2.8.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29210", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.8.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-25  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f3b9bf4c3c0597563b289c0512e98d4ce81f886e/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_key.h#L53-L64", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/tensor_key.h at f3b9bf4c3c0597563b289c0512e98d4ce81f886e \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.9.0", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.9.0 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oS6kEomIcee4cLacB1gw4ywjzhI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1b85a28d395dc91f4d22b5f9e1e9a22e92ccecd6", "ref_desc": "Fix TensorKey hash function. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@1b85a28 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.8.1", "ref_desc": "Release TensorFlow 2.8.1 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Q-0C0387FgK3uxLT6o5QFTF6-gQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-hc2f-7r5r-r2hg", "ref_desc": "Heap buffer overflow due to incorrect hash function \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
