The \u201caddCell\u201d JavaScript function fails to properly sanitize user-controllable input before including it into the generated XML body of the XLS report document, such that it is possible to inject arbitrary content (e.g., XML tags) into the generated file. An attacker with restricted privileges, by poisoning any of the content used to generate XLS reports, could be able to leverage the application to deliver malicious files against higher-privileged users and obtain Remote Code Execution (RCE) against the administrator\u2019s workstation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24039", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbDesigo Pxc5 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 02.20.142.10-10884cpe:2.3:o:siemens:desigo_pxc5_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbDesigo Pxc5\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSiemens\u00bbDesigo Pxc4 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 02.20.142.10-10884cpe:2.3:o:siemens:desigo_pxc4_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbDesigo Pxc4\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-01  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-21  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-17  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-04-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-75 Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/75/Failure-to-Sanitize-Special-Elements-into-a-Different-Plane-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-626968.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RvXYz1zYcn-HwbqJLm9mYwmC3hA.html"}]}
