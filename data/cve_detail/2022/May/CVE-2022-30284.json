{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30284", "Description": "In the python-libnmap package through 0.7.2 for Python, remote command execution can occur (if used in a client application that does not validate arguments). NOTE: the vendor believes it would be unrealistic for an application to call NmapProcess with arguments taken from input data that arrived over an untrusted network, and thus the CVSS score corresponds to an unrealistic use case. None of the NmapProcess documentation implies that this is an expected use case", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30284", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPython-libnmap Project\u00bbPython-libnmap\u00bbForPythonVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.7.2cpe:2.3:a:python-libnmap_project:python-libnmap:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "20.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.90%  20.07%  +17.17 \n 2  2024-12-08  2.47%  2.90%  +0.43 \n 3  2024-05-30  3.27%  2.47%  -0.80 \n 4  2024-02-21  2.90%  3.27%  +0.37 \n 5  2023-12-24  2.10%  2.90%  +0.80 \n 6  2023-12-10  1.72%  2.10%  +0.38 \n 7  2023-11-25  1.92%  1.72%  -0.20 \n 8  2023-10-15  1.56%  1.92%  +0.37 \n 9  2023-06-06  0.89%  1.56%  +0.67 \n 10  2023-05-24  0.69%  0.89%  +0.19 \n 11  2023-05-11  0.41%  0.69%  +0.28 \n 12  2023-05-08  0.49%  0.41%  -0.08 \n 13  2023-04-30  0.42%  0.49%  +0.07 \n 14  2023-04-04  0.37%  0.42%  +0.06 \n 15  2023-03-07  5.63%  0.37%  -5.27 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/savon-noir/python-libnmap/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 savon-noir/python-libnmap \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://libnmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process.html#using-libnmap-process", "ref_desc": "libnmap.process \u2014 libnmap 0.2 documentationExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.swascan.com/security-advisory-libnmap-2/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory: Libnmap <= 0.7.2 - SwascanExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/python-libnmap/", "ref_desc": "python-libnmap \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
