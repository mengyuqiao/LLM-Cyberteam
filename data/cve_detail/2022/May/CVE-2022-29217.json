{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29217", "Description": "PyJWT is a Python implementation of RFC 7519. PyJWT supports multiple different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an attacker submitting the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm. The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms are supported. The application can specify `jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` to get support for all algorithms, or specify a single algorithm. The issue is not that big as `algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` has to be used. Users should upgrade to v2.4.0 to receive a patch for this issue. As a workaround, always be explicit with the algorithms that are accepted and expected when decoding.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29217", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPyjwt Project\u00bbPyjwtVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:pyjwt_project:pyjwt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-12-02  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-15  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-05  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-29  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-26  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-31  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-04-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5PK7IQCBVNLYJEFTPHBBPFP72H4WUFNX/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: python-jwt-2.4.0-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6HIYEYZRQEP6QTHT3EHH3RGFYJIHIMAO/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: python-jwt-2.4.0-1.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/commit/9c528670c455b8d948aff95ed50e22940d1ad3fc", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-ffqj-6fqr-9h24 \u00b7 jpadilla/pyjwt@9c52867 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/releases/tag/2.4.0", "ref_desc": "Release 2.4.0 \u00b7 jpadilla/pyjwt \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/security/advisories/GHSA-ffqj-6fqr-9h24", "ref_desc": "Key confusion through non-blocklisted public key formats \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jpadilla/pyjwt \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
