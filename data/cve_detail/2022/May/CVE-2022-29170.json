{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29170", "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In Grafana Enterprise, the Request security feature allows list allows to configure Grafana in a way so that the instance doesn\u2019t call or only calls specific hosts. The vulnerability present starting with version 7.4.0-beta1 and prior to versions 7.5.16 and 8.5.3 allows someone to bypass these security configurations if a malicious datasource (running on an allowed host) returns an HTTP redirect to a forbidden host. The vulnerability only impacts Grafana Enterprise when the Request security allow list is used and there is a possibility to add a custom datasource to Grafana which returns HTTP redirects. In this scenario, Grafana would blindly follow the redirects and potentially give secure information to the clients. Grafana Cloud is not impacted by this vulnerability. Versions 7.5.16 and 8.5.3 contain a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29170", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nGrafana\u00bbGrafana\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.5.3cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nGrafana\u00bbGrafana\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 7.4.0andbefore (<) 7.5.16cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-11  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 2  2023-08-25  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-27  0.07%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-04-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases/tag/v7.5.16", "ref_desc": "Release 7.5.16 (2022-05-19) \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases/tag/v8.5.3", "ref_desc": "Release 8.5.3 (2022-05-19) \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220707-0005/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-29170 Grafana Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/49240", "ref_desc": "Security: fixes CVE-2022-29170 by xlson \u00b7 Pull Request #49240 \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-9rrr-6fq2-4f99", "ref_desc": "Grafana Enterprise datasource network restrictions bypass via HTTP redirects \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
