{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29219", "Description": "Lodestar is a TypeScript implementation of the Ethereum Consensus specification. Prior to version 0.36.0, there is a possible consensus split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` being included on-chain. Because the developers represent `uint64` values as native javascript `number`s, there is an issue when those variables with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64` values are included on chain. In those cases, Lodestar may view valid_`AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` as invalid, due to rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes a consensus split, where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main network. Similarly, Lodestar may consider invalid `ProposerSlashing` as valid, thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid by the network. Version 0.36.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in `AttesterSlashing` and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too slow to be used in all `Slot` and `Epoch` cases, so one may carefully use `BigInt` just where necessary for consensus.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29219", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nChainsafe\u00bbLodestarVersions  before (<) 0.36.0cpe:2.3:a:chainsafe:lodestar:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-15  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-26  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-31  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/releases/tag/v0.36.0", "ref_desc": "Release Release v0.36.0 \u00b7 ChainSafe/lodestar \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3977", "ref_desc": "Reorg uint variables by dapplion \u00b7 Pull Request #3977 \u00b7 ChainSafe/lodestar \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/security/advisories/GHSA-cvj7-5f3c-9vg9", "ref_desc": "AttesterSlashing number overflow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ChainSafe/lodestar \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
