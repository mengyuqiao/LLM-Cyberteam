{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-25645", "Description": "All versions of package dset are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via 'dset/merge' mode, as the dset function checks for prototype pollution by validating if the top-level path contains __proto__, constructor or protorype. By crafting a malicious object, it is possible to bypass this check and achieve prototype pollution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25645", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDset Project\u00bbDset\u00bbForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:dset_project:dset:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.03% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.71%  1.03%  +0.32 \n 2  2024-12-05  0.58%  0.71%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-07-23  0.49%  0.58%  +0.10 \n 4  2023-12-21  0.41%  0.49%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-12-07  0.33%  0.41%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-11-22  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-10-12  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-09-12  0.14%  0.27%  +0.13 \n 9  2023-06-03  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-05-08  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-04-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DSET-2330881", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution in dset | CVE-2022-25645 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-2431974", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution in org.webjars.npm:dset | CVE-2022-25645 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lukeed/dset/blob/master/src/merge.js%23L9", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
