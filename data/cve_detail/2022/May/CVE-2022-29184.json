{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29184", "Description": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. In GoCD versions prior to 22.1.0, it is possible for existing authenticated users who have permissions to edit or create pipeline materials or pipeline configuration repositories to get remote code execution capability on the GoCD server via configuring a malicious branch name which abuses Mercurial hooks/aliases to exploit a command injection weakness. An attacker would require access to an account with existing GoCD administration permissions to either create/edit (`hg`-based) configuration repositories; create/edit pipelines and their (`hg`-based) materials; or, where \"pipelines-as-code\" configuration repositories are used, to commit malicious configuration to such an external repository which will be automatically parsed into a pipeline configuration and (`hg`) material definition by the GoCD server. This issue is fixed in GoCD 22.1.0. As a workaround, users who do not use/rely upon Mercurial materials can uninstall/remove the `hg`/Mercurial binary from the underlying GoCD Server operating system or Docker image.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29184", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  before (<) 22.1.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.73%  0.55%  -0.18 \n 2  2024-11-01  0.71%  0.73%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-23  0.50%  0.71%  +0.21 \n 4  2024-03-08  0.47%  0.50%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-01-09  0.33%  0.47%  +0.14 \n 6  2023-12-26  0.32%  0.33%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-12-11  0.33%  0.32%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-06-22  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-05-27  0.19%  0.30%  +0.10 \n 10  2023-05-16  0.18%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-04-20  0.15%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.15%  -4.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#22-1-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CK-PfRmwBo8nAl6cT8OwKhSxscw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/22.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release GoCD 22.1.0 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kg2VRgJaoWsT8tlmFzg8TXhy0Zc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-vf5r-r7j2-cf2h", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution possible via Mercurial command argument injection on materials \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/37d35115db2ada2190173f9413cfe1bc6c295ecb", "ref_desc": "Improve escaping of arguments when constructing Hg command calls \u00b7 gocd/gocd@37d3511 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
