{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29183", "Description": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions 20.2.0 until 21.4.0 are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting via abuse of the pipeline comparison function's error handling to render arbitrary HTML into the returned page. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into executing code which would allow the attacker to operate on, or gain control over the same resources as the victim had access to. This issue is fixed in GoCD 21.4.0. As a workaround, block access to `/go/compare/.*` prior to GoCD Server via a reverse proxy, web application firewall or equivalent, which would prevent use of the pipeline comparison function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29183", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  from including (>=) 20.2.0andbefore (<) 21.4.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-11-28  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-11  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-10-31  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/21.4.0", "ref_desc": "Release GoCD 21.4.0 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#21-4-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-3vvq-q4qv-x2gf", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS possible via pipeline comparisons \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/9829/commits/bda81084c0401234b168437cf35a63390e3064d1", "ref_desc": "Escape HTML in rendered error messages by chadlwilson \u00b7 Pull Request #9829 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
