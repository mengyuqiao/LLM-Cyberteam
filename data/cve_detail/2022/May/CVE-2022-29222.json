{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29222", "Description": "Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security. Prior to version 2.1.5, a DTLS Client could provide a Certificate that it doesn't posses the private key for and Pion DTLS wouldn't reject it. This issue affects users that are using Client certificates only. The connection itself is still secure. The Certificate provided by clients can't be trusted when using a Pion DTLS server prior to version 2.1.5. Users should upgrade to version 2.1.5 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29222", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPion\u00bbDtlsVersions  before (<) 2.1.5cpe:2.3:a:pion:dtls:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-22  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-27  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pion/dtls/releases/tag/v2.1.5", "ref_desc": "Release v2.1.5 \u00b7 pion/dtls \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pion/dtls/security/advisories/GHSA-w45j-f832-hxvh", "ref_desc": "Client Certificates are accepted without CertificateVerify \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pion/dtls \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pion/dtls/commit/d2f797183a9f044ce976e6df6f362662ca722412", "ref_desc": "Require CertificateVerify when Client Cert sent \u00b7 pion/dtls@d2f7971 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
