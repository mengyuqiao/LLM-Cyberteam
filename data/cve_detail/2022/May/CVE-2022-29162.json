{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29162", "Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29162", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbRuncVersions  before (<) 1.1.2cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:runc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.04%  -0.99 \n 3  2023-02-22  2.01%  1.03%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.2", "ref_desc": "Release v1.1.2 -- \"I should think I\u2019m going to be a perpetual student.\" \u00b7 opencontainers/runc \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AVPZBV7ISA7QKRPTC7ZXWKMIQI2HZEBB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: golang-github-opencontainers-runc-1.1.2-1.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/d04de3a9b72d7a2455c1885fc75eb36d02cd17b5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66 \u00b7 opencontainers/runc@d04de3a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GPQU4YC4AAY54JDXGDQHJEYKSXXG5T2Y/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: golang-github-opencontainers-runc-1.1.2-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/03/msg00023.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3369-1] runc security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QXLAeiM293RZ5evmvtZ_WoOfn1Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D77CKD3AXPMU4PMQIQI5Q74SI4JATNND/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: golang-github-opencontainers-runc-1.1.2-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66", "ref_desc": "Default inheritable capabilities for linux container should be empty \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencontainers/runc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
