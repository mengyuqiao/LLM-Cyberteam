{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26889", "Description": "In Splunk Enterprise versions before 8.1.2, the uri path to load a relative resource within a web page is vulnerable to path traversal. It allows an attacker to potentially inject arbitrary content into the web page (e.g., HTML Injection, XSS) or bypass SPL safeguards for risky commands. The attack is browser-based. An attacker cannot exploit the attack at will and requires the attacker to initiate a request within the victim's browser (e.g., phishing).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26889", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Directory traversal;Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSplunk\u00bbSplunk\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 8.1.0andbefore (<) 8.1.2cpe:2.3:a:splunk:splunk:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-01  0.28%  0.39%  +0.12 \n 2  2023-11-27  0.20%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-10-17  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-06-08  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-13  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-04-06  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://research.splunk.com/application/path_traversal_spl_injection/", "ref_desc": "Path traversal SPL injection - Splunk Security ContentVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security/announcements/svd-2022-0506.html", "ref_desc": "SVD-2022-0506 | SplunkVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
