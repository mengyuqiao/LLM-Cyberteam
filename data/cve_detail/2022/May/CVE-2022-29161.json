{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29161", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. The XWiki Crypto API will generate X509 certificates signed by default using SHA1 with RSA, which is not considered safe anymore for use in certificate signatures, due to the risk of collisions with SHA1. The problem has been patched in XWiki version 13.10.6, 14.3.1 and 14.4-rc-1. Since then, the Crypto API will generate X509 certificates signed by default using SHA256 with RSA. Administrators are advised to upgrade their XWiki installation to one of the patched versions. If the upgrade is not possible, it is possible to patch the module xwiki-platform-crypto in a local installation by applying the change exposed in 26728f3 and re-compiling the module.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29161", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  before (<) 13.10.6cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.3.1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-09  0.24%  0.28%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-13  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-25  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-12-11  0.16%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-11-26  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-10-16  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-06-07  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-05-12  0.07%  0.12%  +0.06 \n 9  2023-04-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19676", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19676] Update the RSA Crypto script service to use SHA256 instead of SHA1 for certificate signature - XWiki.org JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-h8v5-p258-pqf4", "ref_desc": "Crypto script service uses hashing algorithm SHA1 with RSA for certificate signature \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/26728f3f23658288683667a5182a916c7ecefc52", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19676: Update the RSA Crypto script service to use SHA256 inste\u2026 \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@26728f3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
