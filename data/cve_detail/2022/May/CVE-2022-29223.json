{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29223", "Description": "Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack. In versions prior to 6.1.10, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow by providing the Azure RTOS USBX host stack a HUB descriptor with `bNbPorts` set to a value greater than `UX_MAX_TT` which defaults to 8. For a `bNbPorts` value of 255, the implementation of `ux_host_class_hub_descriptor_get` function will modify the contents of `hub` -> `ux_host_class_hub_device` -> `ux_device_hub_tt` array violating the end boundary by 255 - `UX_MAX_TT` items. The USB host stack needs to validate the number of ports reported by the hub, and if the value is larger than UX_MAX_TT, USB stack needs to reject the request. This fix has been included in USBX release 6.1.10.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29223", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbAzure Rtos UsbxVersions  before (<) 6.1.10cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:azure_rtos_usbx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-06  0.26%  0.30%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-12-15  0.21%  0.26%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-11-05  0.17%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-08-03  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 5  2023-06-26  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-31  0.24%  0.16%  -0.09 \n 7  2023-05-06  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-04-24  0.29%  0.23%  -0.06 \n 9  2023-04-13  0.29%  0.29%  -0.01 \n 10  2023-03-31  0.16%  0.29%  +0.14 \n 11  2023-03-20  0.20%  0.16%  -0.04 \n 12  2023-03-07  2.84%  0.20%  -2.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/security/advisories/GHSA-2qc5-385m-x862", "ref_desc": "Potential buffer overflow on HUB descriptor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 azure-rtos/usbx \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.10_rel", "ref_desc": "Release Azure RTOS 6.1.10 \u00b7 azure-rtos/usbx \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
