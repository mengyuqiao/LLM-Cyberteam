{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29218", "Description": "RubyGems is a package registry used to supply software for the Ruby language ecosystem. An ordering mistake in the code that accepts gem uploads allowed some gems (with platforms ending in numbers, like `arm64-darwin-21`) to be temporarily replaced in the CDN cache by a malicious package. The bug has been patched, and is believed to have never been exploited, based on an extensive review of logs and existing gems by rubygems. The easiest way to ensure that an application has not been exploited by this vulnerability is to verify all downloaded .gems checksums match the checksum recorded in the RubyGems.org database. RubyGems.org has been patched and is no longer vulnerable to this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29218", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRubygems\u00bbRubygems.org\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:rubygems:rubygems.org:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-12-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-03  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-04-12  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220629-0010/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-29218 RubyGems Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/security/advisories/GHSA-2jmx-8mh8-pm8w", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized takeover for new versions of some platform-specific gems \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rubygems/rubygems.org \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
