{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-25762", "Description": "If a web application sends a WebSocket message concurrently with the WebSocket connection closing when running on Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.75 or Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20, it is possible that the application will continue to use the socket after it has been closed. The error handling triggered in this case could cause the a pooled object to be placed in the pool twice. This could result in subsequent connections using the same object concurrently which could result in data being returned to the wrong use and/or other errors.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25762", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbTomcatVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.0.21cpe:2.3:a:apache:tomcat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbTomcatVersions  from including (>=) 8.5.0andbefore (<) 8.5.76cpe:2.3:a:apache:tomcat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOracle\u00bbAgile Plm\u00bbVersion:9.3.6cpe:2.3:a:oracle:agile_plm:9.3.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.61%  0.22%  -0.39 \n 2  2023-12-04  0.86%  0.61%  -0.25 \n 3  2023-10-24  0.62%  0.86%  +0.23 \n 4  2023-09-27  0.62%  0.62%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-15  0.63%  0.62%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-05-20  0.28%  0.63%  +0.35 \n 7  2023-05-09  0.20%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.20%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/6ckmjfb1k61dyzkto9vm2k5jvt4o7w7c", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] CVE-2022-25762 Apache Tomcat - Request Mix-up-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220629-0003/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-25762 Apache Tomcat Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/z0T4vZZMJxuRWtccNkz5b23_D-0.html"}]}
