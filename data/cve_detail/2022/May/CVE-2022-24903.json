{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24903", "Description": "Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24903", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRsyslog\u00bbRsyslogVersions  before (<) 8.2204.1cpe:2.3:a:rsyslog:rsyslog:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbActive Iq Unified Manager\u00bbVersion:N/AForVmware Vspherecpe:2.3:a:netapp:active_iq_unified_manager:-:*:*:*:*:vmware_vsphere:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "13.98% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  23.83%  13.98%  -9.86 \n 2  2024-12-09  21.82%  23.83%  +2.02 \n 3  2024-11-13  19.10%  21.82%  +2.72 \n 4  2024-07-27  10.74%  19.10%  +8.36 \n 5  2023-12-25  5.74%  10.74%  +5.00 \n 6  2023-12-11  4.91%  5.74%  +0.83 \n 7  2023-11-26  4.59%  4.91%  +0.32 \n 8  2023-11-08  4.92%  4.59%  -0.33 \n 9  2023-10-16  4.25%  4.92%  +0.67 \n 10  2023-08-10  3.65%  4.25%  +0.60 \n 11  2023-06-07  3.34%  3.65%  +0.31 \n 12  2023-05-12  1.86%  3.34%  +1.49 \n 13  2023-05-08  1.46%  1.86%  +0.39 \n 14  2023-04-17  1.56%  1.46%  -0.09 \n 15  2023-04-05  1.50%  1.56%  +0.06 \n 16  2023-03-07  6.73%  1.50%  -5.23 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5150", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5150-1 rsyslogThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/security/advisories/GHSA-ggw7-xr6h-mmr8", "ref_desc": "Potential heap buffer overflow in TCP syslog server (receiver) components \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rsyslog/rsyslog \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00028.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3016-1] rsyslog security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/I2ElopJxzeVfHf014GcYEnBtst4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221111-0002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-24903 Rsyslog Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/commit/f211042ecbb472f9d8beb4678a65d272b6f07705", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-ggw7-xr6h-mmr8 \u00b7 rsyslog/rsyslog@f211042 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GMNNXLCU2UORRVSZO24HL4KMVPK5PHVW/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: rsyslog-8.2204.0-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
