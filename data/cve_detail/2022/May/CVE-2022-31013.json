{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31013", "Description": "Chat Server is the chat server for Vartalap, an open-source messaging application. Versions 2.3.2 until 2.6.0 suffer from a bug in validating the access token, resulting in authentication bypass. The function `this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey` is an async function, as the code is not using `await` to wait for the verification result. Every time the function responds back with success, along with an unhandled exception if the token is invalid. A patch is available in version 2.6.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31013", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nChat Server Project\u00bbChat ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.2andbefore (<) 2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:chat_server_project:chat_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-09  0.19%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-01-20  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-06  0.16%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-12-22  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-11  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-09-05  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 7  2023-07-03  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-06-07  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-05-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server/discussions/78", "ref_desc": "Authentication security vulnerability \u00b7 Discussion #78 \u00b7 ramank775/chat-server \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server/releases/tag/v2.6.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.6.0 \u00b7 ramank775/chat-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xx4j-qqpp-v277", "ref_desc": "Authentication bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ramank775/chat-server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
