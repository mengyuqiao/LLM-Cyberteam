{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29243", "Description": "Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to versions 22.2.7 and 23.0.4, missing input-size validation of new session names allows users to create app passwords with long names. These long names are then loaded into memory on usage, resulting in impacted performance. Versions 22.2.7 and 23.0.4 contain a fix for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29243", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 22.2.7cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  after (>) 23.0.0andbefore (<) 23.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-12-22  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-09-05  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 4  2023-06-07  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-7cwm-qph5-4h5w", "ref_desc": "Improper input-size validation on the user new session name \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-17) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jZHo9JiHBzcYnpiDroWdMBiDUSQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/31658", "ref_desc": "Limit the length of app password names by nickvergessen \u00b7 Pull Request #31658 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1153138", "ref_desc": "#1153138 Improper input-size validation on the user new session name can result in server-side DDoS.Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
