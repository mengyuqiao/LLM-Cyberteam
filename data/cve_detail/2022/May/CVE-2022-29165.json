{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29165", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. A critical vulnerability has been discovered in Argo CD starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15, 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 which would allow unauthenticated users to impersonate as any Argo CD user or role, including the `admin` user, by sending a specifically crafted JSON Web Token (JWT) along with the request. In order for this vulnerability to be exploited, anonymous access to the Argo CD instance must have been enabled. In a default Argo CD installation, anonymous access is disabled. The vulnerability can be exploited to impersonate as any user or role, including the built-in `admin` account regardless of whether it is enabled or disabled. Also, the attacker does not need an account on the Argo CD instance in order to exploit this. If anonymous access to the instance is enabled, an attacker can escalate their privileges, effectively allowing them to gain the same privileges on the cluster as the Argo CD instance, which is cluster admin in a default installation. This will allow the attacker to create, manipulate and delete any resource on the cluster. They may also exfiltrate data by deploying malicious workloads with elevated privileges, thus bypassing any redaction of sensitive data otherwise enforced by the Argo CD API. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. As a workaround, one may disable anonymous access, but upgrading to a patched version is preferable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29165", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 2.1.15cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.9cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.60%  0.47%  -0.13 \n 2  2024-08-11  0.55%  0.60%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-12-26  0.47%  0.55%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-10-31  0.43%  0.47%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-10-18  0.31%  0.43%  +0.12 \n 6  2023-06-22  0.26%  0.31%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-05-27  0.08%  0.26%  +0.19 \n 8  2023-04-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-r642-gv9p-2wjj", "ref_desc": "Argo CD will trust invalid JWT claims if anonymous access is enabled \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.3.4", "ref_desc": "Release v2.3.4 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GSVobfZhR9QcIEVPWsKNvwLpXSs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.1.15", "ref_desc": "Release v2.1.15 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/onOPdCmxcj0BE5M-KFe3OOqLmSw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.2.9", "ref_desc": "Release v2.2.9 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/t1HnUBpQ6iQgVh1T1enw1qpiZPA.html"}]}
