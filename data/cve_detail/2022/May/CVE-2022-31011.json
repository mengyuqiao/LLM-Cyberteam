{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31011", "Description": "TiDB is an open-source NewSQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. Under certain conditions, an attacker can construct malicious authentication requests to bypass the authentication process, resulting in privilege escalation or unauthorized access. Only users using TiDB 5.3.0 are affected by this vulnerability. TiDB version 5.3.1 contains a patch for this issue. Other mitigation strategies include turning off Security Enhanced Mode (SEM), disabling local login for non-root accounts, and ensuring that the same IP cannot be logged in as root and normal user at the same time.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31011", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPingcap\u00bbTidb\u00bbVersion:5.3.0cpe:2.3:a:pingcap:tidb:5.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-22  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/releases/tag/v5.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release tidb-server v5.3.1 \u00b7 pingcap/tidb \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/security/advisories/GHSA-4whx-7p29-mq22", "ref_desc": "TiDB authentication bypass vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pingcap/tidb \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
