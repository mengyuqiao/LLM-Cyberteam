{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29167", "Description": "Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29167", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMozilla\u00bbHawk\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 9.0.1cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:hawk:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-09  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-11-26  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-12  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/security/advisories/GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq", "ref_desc": "ReDoS vulnerability in header parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mozilla/hawk \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/pull/286", "ref_desc": "Parse URLs using stdlib by lotas \u00b7 Pull Request #286 \u00b7 mozilla/hawk \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
