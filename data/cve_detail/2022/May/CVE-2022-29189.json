{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29189", "Description": "Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security. Prior to version 2.1.4, a buffer that was used for inbound network traffic had no upper limit. Pion DTLS would buffer all network traffic from the remote user until the handshake completes or timed out. An attacker could exploit this to cause excessive memory usage. Version 2.1.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29189", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nPion\u00bbDtlsVersions  before (<) 2.1.4cpe:2.3:a:pion:dtls:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.71% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-12  0.50%  0.71%  +0.21 \n 2  2024-11-28  0.43%  0.50%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-12-11  0.41%  0.43%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-10-31  0.37%  0.41%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-06-22  0.33%  0.37%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-05-27  0.16%  0.33%  +0.17 \n 7  2023-04-20  0.14%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.14%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pion/dtls/security/advisories/GHSA-cx94-mrg9-rq4j", "ref_desc": "Buffer for inbound DTLS fragments has no limit \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pion/dtls \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pion/dtls/commit/a6397ff7282bc56dc37a68ea9211702edb4de1de", "ref_desc": "Add limit to fragmentBuffer \u00b7 pion/dtls@a6397ff \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pion/dtls/releases/tag/v2.1.4", "ref_desc": "Release v2.1.4 \u00b7 pion/dtls \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xuRbro7eRGrZl_G8aLqBMME4eck.html"}]}
