{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24856", "Description": "FlyteConsole is the web user interface for the Flyte platform. FlyteConsole prior to version 0.52.0 is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) when FlyteConsole is open to the general internet. An attacker can exploit any user of a vulnerable instance to access the internal metadata server or other unauthenticated URLs. Passing of headers to an unauthorized actor may occur. The patch for this issue deletes the entire `cors_proxy`, as this is not required for console anymore. A patch is available in FlyteConsole version 0.52.0. Disable FlyteConsole availability on the internet as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24856", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nFlyte\u00bbFlyte ConsoleVersions  before (<) 0.52.0cpe:2.3:a:flyte:flyte_console:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "6.76% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  6.88%  6.76%  -0.13 \n 2  2024-11-25  5.44%  6.88%  +1.45 \n 3  2024-11-12  3.99%  5.44%  +1.45 \n 4  2024-09-05  5.19%  3.99%  -1.20 \n 5  2024-07-10  6.06%  5.19%  -0.87 \n 6  2024-06-26  8.18%  6.06%  -2.12 \n 7  2024-06-12  8.40%  8.18%  -0.22 \n 8  2024-02-04  7.55%  8.40%  +0.85 \n 9  2024-01-06  4.14%  7.55%  +3.41 \n 10  2023-12-08  5.66%  4.14%  -1.52 \n 11  2023-11-25  6.39%  5.66%  -0.73 \n 12  2023-10-28  8.04%  6.39%  -1.65 \n 13  2023-10-15  7.93%  8.04%  +0.11 \n 14  2023-10-01  6.12%  7.93%  +1.81 \n 15  2023-09-18  4.75%  6.12%  +1.37 \n 16  2023-08-22  3.71%  4.75%  +1.03 \n 17  2023-08-09  4.25%  3.71%  -0.54 \n 18  2023-06-19  4.03%  4.25%  +0.22 \n 19  2023-06-06  3.64%  4.03%  +0.40 \n 20  2023-05-24  3.20%  3.64%  +0.43 \n 21  2023-04-29  2.98%  3.20%  +0.22 \n 22  2023-04-17  3.15%  2.98%  -0.17 \n 23  2023-04-06  2.92%  3.15%  +0.23 \n 24  2023-03-13  2.91%  2.92%  +0.02 \n 25  2023-03-07  1.02%  2.91%  +1.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/security/advisories/GHSA-www6-hf2v-v9m9", "ref_desc": "SSRF exploit in flyteconsole \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flyteorg/flyteconsole \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/commit/05b88ed2d2ecdb5d8a8404efea25414e57189709", "ref_desc": "feat: cleanup (#389) \u00b7 flyteorg/flyteconsole@05b88ed \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/pull/389", "ref_desc": "feat: cleanup by ursucarina \u00b7 Pull Request #389 \u00b7 flyteorg/flyteconsole \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/releases/tag/v0.52.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.52.0 \u00b7 flyteorg/flyteconsole \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
