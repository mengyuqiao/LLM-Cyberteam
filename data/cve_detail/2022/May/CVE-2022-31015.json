{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31015", "Description": "Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. Waitress versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 may terminate early due to a thread closing a socket while the main thread is about to call select(). This will lead to the main thread raising an exception that is not handled and then causing the entire application to be killed. This issue has been fixed in Waitress 2.1.2 by no longer allowing the WSGI thread to close the socket. Instead, that is always delegated to the main thread. There is no work-around for this issue. However, users using waitress behind a reverse proxy server are less likely to have issues if the reverse proxy always reads the full response.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31015", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAgendaless\u00bbWaitressVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andbefore (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:agendaless:waitress:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.24%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-08-22  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-01-20  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-12-22  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-11  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-07-03  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-07  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-05-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/377", "ref_desc": "Bugfix: Don't close socket in the WSGI thread, delegate it back to the main thread! by bertjwregeer \u00b7 Pull Request #377 \u00b7 Pylons/waitress \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-f5x9-8jwc-25rw", "ref_desc": "Uncaught Exception (due to a data race) leads to process termination \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Pylons/waitress \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/374", "ref_desc": "Possible race condition leading to the main loop dying? \u00b7 Issue #374 \u00b7 Pylons/waitress \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/4f6789b035610e0552738cdc4b35ca809a592d48", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #377 from Pylons/bugfix/select-closed-socket-race \u00b7 Pylons/waitress@4f6789b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
