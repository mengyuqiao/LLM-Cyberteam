{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29164", "Description": "Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. In affected versions an attacker can create a workflow which produces a HTML artifact containing an HTML file that contains a script which uses XHR calls to interact with the Argo Server API. The attacker emails the deep-link to the artifact to their victim. The victim opens the link, the script starts running. As the script has access to the Argo Server API (as the victim), so may read information about the victim\u2019s workflows, or create and delete workflows. Note the attacker must be an insider: they must have access to the same cluster as the victim and must already be able to run their own workflows. The attacker must have an understanding of the victim\u2019s system. We have seen no evidence of this in the wild. We urge all users to upgrade to the fixed versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29164", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArgo Workflows Project\u00bbArgo Workflows\u00bbForKubernetesVersions  from including (>=) 3.3.0andbefore (<) 3.3.5cpe:2.3:a:argo_workflows_project:argo_workflows:*:*:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*Matching versions\nArgo Workflows Project\u00bbArgo Workflows\u00bbForKubernetesVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 3.2.11cpe:2.3:a:argo_workflows_project:argo_workflows:*:*:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-25  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-11  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-26  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-16  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-12  0.10%  0.19%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-04-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-12  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/8585", "ref_desc": "fix: Added artifact Content-Security-Policy by alexec \u00b7 Pull Request #8585 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-workflows \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/87470e1c2bf703a9110e97bb755614ce8757fdcc", "ref_desc": "fix: Added artifact Content-Security-Policy (#8585) \u00b7 argoproj/argo-workflows@87470e1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-cmv8-6362-r5w9", "ref_desc": "Malicious HTML+XHR Artifact Privilege Escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-workflows \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
