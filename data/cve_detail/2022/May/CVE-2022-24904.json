{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24904", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24904", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.9cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 0.7.0andbefore (<) 2.1.15cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-05  0.11%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-12-11  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 3  2023-05-27  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-04-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/61/UNIX-Symbolic-Link-Symlink-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.3.4", "ref_desc": "Release v2.3.4 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GSVobfZhR9QcIEVPWsKNvwLpXSs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-6gcg-hp2x-q54h", "ref_desc": "Symlink following allows leaking out-of-bound manifests and JSON files from Argo CD repo-server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.1.15", "ref_desc": "Release v2.1.15 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/onOPdCmxcj0BE5M-KFe3OOqLmSw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.2.9", "ref_desc": "Release v2.2.9 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/t1HnUBpQ6iQgVh1T1enw1qpiZPA.html"}]}
