{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29248", "Description": "Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client. Guzzle prior to versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contains a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the server which sets the cookie via the Set-Cookie header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. The cookie middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this issue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with ['cookies' => true] are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability. Guzzle versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, turn off the cookie middleware.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29248", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 9.2.0andbefore (<) 9.2.20cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 9.3.0andbefore (<) 9.3.14cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGuzzlephp\u00bbGuzzleVersions  before (<) 6.5.6cpe:2.3:a:guzzlephp:guzzle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGuzzlephp\u00bbGuzzleVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.4.3cpe:2.3:a:guzzlephp:guzzle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.46%  0.33%  -0.13 \n 2  2024-08-16  0.23%  0.46%  +0.23 \n 3  2023-12-16  0.23%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-11-05  0.18%  0.23%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-08-30  0.13%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-06-01  0.08%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-05-08  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-04-25  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-565 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/565/Reliance-on-Cookies-without-Validation-and-Integrity-Checkin.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/pull/3018", "ref_desc": "[7.x] Fix cross-domain cookie leakage by GrahamCampbell \u00b7 Pull Request #3018 \u00b7 guzzle/guzzle \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/security/advisories/GHSA-cwmx-hcrq-mhc3", "ref_desc": "Cross-domain cookie leakage \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 guzzle/guzzle \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5246", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5246-1 mediawikiThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IZHp6HJTA1DqTLgSaEtESdWEbxY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/commit/74a8602c6faec9ef74b7a9391ac82c5e65b1cdab", "ref_desc": "[7.x] Fix cross-domain cookie leakage (#3018) \u00b7 guzzle/guzzle@74a8602 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2022-010", "ref_desc": "Access to this page has been denied.Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
