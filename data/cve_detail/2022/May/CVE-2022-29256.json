{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29256", "Description": "sharp is an application for Node.js image processing. Prior to version 0.30.5, there is a possible vulnerability in logic that is run only at `npm install` time when installing versions of `sharp` prior to the latest v0.30.5. If an attacker has the ability to set the value of the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable in a build environment then they might be able to use this to inject an arbitrary command at `npm install` time. This is not part of any runtime code, does not affect Windows users at all, and is unlikely to affect anyone that already cares about the security of their build environment. This problem is fixed in version 0.30.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29256", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSharp Project\u00bbSharp\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.30.5cpe:2.3:a:sharp_project:sharp:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/lovell/sharp/commit/a6aeef612be50f5868a77481848b1de674216f0c", "ref_desc": "Install: pass `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` via env rather than substitution \u00b7 lovell/sharp@a6aeef6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lovell/sharp/security/advisories/GHSA-gp95-ppv5-3jc5", "ref_desc": "Possible vulnerability at 'npm install' time if an attacker has control over build environment \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 lovell/sharp \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
