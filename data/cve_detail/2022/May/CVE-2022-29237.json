{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29237", "Description": "Opencast is a free and open source solution for automated video capture and distribution at scale. Prior to Opencast 10.14 and 11.7, users could pass along URLs for files belonging to organizations other than the user's own, which Opencast would then import into the current organization, bypassing organizational barriers. Attackers must have full access to Opencast's ingest REST interface, and also know internal links to resources in another organization of the same Opencast cluster. Users who do not run a multi-tenant cluster are not affected by this issue. This issue is fixed in Opencast 10.14 and 11.7.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29237", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApereo\u00bbOpencastVersions  from including (>=) 11.0andbefore (<) 11.7cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApereo\u00bbOpencastVersions  before (<) 10.14cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-04-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-qm6v-cg9v-53j3", "ref_desc": "Limited Authentication Bypass for Media Files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencast/opencast \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/8d5ec1614eed109b812bc27b0c6d3214e456d4e7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qm6v-cg9v-53j3 \u00b7 opencast/opencast@8d5ec16 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
