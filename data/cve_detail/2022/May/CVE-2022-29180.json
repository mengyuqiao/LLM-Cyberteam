{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29180", "Description": "A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29180", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCharm\u00bbCharmVersions  from including (>=) 0.9.0andbefore (<) 0.12.1cpe:2.3:a:charm:charm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-27  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-17  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-06-08  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-13  0.10%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-04-06  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/commit/3c90668f955c7ce5ef721e4fc9faee7053232fd3", "ref_desc": "fix: clean path before accessing file store \u00b7 charmbracelet/charm@3c90668 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/security/advisories/GHSA-4wpp-w5r4-7v5v", "ref_desc": "Critical Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 charmbracelet/charm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
