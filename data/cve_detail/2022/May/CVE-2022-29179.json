{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29179", "Description": "Cilium is open source software for providing and securing network connectivity and loadbalancing between application workloads. Prior to versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11, and 1.11.15, if an attacker is able to perform a container escape of a container running as root on a host where Cilium is installed, the attacker can escalate privileges to cluster admin by using Cilium's Kubernetes service account. The problem has been fixed and the patch is available in versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11, and 1.11.5. There are no known workarounds available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29179", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.5cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  before (<) 1.9.16cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.11cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-fmrf-gvjp-5j5g", "ref_desc": "User with root privileges on node can leverage permissions of Cilium ClusterRole \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.10.11", "ref_desc": "Release 1.10.11 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QbX1OW8IXf8w3lhuotJaHOlYJI4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.11.5", "ref_desc": "Release 1.11.5 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TbdiQuKft9Fqq49MbUK3GnAYDBU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.9.16", "ref_desc": "Release 1.9.16 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XCj08CNel_PnqT-TdK9_xWhwzUc.html"}]}
