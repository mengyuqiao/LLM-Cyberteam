{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29188", "Description": "Smokescreen is an HTTP proxy. The primary use case for Smokescreen is to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks in which external attackers leverage the behavior of applications to connect to or scan internal infrastructure. Smokescreen also offers an option to deny access to additional (e.g., external) URLs by way of a deny list. There was an issue in Smokescreen that made it possible to bypass the deny list feature by surrounding the hostname with square brackets (e.g. `[example.com]`). This only impacted the HTTP proxy functionality of Smokescreen. HTTPS requests were not impacted. Smokescreen version 0.0.4 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29188", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nStripe\u00bbSmokescreenVersions  before (<) 0.0.4cpe:2.3:a:stripe:smokescreen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-12-11  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-22  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-04-20  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen/commit/dea7b3c89df000f4072ff9866d61d78e30df6a36", "ref_desc": "Fix hostname parsing for square brackets \u00b7 stripe/smokescreen@dea7b3c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen/security/advisories/GHSA-qwrf-gfpj-qvj6", "ref_desc": "Smokescreen SSRF via deny list bypass (square brackets) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 stripe/smokescreen \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
