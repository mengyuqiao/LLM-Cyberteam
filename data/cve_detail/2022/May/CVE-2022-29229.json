{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29229", "Description": "CaSS is a Competency and Skills System. CaSS Library, (npm:cassproject) has a missing cryptographic step when storing cryptographic keys that can allow a server administrator access to an account\u2019s cryptographic keys. This affects CaSS servers using standalone username/password authentication, which uses a method that expects e2e cryptographic security of authorization credentials. The issue has been patched in 1.5.8, however, the vulnerable accounts are only resecured when the user next logs in using standalone authentication, as the data required to resecure the account is not available to the server. The issue may be mitigated by using SSO or client side certificates to log in. Please note that SSO and client side certificate authentication does not have this expectation of no-knowledge credential access, and cryptographic keys are available to the server administrator.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29229", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCassproject\u00bbCompetency And Skills System\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.5.8cpe:2.3:a:cassproject:competency_and_skills_system:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nCassproject\u00bbCompetency And Skills System\u00bbForDockerVersions  before (<) 1.5.8cpe:2.3:a:cassproject:competency_and_skills_system:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-29  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-25  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-04-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-325 Missing Cryptographic Step", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/325/Missing-Cryptographic-Step.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cassproject/CASS/security/advisories/GHSA-7qcx-4p32-qcmx", "ref_desc": "Missing Cryptographic Step in cassproject \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cassproject/CASS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cassproject/CASS/releases/tag/1.5.8", "ref_desc": "Release 1.5.8: Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/dependabot/npm_and_yarn/async-2.\u2026 \u00b7 cassproject/CASS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
