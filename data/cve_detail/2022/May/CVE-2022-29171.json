{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29171", "Description": "Sourcegraph is a fast and featureful code search and navigation engine. Versions before 3.38.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in the gitserver service. The Gitolite code host integration with Phabricator allows Sourcegraph site admins to specify a `callsignCommand`, which is used to obtain the Phabricator metadata for a Gitolite repository. An administrator who is able to edit or add a Gitolite code host and has administrative access to Sourcegraph\u2019s bundled Grafana instance can change this command arbitrarily and run it remotely. This grants direct access to the infrastructure underlying the Sourcegraph installation. The attack requires: site-admin privileges on the instance of Sourcegraph, Administrative privileges on the bundled Grafana monitoring instance, Knowledge of the gitserver IP address or DNS name (if running in Kubernetes). This can be found through Grafana. The issue is patched in version 3.38.0. You may disable Gitolite code hosts. We still highly encourage upgrading regardless of workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29171", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSourcegraph\u00bbSourcegraphVersions  before (<) 3.38.0cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:sourcegraph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.66%  +0.32 \n 2  2024-10-17  0.33%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-27  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-19  0.26%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-12-11  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-26  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-05-12  0.14%  0.22%  +0.08 \n 8  2023-04-05  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-12  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.10%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-r2m9-hfg8-4c38", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution in gitserver \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
