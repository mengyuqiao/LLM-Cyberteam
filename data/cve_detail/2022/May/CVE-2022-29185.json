{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29185", "Description": "totp-rs is a Rust library that permits the creation of 2FA authentification tokens per time-based one-time password (TOTP). Prior to version 1.1.0, token comparison was not constant time, and could theorically be used to guess value of an TOTP token, and thus reuse it in the same time window. The attacker would have to know the password beforehand nonetheless. Starting with patched version 1.1.0, the library uses constant-time comparison. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29185", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTotp-rs Project\u00bbTotp-rs\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:totp-rs_project:totp-rs:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-05  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-12-11  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 4  2023-05-27  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-04-20  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/constantoine/totp-rs/releases/tag/v1.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.1.0 \u00b7 constantoine/totp-rs \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/constantoine/totp-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-8vxv-2g8p-2249", "ref_desc": "Observable Timing Discrepancy in totp-rs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 constantoine/totp-rs \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/constantoine/totp-rs/issues/13", "ref_desc": "Unsafe token check \u00b7 Issue #13 \u00b7 constantoine/totp-rs \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
