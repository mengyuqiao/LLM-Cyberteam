{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29186", "Description": "Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console, command line tools and a WebAPI. Rundeck community and rundeck-enterprise docker images contained a pre-generated SSH keypair. If the id_rsa.pub public key of the keypair was copied to authorized_keys files on remote host, those hosts would allow access to anyone with the exposed private credentials. This misconfiguration only impacts Rundeck Docker instances of PagerDuty\u00c2\u00ae Process Automation On Prem (formerly Rundeck) version 4.0 and earlier, not Debian, RPM or .WAR. Additionally, the id_rsa.pub file would have to be copied from the Docker image filesystem contents without overwriting it and used to configure SSH access on a host. A patch on Rundeck's `main` branch has removed the pre-generated SSH key pair, but it does not remove exposed keys that have been configured. To patch, users must run a script on hosts in their environment to search for exposed keys and rotate them. Two workarounds are available: Do not use any pre-existing public key file from the rundeck docker images to allow SSH access by adding it to authorized_keys files and, if you have copied the public key file included in the docker image, remove it from any authorized_keys files.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29186", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPagerduty\u00bbRundeck\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 4.1.0cpe:2.3:a:pagerduty:rundeck:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nPagerduty\u00bbRundeck\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  before (<) 4.1.0cpe:2.3:a:pagerduty:rundeck:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-11  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-22  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-27  0.11%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-04-20  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/security/advisories/GHSA-qxjx-xr2m-hgqx", "ref_desc": "Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key in rundeck/rundeck, rundeckpro/enterprise \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rundeck/rundeck \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/commit/16ef7a70b202492f9fbb54d8af4bb8ea0afa10ad", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qxjx-xr2m-hgqx \u00b7 rundeck/rundeck@16ef7a7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
