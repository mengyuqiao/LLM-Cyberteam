{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31007", "Description": "eLabFTW is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. Prior to version 4.3.0, a vulnerability allows an authenticated user with an administrator role in a team to assign itself system administrator privileges within the application, or create a new system administrator account. The issue has been corrected in eLabFTW version 4.3.0. In the context of eLabFTW, an administrator is a user account with certain privileges to manage users and content in their assigned team/teams. A system administrator account can manage all accounts, teams and edit system-wide settings within the application. The impact is not deemed as high, as it requires the attacker to have access to an administrator account. Regular user accounts cannot exploit this to gain admin rights. A workaround for one if the issues is removing the ability of administrators to create accounts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31007", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nElabftw\u00bbElabftwVersions  before (<) 4.3.0cpe:2.3:a:elabftw:elabftw:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-22  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-11  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-07  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  9.03%  0.05%  -8.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-842 Placement of User into Incorrect Group", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/842/Placement-of-User-into-Incorrect-Group.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1287 Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1287/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Type-of-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/security/advisories/GHSA-937c-m7p3-775v", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation from administrator in eLabFTW \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/4.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release elabftw-4.3.0 \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
