{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29178", "Description": "Cilium is open source software for providing and securing network connectivity and loadbalancing between application workloads. Cilium prior to versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11, and 1.11.15 contains an incorrect default permissions vulnerability. Operating Systems with users belonging to the group ID 1000 can access the API of Cilium via Unix domain socket available on the host where Cilium is running. This could allow malicious users to compromise integrity as well as system availability on that host. The problem has been fixed and the patch is available in versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11, and 1.11.5. A potential workaround is to modify Cilium's DaemonSet to run with a certain command, which can be found in the GitHub Security Advisory for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29178", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.5cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  before (<) 1.9.16cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.11cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-6p8v-8cq8-v2r3", "ref_desc": "Cilium grants access to per node API to users with hostfs and group ID 1000 privileges \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.10.11", "ref_desc": "Release 1.10.11 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QbX1OW8IXf8w3lhuotJaHOlYJI4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.11.5", "ref_desc": "Release 1.11.5 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TbdiQuKft9Fqq49MbUK3GnAYDBU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.9.16", "ref_desc": "Release 1.9.16 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XCj08CNel_PnqT-TdK9_xWhwzUc.html"}]}
