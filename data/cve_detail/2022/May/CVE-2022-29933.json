{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29933", "Description": "Craft CMS through 3.7.36 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker, who knows at least one valid username, to reset the account's password and take over the account by providing a crafted HTTP header to the application while using the password reset functionality. Specifically, the attacker must send X-Forwarded-Host to the /index.php?p=admin/actions/users/send-password-reset-email URI. NOTE: the vendor's position is that a customer can already work around this by adjusting the configuration (i.e., by not using the default configuration).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29933", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft CmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.7.36cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.56%  0.22%  -0.35 \n 2  2024-12-13  0.64%  0.56%  -0.07 \n 3  2024-12-02  0.65%  0.64%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-07-31  0.70%  0.65%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-12-29  0.49%  0.70%  +0.21 \n 6  2023-12-15  0.35%  0.49%  +0.15 \n 7  2023-11-30  0.29%  0.35%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-05-29  0.31%  0.29%  -0.02 \n 9  2023-05-16  0.25%  0.31%  +0.07 \n 10  2023-04-09  0.29%  0.25%  -0.04 \n 11  2023-03-29  0.20%  0.29%  +0.09 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.21%  0.20%  -1.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md", "ref_desc": "cms/CHANGELOG.md at develop \u00b7 craftcms/cms \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166989/Craft-CMS-3.7.36-Password-Reset-Poisoning-Attack.html", "ref_desc": "Craft CMS 3.7.36 Password Reset Poisoning Attack \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/password-reset-poisoning-attack-craft-cms/", "ref_desc": "Password Reset Poisoning Attack in Craft CMSExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability Lab - SEC ConsultThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yJfU8ODXPcfptGTlhH3HqBkGOv8.html"}]}
