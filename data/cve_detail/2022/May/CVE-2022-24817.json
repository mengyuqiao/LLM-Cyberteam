{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24817", "Description": "Flux2 is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0, helm-controller 0.1.0 to v0.19.0, and kustomize-controller 0.1.0 to v0.23.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig. In multi-tenancy deployments this can also lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service account has elevated permissions. Workarounds include disabling functionality via Validating Admission webhooks by restricting users from setting the `spec.kubeConfig` field in Flux `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` objects. Additional mitigations include applying restrictive AppArmor and SELinux profiles on the controller\u2019s pod to limit what binaries can be executed. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.23.0 and helm-controller v0.19.0, both included in flux2 v0.29.0", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24817", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFluxcd\u00bbKustomize-controllerVersions  from including (>=) 0.1.0andbefore (<) 0.23.0cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:kustomize-controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFluxcd\u00bbFlux2Versions  from including (>=) 0.1.0andbefore (<) 0.29.0cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:flux2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFluxcd\u00bbHelm-controllerVersions  from including (>=) 0.2.0andbefore (<) 0.19.0cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:helm-controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-26  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-16  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-12  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-04-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-vvmq-fwmg-2gjc", "ref_desc": "Improper kubeconfig validation allows arbitrary code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fluxcd/flux2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
