{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31261", "Description": "An XXE issue was discovered in Morpheus through 5.2.16 and 5.4.x through 5.4.4. A successful attack requires a SAML identity provider to be configured. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must know the unique SAML callback ID of the configured identity source. A remote attacker can send a request crafted with an XXE payload to invoke a malicious DTD hosted on a system that they control. This results in reading local files that the application has access to.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31261", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nMorpheusdata\u00bbMorpheusVersions  from including (>=) 5.4.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.4.4cpe:2.3:a:morpheusdata:morpheus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMorpheusdata\u00bbMorpheusVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.2.16cpe:2.3:a:morpheusdata:morpheus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-15  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-08  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-30  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-12-15  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-05  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-26  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-05-31  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-04-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.morpheusdata.com/s/?language=en_US", "ref_desc": "HomeNot Applicable;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/5.4.4/release_notes/current.html", "ref_desc": "v5.4.4 Release Notes \u2014 Morpheus Docs documentationRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
