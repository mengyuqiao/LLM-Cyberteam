{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29177", "Description": "Go Ethereum is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol. Prior to version 1.10.17, a vulnerable node, if configured to use high verbosity logging, can be made to crash when handling specially crafted p2p messages sent from an attacker node. Version 1.10.17 contains a patch that addresses the problem. As a workaround, setting loglevel to default level (`INFO`) makes the node not vulnerable to this attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29177", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEthereum\u00bbGo EthereumVersions  before (<) 1.10.17cpe:2.3:a:ethereum:go_ethereum:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-11  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-31  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-04-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24507", "ref_desc": "p2p: define DiscReason as uint8 by fjl \u00b7 Pull Request #24507 \u00b7 ethereum/go-ethereum \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-wjxw-gh3m-7pm5", "ref_desc": "DoS via malicious p2p message \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ethereum/go-ethereum \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
