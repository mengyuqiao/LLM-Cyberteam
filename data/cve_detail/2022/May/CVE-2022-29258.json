{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29258", "Description": "XWiki Platform Filter UI provides a generic user interface to convert from a XWiki Filter input stream to an output stream with settings for each stream. Starting with versions 6.0-milestone-2 and 5.4.4 and prior to versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3, XWiki Platform Filter UI contains a possible cross-site scripting vector in the `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm` wiki page related to pretty much all the form fields printed in the home page of the application. The issue is patched in versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3. The easiest workaround is to edit the wiki page `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm` (with wiki editor) according to the instructions in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29258", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 13.5andbefore (<) 13.10.3cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 13.0andbefore (<) 13.4.7cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 5.4.4andbefore (<) 12.10.11cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-09  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-22  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-11  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-07  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-05-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-xjfw-5vv5-vjq2", "ref_desc": "XSS in Filter Stream Converter Application \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19293", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19293] XSS in Filter Stream Converter Application - XWiki.org JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/21906acb5ee2304552f56f9bbdbf8e7d368f7f3a", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19293: Fix bad escaping \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@21906ac \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
