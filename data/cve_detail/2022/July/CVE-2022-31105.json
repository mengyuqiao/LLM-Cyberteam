{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31105", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.4.0 and prior to 2.2.11, 2.3.6, and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to an improper certificate validation bug which could cause Argo CD to trust a malicious (or otherwise untrustworthy) OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.4.5, 2.3.6, and 2.2.11. There are no complete workarounds, but a partial workaround is available. Those who use an external OIDC provider (not the bundled Dex instance), can mitigate the issue by setting the `oidc.config.rootCA` field in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. This mitigation only forces certificate validation when the API server handles login flows. It does not force certificate verification when verifying tokens on API calls.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31105", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbArgo-cdVersions  from including (>=) 0.4.0andbefore (<) 2.2.11cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo-cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.5cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.6cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-02  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-02  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-23  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-14  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-07-19  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-06-12  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-599 Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/599/Missing-Validation-of-OpenSSL-Certificate.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.3.6", "ref_desc": "Release v2.3.6 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dWVGzpbrcHcjVkoSqrn8aZNawPI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.4.5", "ref_desc": "Release v2.4.5 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PwWmbdotuG7QzGlJrFHTzc8sGko.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-7943-82jg-wmw5", "ref_desc": "Certificate verification is skipped for connections to OIDC providers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
