{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24800", "Description": "October/System is the system module for October CMS, a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.476, 1.1.12, and 2.2.15, when the developer allows the user to specify their own filename in the `fromData` method, an unauthenticated user can perform remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting a race condition in the temporary storage directory. This vulnerability affects plugins that expose the `October\\Rain\\Database\\Attach\\File::fromData` as a public interface and does not affect vanilla installations of October CMS since this method is not exposed or used by the system internally or externally. The issue has been patched in Build 476 (v1.0.476), v1.1.12, and v2.2.15. Those who are unable to upgrade may apply with patch to their installation manually as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24800", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 1.1.12cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  before (<) 1.0.476cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.15cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-26  0.41%  0.42%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-02  0.38%  0.41%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-23  0.39%  0.38%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-08-14  0.34%  0.39%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-07-19  0.24%  0.34%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-06-12  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.22%  -1.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-8v7h-cpc2-r8jp", "ref_desc": "RCE via race condition in upload process \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/fe569f3babf3f593be2b1e0a4ae0283506127a83", "ref_desc": "Refactor \u00b7 octobercms/library@fe569f3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
