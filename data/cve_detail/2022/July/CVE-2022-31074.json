{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31074", "Description": "KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud AdmissionController will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There is currently no known workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31074", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  before (<) 1.9.4cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.2cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-02-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-18  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-w52j-3457-q9wr", "ref_desc": "Cloud AdmissionController component: DoS by exhausting memory of node with http request containing large body \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
