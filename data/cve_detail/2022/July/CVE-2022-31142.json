{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31142", "Description": "@fastify/bearer-auth is a Fastify plugin to require bearer Authorization headers. @fastify/bearer-auth prior to versions 7.0.2 and 8.0.1 does not securely use crypto.timingSafeEqual. A malicious attacker could estimate the length of one valid bearer token. According to the corresponding RFC 6750, the bearer token has only base64 valid characters, reducing the range of characters for a brute force attack. Version 7.0.2 and 8.0.1 of @fastify/bearer-auth contain a patch. There are currently no known workarounds. The package fastify-bearer-auth, which covers versions 6.0.3 and prior, is also vulnerable starting at version 5.0.1. Users of fastify-bearer-auth should upgrade to a patched version of @fastify/bearer-auth.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31142", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFastify\u00bbBearer-auth\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.1andbefore (<) 7.0.2cpe:2.3:a:fastify:bearer-auth:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nFastify\u00bbBearer-auth\u00bbVersion:8.0.0ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:fastify:bearer-auth:8.0.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-04  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 2  2023-12-25  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-10-19  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-16  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-21  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-06-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1633287", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-bearer-auth/commit/0c468a616d7e56126dc468150f6a5a92e530b8e4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-376v-xgjx-7mfr \u00b7 fastify/fastify-bearer-auth@0c468a6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-bearer-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-376v-xgjx-7mfr", "ref_desc": "Potential Timing Attack Vector in fastify-bearer-auth \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fastify/fastify-bearer-auth \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-bearer-auth/commit/f921a0582dc83112039004a9b5041141b50c5b3f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-376v-xgjx-7mfr \u00b7 fastify/fastify-bearer-auth@f921a05 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-bearer-auth/commit/39353b15409ee99474545f615ffb16180cf3b716", "ref_desc": "Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` instead of `secure-compare` module (#40) \u00b7 fastify/fastify-bearer-auth@39353b1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
