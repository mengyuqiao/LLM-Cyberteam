{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31163", "Description": "TZInfo is a Ruby library that provides access to time zone data and allows times to be converted using time zone rules. Versions prior to 0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the Ruby data source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby process. Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path. Applications should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a directory on the load path. As a workaround, the time zone identifier can be validated before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it matches the regular expression `\\A[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+(?:\\/[A-Za-z0-9+\\-_]+)*\\z`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31163", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTzinfo Project\u00bbTzinfoVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.2.10cpe:2.3:a:tzinfo_project:tzinfo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTzinfo Project\u00bbTzinfoVersions  before (<) 0.3.61cpe:2.3:a:tzinfo_project:tzinfo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.30%  -0.07 \n 2  2024-10-12  0.28%  0.36%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-03-11  0.26%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-26  0.26%  0.26%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-02-11  0.26%  0.26%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-01-01  0.20%  0.26%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-10-26  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-08-23  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-07-28  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-06-21  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.09%  -1.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo/releases/tag/v0.3.61", "ref_desc": "Release v0.3.61 \u00b7 tzinfo/tzinfo \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/08/msg00009.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3077-1] ruby-tzinfo security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo/releases/tag/v1.2.10", "ref_desc": "Release v1.2.10 \u00b7 tzinfo/tzinfo \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo/commit/9905ca93abf7bf3e387bd592406e403cd18334c7", "ref_desc": "Fix directory traversal in Timezone.get when using Ruby data source \u00b7 tzinfo/tzinfo@9905ca9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo/commit/9eddbb5c0e682736f61d0dd803b6031a5db9eadf", "ref_desc": "Fix directory traversal in Timezone.get \u00b7 tzinfo/tzinfo@9eddbb5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo/security/advisories/GHSA-5cm2-9h8c-rvfx", "ref_desc": "Relative path traversal vulnerability allows TZInfo::Timezone.get to load arbitrary files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tzinfo/tzinfo \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
