{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24688", "Description": "An issue was discovered in DSK DSKNet 2.16.136.0 and 2.17.136.5. The Touch settings allow unrestricted file upload (and consequently Remote Code Execution) via PDF upload with PHP content and a .php extension. The attacker must hijack or obtain privileged user access to the Parameters page in order to exploit this issue. (That can be easily achieved by exploiting the Broken Access Control with further Brute-force attack or SQL Injection.) The uploaded file is stored within the database and copied to the sync web folder if the attacker visits a certain .php?action= page.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24688", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDSK\u00bbDsknet\u00bbVersion:2.17.136.5cpe:2.3:a:dsk:dsknet:2.17.136.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDSK\u00bbDsknet\u00bbVersion:2.16.136.0cpe:2.3:a:dsk:dsknet:2.16.136.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.86% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.25%  0.86%  -0.39 \n 2  2024-07-02  0.89%  1.25%  +0.37 \n 3  2024-05-06  0.63%  0.89%  +0.26 \n 4  2024-04-06  0.08%  0.63%  +0.55 \n 5  2024-03-22  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-02-08  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 7  2023-07-25  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-06-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  2.43%  0.05%  -2.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://dsk.lu/fr/produits/temps-de-presence", "ref_desc": "DSK SystemsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/igNbHDMfJz97y2fERqfZ2i-xUZQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/post-cyberlabs/CVE-Advisory/blob/main/CVE-2022-24688-92.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVE-Advisory/CVE-2022-24688-92.pdf at main \u00b7 post-cyberlabs/CVE-Advisory \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rdDSv9L2si4Zg-qq1gDoFc2wGDE.html"}]}
