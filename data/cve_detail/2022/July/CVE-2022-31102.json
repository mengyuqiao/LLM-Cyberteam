{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31102", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31102", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.5cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.6cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-02  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-14  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-19  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-06-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-pmjg-52h9-72qv", "ref_desc": "A leaked API server encryption key can allow XSS for SSO users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.3.6", "ref_desc": "Release v2.3.6 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dWVGzpbrcHcjVkoSqrn8aZNawPI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.4.5", "ref_desc": "Release v2.4.5 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PwWmbdotuG7QzGlJrFHTzc8sGko.html"}]}
