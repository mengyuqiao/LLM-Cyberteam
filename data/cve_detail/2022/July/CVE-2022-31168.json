{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31168", "Description": "Zulip is an open source team chat tool. Due to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and earlier, a member of an organization could craft an API call that grants organization administrator privileges to one of their bots. The vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.5. Members who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t own any bots, and lack permission to create them, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exploit the vulnerability. As a workaround for the vulnerability, an organization administrator can restrict the `Who can create bots` permission to administrators only, and change the ownership of existing bots.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31168", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulipVersions  before (<) 5.5cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-12  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-27  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-12  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-02  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-29  0.08%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-06-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-29  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-c3cp-ggg5-9xw5", "ref_desc": "Insufficient authorization check for changing bot roles in Zulip Server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/751b2a03e565e9eb02ffe923b7c24ac73d604034", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-31168: Fix authorization check for changing bot roles. \u00b7 zulip/zulip@751b2a0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/releases/tag/5.5", "ref_desc": "Release Zulip Server 5.5 \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
