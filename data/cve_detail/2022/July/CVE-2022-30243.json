{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30243", "Description": "Honeywell Alerton Visual Logic through 2022-05-04 allows unauthenticated programming writes from remote users. This enables code to be stored on the controller and then run without verification. A user with malicious intent can send a crafted packet to change and/or stop the program without the knowledge of other users, altering the controller's function. After the programming change, the program needs to be overwritten in order for the controller to restore its original operational function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30243", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nHoneywell\u00bbAlterton Visual Logic FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2022-05-04cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:alterton_visual_logic_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Honeywell\u00bbAlterton Visual Logic\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-31  0.20%  0.17%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-02-20  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-05  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-07-22  0.09%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-06-15  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.scadafence.com", "ref_desc": "SCADAfence BlogNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Fzlsi1BNBMnuZRF8wp3YDLFTIqg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/scadafence/Honeywell-Alerton-Vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "GitHub - scadafence/Honeywell-Alerton-Vulnerabilities: Alerton Ascent Control Module (ACM) & Alerton Visual Logic vulnerabilitiesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/P5FJjGVbB8Lmm8hnkRpNNqU40Dw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/product-security", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TCUmUVgCxyb_UcZzlBChRCIGeB4.html"}]}
