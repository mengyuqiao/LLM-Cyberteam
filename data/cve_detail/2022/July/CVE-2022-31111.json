{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31111", "Description": "Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. In affected versions the truncation done when converting between EVM balance type and Substrate balance type was incorrectly implemented. This leads to possible discrepancy between appeared EVM transfer value and actual Substrate value transferred. It is recommended that an emergency upgrade to be planned and EVM execution temporarily paused in the mean time. The issue is patched in Frontier master branch commit fed5e0a9577c10bea021721e8c2c5c378e16bf66 and polkadot-v0.9.22 branch commit e3e427fa2e5d1200a784679f8015d4774cedc934. This vulnerability affects only EVM internal states, but not Substrate balance states or node. You can temporarily pause EVM execution (by setting up a Substrate `CallFilter` that disables `pallet-evm` and `pallet-ethereum` calls before the patch can be applied.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31111", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nParity\u00bbFrontier\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:parity:frontier:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-24  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-25  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-25  0.08%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-27  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-12-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-13  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-06-06  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.06%  -2.45 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/commit/e3e427fa2e5d1200a784679f8015d4774cedc934", "ref_desc": "Limit number of iterations in genesis nonce building (#753) \u00b7 paritytech/frontier@e3e427f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/commit/fed5e0a9577c10bea021721e8c2c5c378e16bf66", "ref_desc": "Limit number of iterations in genesis nonce building (#753) \u00b7 paritytech/frontier@fed5e0a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/753", "ref_desc": "Fix incorrect truncation of low_u128/low_u64 by sorpaas \u00b7 Pull Request #753 \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/security/advisories/GHSA-hc8w-mx86-9fcj", "ref_desc": "Discrepency between appeared EVM transfer value and actual value due to incorrect truncation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
