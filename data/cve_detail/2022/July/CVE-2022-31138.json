{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31138", "Description": "mailcow is a mailserver suite. Prior to mailcow-dockerized version 2022-06a, an extended privilege vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the custom parameters regexmess, skipmess, regexflag, delete2foldersonly, delete2foldersbutnot, regextrans2, pipemess, or maxlinelengthcmd to execute arbitrary code. Users should update their mailcow instances with the `update.sh` script in the mailcow root directory to 2022-06a or newer to receive a patch for this issue. As a temporary workaround, the Syncjob ACL can be removed from all mailbox users, preventing changes to those settings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31138", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMailcow\u00bbMailcow: DockerizedVersions  before (<) 2022-06acpe:2.3:a:mailcow:mailcow\\:_dockerized:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  1.21%  +0.90 \n 2  2024-10-02  0.27%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-03-30  0.27%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-01  0.17%  0.27%  +0.10 \n 5  2024-02-16  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-02-01  0.16%  0.14%  -0.02 \n 7  2024-01-19  0.20%  0.16%  -0.04 \n 8  2023-12-09  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-11-12  0.21%  0.18%  -0.03 \n 10  2023-07-18  0.14%  0.21%  +0.07 \n 11  2023-06-23  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-06-11  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 13  2023-03-23  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 14  2023-03-07  27.31%  0.08%  -27.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/commit/d373164e13a14e058f82c9f1918a5612f375a9f9", "ref_desc": "hotfix imapsync \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized@d373164 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-vx9w-h33p-5vhc", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-31138: IMAPSYNC (Syncjobs) Debug Extended Rights (hidden options) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2022-06a", "ref_desc": "Release \ud83c\udf15\ud83d\udc04 Moone Update 2022 - The (now fully) Docker Compose v2 Update | Revision A \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ly1g3/Mailcow-CVE-2022-31138", "ref_desc": "GitHub - ly1g3/Mailcow-CVE-2022-31138: Mailcow CVE-2022-31138Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
