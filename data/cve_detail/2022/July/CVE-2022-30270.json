{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30270", "Description": "The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 has default credentials. It exposes an SSH interface on port 22/TCP. This interface is used for remote maintenance and for SFTP file-transfer operations that are part of engineering software functionality. Access to this interface is controlled by 5 preconfigured accounts (root, abuilder, acelogin, cappl, ace), all of which come with default credentials. Although the ACE1000 documentation mentions the root, abuilder and acelogin accounts and instructs users to change the default credentials, the cappl and ace accounts remain undocumented and thus are unlikely to have their credentials changed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30270", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMotorola\u00bbAce1000 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:motorola:ace1000_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Motorola\u00bbAce1000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.27%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-06  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-28  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-02  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-26  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-179-06", "ref_desc": "Motorola Solutions ACE1000 | CISAMitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Oazv3kD1K4KSpcWxkKS3NpK-X3E.html"}]}
