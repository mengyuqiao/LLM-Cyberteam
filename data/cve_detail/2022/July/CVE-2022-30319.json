{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30319", "Description": "Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 allows Authentication bypass. According to FSCT-2022-0062, there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus authentication bypass issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication functions on the basis of a MAC/IP whitelist with inactivity timeout to which an authenticated client's MAC/IP is stored. UDP traffic can be spoofed to bypass the whitelist-based access control. Since UDP is stateless, an attacker capable of passively observing traffic can spoof arbitrary messages using the MAC/IP of an authenticated client. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30319", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHoneywell\u00bbSaia Pg5 Controls Suite\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:honeywell:saia_pg5_controls_suite:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-09  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-01-08  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2023-08-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-207-03", "ref_desc": "Honeywell Saia Burgess PG5 PCD | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/b7mQlm-4NpNbbjXrUekUBrqNsvA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}]}
