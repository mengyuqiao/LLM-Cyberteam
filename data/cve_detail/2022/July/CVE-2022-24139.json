{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24139", "Description": "In IOBit Advanced System Care (AscService.exe) 15, an attacker with SEImpersonatePrivilege can create a named pipe with the same name as one of ASCService's named pipes. ASCService first tries to connect before trying to create the named pipes, because of that during login the service will try to connect to the attacker which will lead to either escalation of privileges (through token manipulation and ImpersonateNamedPipeClient() ) from ADMIN -> SYSTEM or from Local ADMIN-> Domain ADMIN depending on the user and named pipe that is used.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24139", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIobit\u00bbAdvanced System Care\u00bbVersion:15    PROEditioncpe:2.3:a:iobit:advanced_system_care:15:*:*:*:pro:*:*:*Matching versions\nIobit\u00bbAdvanced System Care\u00bbVersion:15    FreeEditioncpe:2.3:a:iobit:advanced_system_care:15:*:*:*:free:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-27  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tomerpeled92/CVE/", "ref_desc": "GitHub - tomerpeled92/CVEThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/17HNnYE2w7fenx3Lr-TKqkvZfPE.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://advanced.com", "ref_desc": "Advanced Interconnections | Interconnect SolutionsNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CBz9V-p2-rsPIQWE14CBQzAZhGU.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://iobit.com", "ref_desc": "Macbooster \u00ae Official Site - Download MacBooster 8 - Enjoy a Faster and More Secure MacVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/y5y-l7Qmtru8lgyiD76gs1NG2J8.html"}]}
