{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31145", "Description": "FlyteAdmin is the control plane for Flyte responsible for managing entities and administering workflow executions. In versions 1.1.30 and prior, authenticated users using an external identity provider can continue to use Access Tokens and ID Tokens even after they expire. Users who use FlyteAdmin as the OAuth2 Authorization Server are unaffected by this issue. A patch is available on the `master` branch of the repository. As a workaround, rotating signing keys immediately will invalidate all open sessions and force all users to attempt to obtain new tokens. Those who use this workaround should continue to rotate keys until FlyteAdmin has been upgraded and hide FlyteAdmin deployment ingress URL from the internet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31145", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFlyte\u00bbFlyteadminVersions  before (<) 1.1.31cpe:2.3:a:flyte:flyteadmin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-01  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-03  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-03  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 6  2023-07-20  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-06-13  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.06%  -2.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/pull/455", "ref_desc": "Fix verification logic by EngHabu \u00b7 Pull Request #455 \u00b7 flyteorg/flyteadmin \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/security/advisories/GHSA-qwrj-9hmp-gpxh", "ref_desc": "Insufficient AccessToken Expiration Check \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flyteorg/flyteadmin \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/commit/a1ec282d02706e074bc4986fd0412e5da3b9d00a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qwrj-9hmp-gpxh \u00b7 flyteorg/flyteadmin@a1ec282 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
