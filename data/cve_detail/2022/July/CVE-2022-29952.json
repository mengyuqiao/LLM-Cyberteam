{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-29952", "Description": "Bently Nevada condition monitoring equipment through 2022-04-29 mishandles authentication. It utilizes the TDI command and data protocols (60005/TCP, 60007/TCP) for communications between the monitoring controller and System 1 and/or Bently Nevada Monitor Configuration (BNMC) software. These protocols provide configuration management and historical data related functionality. Neither protocol has any authentication features, allowing any attacker capable of communicating with the ports in question to invoke (a subset of) desired functionality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29952", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBakerhughes\u00bbBently Nevada 3701/40 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.1cpe:2.3:o:bakerhughes:bently_nevada_3701\\/40_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Bakerhughes\u00bbBently Nevada 3701/40\u00bbVersion:N/A\nBakerhughes\u00bbBently Nevada 3701/44 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.1cpe:2.3:o:bakerhughes:bently_nevada_3701\\/44_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Bakerhughes\u00bbBently Nevada 3701/44\u00bbVersion:N/A\nBakerhughes\u00bbBently Nevada 3701/46 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.1cpe:2.3:o:bakerhughes:bently_nevada_3701\\/46_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Bakerhughes\u00bbBently Nevada 3701/46\u00bbVersion:N/A\nBakerhughes\u00bbBently Nevada 60m100 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:bakerhughes:bently_nevada_60m100_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Bakerhughes\u00bbBently Nevada 60m100\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-08-28  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-02  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-188-02", "ref_desc": "Bently Nevada ADAPT 3701/4X Series and 60M100 | CISAMitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/z7D-Gwa-NAlsTfdXhgn8XKImO4E.html"}]}
