{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31073", "Description": "KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus server on the edge side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service. Malicious apps accidentally pulled by users on the host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31073", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  before (<) 1.9.4cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.2cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.21%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-02  0.16%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-03-01  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-02-16  0.11%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-01  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-12-22  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-08-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-07-18  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-06-11  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/4042", "ref_desc": "Cherry-pick GHSA-vwm6-qc77-v2rh: fix invalid request by kevin-wangzefeng \u00b7 Pull Request #4042 \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/4039", "ref_desc": "Cherry-pick GHSA-vwm6-qc77-v2rh: fix invalid request by kevin-wangzefeng \u00b7 Pull Request #4039 \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/4038", "ref_desc": "Cherry-pick GHSA-vwm6-qc77-v2rh: fix invalid request by kevin-wangzefeng \u00b7 Pull Request #4038 \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm6-qc77-v2rh", "ref_desc": "Edge ServiceBus module: DoS by exhausting memory of node with http request containing large body \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
