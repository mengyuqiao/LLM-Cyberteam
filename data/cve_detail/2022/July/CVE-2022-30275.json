{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30275", "Description": "The Motorola MOSCAD Toolbox software through 2022-05-02 relies on a cleartext password. It utilizes an MDLC driver to communicate with MOSCAD/ACE RTUs for engineering purposes. Access to these communications is protected by a password stored in cleartext in the wmdlcdrv.ini driver configuration file. In addition, this password is used for access control to MOSCAD/STS projects protected with the Legacy Password feature. In this case, an insecure CRC of the password is present in the project file: this CRC is validated against the password in the driver configuration file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30275", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMotorolasolutions\u00bbMdlc\u00bbVersion:4.80.0024cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.80.0024:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMotorolasolutions\u00bbMdlc\u00bbVersion:4.82.004cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.82.004:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMotorolasolutions\u00bbMdlc\u00bbVersion:4.83.001cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.83.001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-01-06  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 4  2023-08-28  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-02  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-06-26  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-179-05", "ref_desc": "Motorola Solutions MDLC | CISAMitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wZNhEtZVtHUIlGZn3G-PPJf7VZI.html"}]}
