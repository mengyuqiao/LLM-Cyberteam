{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30274", "Description": "The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 uses ECB encryption unsafely. It can communicate with an XRT LAN-to-radio gateway by means of an embedded client. Credentials for accessing this gateway are stored after being encrypted with the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode using a hardcoded key. Similarly, the ACE1000 RTU can route MDLC traffic over Extended Command and Management Protocol (XCMP) and Network Layer (XNL) networks via the MDLC driver. Authentication to the XNL port is protected by TEA in ECB mode using a hardcoded key.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30274", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMotorola\u00bbAce1000 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:motorola:ace1000_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Motorola\u00bbAce1000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-01-06  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-179-06", "ref_desc": "Motorola Solutions ACE1000 | CISAMitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Oazv3kD1K4KSpcWxkKS3NpK-X3E.html"}]}
