{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31146", "Description": "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. There is a bug in the Wasmtime's code generator, Cranelift, where functions using reference types may be incorrectly missing metadata required for runtime garbage collection. This means that if a GC happens at runtime then the GC pass will mistakenly think these functions do not have live references to GC'd values, reclaiming them and deallocating them. The function will then subsequently continue to use the values assuming they had not been GC'd, leading later to a use-after-free. This bug was introduced in the migration to the `regalloc2` register allocator that occurred in the Wasmtime 0.37.0 release on 2022-05-20. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime version 0.38.2. Mitigations for this issue can be achieved by disabling the reference types proposal by passing `false` to `wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types` or downgrading to Wasmtime 0.36.0 or prior.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31146", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nBytecodealliance\u00bbCranelift-codegen\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.84.0andbefore (<) 0.85.2cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:cranelift-codegen:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.37.0andbefore (<) 0.38.2cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.23%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-05  0.28%  0.23%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-03-10  0.26%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-25  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-10  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-12-31  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-27  0.08%  0.22%  +0.14 \n 8  2023-06-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-05-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/", "ref_desc": "GitHub - bytecodealliance/wasmtime: A standalone runtime for WebAssemblyProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-5fhj-g3p3-pq9g", "ref_desc": "Use After Free with `externref`s in Wasmtime \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types", "ref_desc": "GitHub - WebAssembly/reference-types: Proposal for adding basic reference types (anyref)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
