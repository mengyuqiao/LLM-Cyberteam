{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31170", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31170", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.7.1cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-11  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-252 Unchecked Return Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/252/Unchecked-Return-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3552", "ref_desc": "Fix issues caused by abi.decode reverting by Amxx \u00b7 Pull Request #3552 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7MBumSA-tzGHSu6hOy-j0v0q_m4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-qh9x-gcfh-pcrw", "ref_desc": "ERC165Checker may revert instead of returning false \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
