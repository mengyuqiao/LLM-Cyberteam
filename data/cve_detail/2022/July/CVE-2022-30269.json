{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30269", "Description": "Motorola ACE1000 RTUs through 2022-05-02 mishandle application integrity. They allow for custom application installation via either STS software, the C toolkit, or the ACE1000 Easy Configurator. In the case of the Easy Configurator, application images (as PLX/DAT/APP/CRC files) are uploaded via the Web UI. In case of the C toolkit, they are transferred and installed using SFTP/SSH. In each case, application images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30269", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMotorola\u00bbAce1000 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:motorola:ace1000_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Motorola\u00bbAce1000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-06  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-02  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-179-06", "ref_desc": "Motorola Solutions ACE1000 | CISAMitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Oazv3kD1K4KSpcWxkKS3NpK-X3E.html"}]}
