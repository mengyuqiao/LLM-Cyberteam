{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35861", "Description": "pyenv 1.2.24 through 2.3.2 allows local users to gain privileges via a .python-version file in the current working directory. An attacker can craft a Python version string in .python-version to execute shims under their control. (Shims are executables that pass a command along to a specific version of pyenv. The version string is used to construct the path to the command, and there is no validation of whether the version specified is a valid version. Thus, relative path traversal can occur.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35861", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nPyenv\u00bbPyenvVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.24andup to, including, (<=) 2.3.2cpe:2.3:a:pyenv:pyenv:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/commit/22fa683571d98b59ea16e5fe48ac411c67939653", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-35861: Fixed relative path traversal due to using version st\u2026 \u00b7 pyenv/pyenv@22fa683 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
