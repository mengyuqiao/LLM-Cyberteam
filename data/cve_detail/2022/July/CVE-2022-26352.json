{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26352", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the ContentResource API in dotCMS 3.0 through 22.02. Attackers can craft a multipart form request to post a file whose filename is not initially sanitized. This allows directory traversal, in which the file is saved outside of the intended storage location. If anonymous content creation is enabled, this allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload an executable file, such as a .jsp file, that can lead to remote code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26352", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDotcms\u00bbDotcmsVersions  from including (>=) 3.0andup to, including, (<=) 22.02cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.49%  97.18%  -0.32 \n 2  2024-11-05  97.43%  97.49%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-09-23  97.42%  97.43%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-08-26  97.44%  97.42%  -0.02 \n 5  2024-07-30  97.46%  97.44%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-07-01  97.45%  97.46%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-06-15  97.46%  97.45%  -0.01 \n 8  2024-06-02  97.48%  97.46%  -0.02 \n 9  2024-05-19  97.53%  97.48%  -0.05 \n 10  2024-01-10  97.49%  97.53%  +0.04 \n 11  2023-12-28  97.48%  97.49%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-11-18  97.44%  97.48%  +0.04 \n 13  2023-11-05  97.47%  97.44%  -0.03 \n 14  2023-10-22  97.49%  97.47%  -0.02 \n 15  2023-09-26  97.51%  97.49%  -0.02 \n 16  2023-09-22  97.51%  97.51%  0.00 \n 17  2023-09-13  97.47%  97.51%  +0.05 \n 18  2023-08-19  97.52%  97.47%  -0.06 \n 19  2023-07-24  97.51%  97.52%  +0.01 \n 20  2023-07-13  97.45%  97.51%  +0.07 \n 21  2023-06-29  97.40%  97.45%  +0.05 \n 22  2023-06-17  97.36%  97.40%  +0.04 \n 23  2023-06-06  97.41%  97.36%  -0.06 \n 24  2023-05-24  97.44%  97.41%  -0.03 \n 25  2023-05-13  97.48%  97.44%  -0.04 \n 26  2023-05-01  97.49%  97.48%  -0.01 \n 27  2023-04-07  97.51%  97.49%  -0.02 \n 28  2023-03-29  97.53%  97.51%  -0.01 \n 29  2023-03-16  97.53%  97.53%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167365/dotCMS-Shell-Upload.html", "ref_desc": "dotCMS Shell Upload \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/dotcms", "ref_desc": "dotCMS User Group - Google GroupsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
