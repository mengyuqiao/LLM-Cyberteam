{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30276", "Description": "The Motorola MOSCAD and ACE line of RTUs through 2022-05-02 omit an authentication requirement. They feature IP Gateway modules which allow for interfacing between Motorola Data Link Communication (MDLC) networks (potentially over a variety of serial, RF and/or Ethernet links) and TCP/IP networks. Communication with RTUs behind the gateway is done by means of the proprietary IPGW protocol (5001/TCP). This protocol does not have any authentication features, allowing any attacker capable of communicating with the port in question to invoke (a subset of) desired functionality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30276", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMotorola\u00bbMoscad Ip Gateway Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:motorola:moscad_ip_gateway_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Motorola\u00bbMoscad Ip Gateway\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMotorola\u00bbAce Ip Gateway (4600) Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:motorola:ace_ip_gateway_\\(4600\\)_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Motorola\u00bbAce Ip Gateway (4600)\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-08-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "ref_desc": "Blog - ForescoutThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cmG_UlQKqGpkoMij6Q4rP_olUqc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-179-04", "ref_desc": "Motorola Solutions MOSCAD IP and ACE IP Gateways | CISAMitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
