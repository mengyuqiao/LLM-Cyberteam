{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-27580", "Description": "A deserialization vulnerability in a .NET framework class used and not properly checked by Safety Designer all versions up to and including 1.11.0 allows an attacker to craft malicious project files. Opening/importing such a malicious project file would execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user when opened or imported by the Safety Designer. This compromises confidentiality integrity and availability. For the attack to succeed a user must manually open a malicious project file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27580", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSick\u00bbSafety DesignerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.11.0cpe:2.3:a:sick:safety_designer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-09  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-08-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.06%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sick.com/psirt", "ref_desc": "The SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT) | SICKMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v6inTk1Bf2cm1HoZcfS_iK5G0TQ.html"}]}
