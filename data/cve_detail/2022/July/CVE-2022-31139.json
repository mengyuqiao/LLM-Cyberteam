{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31139", "Description": "UnsafeAccessor (UA) is a bridge to access jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe & sun.misc.Unsafe. Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard API. The main application can set up `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access to UA. Starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is set up, untrusted code can access UA without limitation, even when UA is loaded as a named module. This issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31139", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nUnsafe Accessor Project\u00bbUnsafe AccessorVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:unsafe_accessor_project:unsafe_accessor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-01  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-22  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-13  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-18  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-06-11  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor/releases/tag/1.7.0", "ref_desc": "Release 1.7.0 \u00b7 Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor/security/advisories/GHSA-cr6p-23cf-w9g9", "ref_desc": "NO Security checking for UnsafeAccess.getInstance() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor/commit/4ef83000184e8f13239a1ea2847ee401d81585fd", "ref_desc": "Fix UnsafeAccess perm checking \u00b7 Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor@4ef8300 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
