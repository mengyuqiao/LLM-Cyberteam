{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-33744", "Description": "Arm guests can cause Dom0 DoS via PV devices When mapping pages of guests on Arm, dom0 is using an rbtree to keep track of the foreign mappings. Updating of that rbtree is not always done completely with the related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which can be used by unprivileged guests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies of the rbtree. These inconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) of dom0, e.g. by causing crashes or the inability to perform further mappings of other guests' memory pages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33744", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 3.13andup to, including, (<=) 5.18cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/05/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 406 v3 (CVE-2022-33744) - Arm guests can cause Dom0 DoS via PV devicesMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00000.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3131-1] linux security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BIpcRCFTfkJAbRPTuNootWZmhKo.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-406.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-406 - Xen Security AdvisoriesPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5191", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5191-1 linuxThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HjDbpKnZw39J7753kDGubePK6M4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-406.txt", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
