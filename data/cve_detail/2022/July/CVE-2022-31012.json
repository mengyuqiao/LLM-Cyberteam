{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31012", "Description": "Git for Windows is a fork of Git that contains Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability in versions prior to 2.37.1 lets Git for Windows' installer execute a binary into `C:\\mingw64\\bin\\git.exe` by mistake. This only happens upon a fresh install, not when upgrading Git for Windows. A patch is included in version 2.37.1. Two workarounds are available. Create the `C:\\mingw64` folder and remove read/write access from this folder, or disallow arbitrary authenticated users to create folders in `C:\\`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31012", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nGitforwindows\u00bbGIT\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 2.37.1cpe:2.3:a:gitforwindows:git:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-02  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gjrj-fxvp-hjj2", "ref_desc": "Git for Windows' installer can be tricked into executing an untrusted binary \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.37.1.windows.1", "ref_desc": "Release Git for Windows 2.37.1 \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
