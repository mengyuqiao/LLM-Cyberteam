{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31172", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.1.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to the SignatureChecker reverting. `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` is not expected to revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-1271 as expected. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `SignatureChecker` to check the validity of a signature and handle invalid signatures in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31172", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.7.1cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-11  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3552", "ref_desc": "Fix issues caused by abi.decode reverting by Amxx \u00b7 Pull Request #3552 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7MBumSA-tzGHSu6hOy-j0v0q_m4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4g63-c64m-25w9", "ref_desc": "SignatureChecker may revert on invalid EIP-1271 signers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
