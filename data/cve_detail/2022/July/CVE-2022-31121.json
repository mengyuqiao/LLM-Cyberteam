{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31121", "Description": "Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned distributed ledger framework. In affected versions if a consensus client sends a malformed consensus request to an orderer it may crash the orderer node. A fix has been added in commit 0f1835949 which checks for missing consensus messages and returns an error to the consensus client should the message be missing. Users are advised to upgrade to versions 2.2.7 or v2.4.5. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31121", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nHyperledger\u00bbFabricVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.4.5cpe:2.3:a:hyperledger:fabric:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHyperledger\u00bbFabricVersions  before (<) 2.2.7cpe:2.3:a:hyperledger:fabric:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-02-26  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-12  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-12-18  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-09  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-07-14  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-06-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/0f18359493bcbd5f9f9d1a9b05adabfe5da23b06", "ref_desc": "Check if inner consensus message is missing \u00b7 hyperledger/fabric@0f18359 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v2.4.5", "ref_desc": "Release v2.4.5 \u00b7 hyperledger/fabric \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/security/advisories/GHSA-72x4-cq6r-jp4p", "ref_desc": "Improper Input Validation in orderer/common/cluster consensus request \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hyperledger/fabric \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v2.2.7", "ref_desc": "Release v2.2.7 \u00b7 hyperledger/fabric \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
