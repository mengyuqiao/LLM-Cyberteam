{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31140", "Description": "Valinor is a PHP library that helps to map any input into a strongly-typed value object structure. Prior to version 0.12.0, Valinor can use `Throwable#getMessage()` when it should not have permission to do so. This is a problem with cases such as an SQL exception showing an SQL snippet, a database connection exception showing database IP address/username/password, or a timeout detail / out of memory detail. Attackers could use this information for potential data exfiltration, denial of service attacks, enumeration attacks, etc. Version 0.12.0 contains a patch for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31140", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCuyz\u00bbValinorVersions  before (<) 0.12.0cpe:2.3:a:cuyz:valinor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-01  0.21%  0.20%  0.00 \n 3  2023-12-22  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-13  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-18  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-06-11  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/releases/tag/0.12.0", "ref_desc": "Release 0.12.0 \u00b7 CuyZ/Valinor \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/security/advisories/GHSA-5pgm-3j3g-2rc7", "ref_desc": "Error messages leading to potential data exfiltration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CuyZ/Valinor \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
