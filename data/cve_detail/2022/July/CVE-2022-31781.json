{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31781", "Description": "Apache Tapestry up to version 5.8.1 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles Content Types. Specially crafted Content Types may cause catastrophic backtracking, taking exponential time to complete. Specifically, this is about the regular expression used on the parameter of the org.apache.tapestry5.http.ContentType class. Apache Tapestry 5.8.2 has a fix for this vulnerability. Notice the vulnerability cannot be triggered by web requests in Tapestry code alone. It would only happen if there's some non-Tapestry codepath passing some outside input to the ContentType class constructor.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31781", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbTapestryVersions  before (<) 5.8.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:tapestry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-12  0.11%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.16%  0.11%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-05-29  0.31%  0.16%  -0.15 \n 4  2024-02-03  0.33%  0.31%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-08-15  0.46%  0.33%  -0.14 \n 6  2023-07-26  0.33%  0.46%  +0.14 \n 7  2023-07-20  0.07%  0.33%  +0.26 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/12/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2022-31781] Apache Tapestry denial of service vulnerabilityMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
