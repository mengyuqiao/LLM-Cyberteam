{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26305", "Description": "An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice existed where determining if a macro was signed by a trusted author was done by only matching the serial number and issuer string of the used certificate with that of a trusted certificate. This is not sufficient to verify that the macro was actually signed with the certificate. An adversary could therefore create an arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26305", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nLibreoffice\u00bbLibreofficeVersions  from including (>=) 7.2.0andbefore (<) 7.2.7cpe:2.3:a:libreoffice:libreoffice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLibreoffice\u00bbLibreofficeVersions  from including (>=) 7.3.0andbefore (<) 7.3.2cpe:2.3:a:libreoffice:libreoffice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-15  0.25%  0.23%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-01-05  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-08-27  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-08-01  0.12%  0.19%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-07-08  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-06-25  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-27  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.07%  -1.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/cve-2022-26305", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-26305 | LibreOffice - Free Office Suite - Based on OpenOffice - Compatible with MicrosoftVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/03/msg00022.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3368-1] libreoffice security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/D2yO0kGiwIVHnmh0tVrD5jjD2WM.html"}]}
