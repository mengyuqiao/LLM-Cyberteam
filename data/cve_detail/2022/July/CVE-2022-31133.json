{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31133", "Description": "HumHub is an Open Source Enterprise Social Network. Affected versions of HumHub are vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, the attacker would need a permission to administer the Spaces feature. The names of individual \"spaces\" are not properly escaped and so an attacker with sufficient privilege could insert malicious javascript into a space name and exploit system users who visit that space. It is recommended that the HumHub is upgraded to 1.11.4, 1.10.5. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31133", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nHumhub\u00bbHumhubVersions  before (<) 1.10.5cpe:2.3:a:humhub:humhub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHumhub\u00bbHumhubVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.4cpe:2.3:a:humhub:humhub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-01-28  0.10%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2023-07-14  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-07  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/humhub/humhub/commit/07d9f8f9b6334970ee38156a3416c3708d157cae", "ref_desc": "Fix format of displaying user profile title field on \"People\" page (#\u2026 \u00b7 humhub/humhub@07d9f8f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/89d996a2-de30-4261-8e3f-98e54cb25f76", "ref_desc": "Improper access control could make any user export all user of website vulnerability found in humhubNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/humhub/humhub/security/advisories/GHSA-p7h3-73v7-959c", "ref_desc": "XSS in Space Admin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 humhub/humhub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/humhub/humhub/commit/f88991dfe56a05870df165ac89a2755dd4c1ffa1", "ref_desc": "Fix space name in membership confirmation (#5790) \u00b7 humhub/humhub@f88991d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
