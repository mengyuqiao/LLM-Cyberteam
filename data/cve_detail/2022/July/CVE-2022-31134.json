{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31134", "Description": "Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip Server versions 2.1.0 above have a user interface tool, accessible only to server owners and server administrators, which provides a way to download a \"public data\" export. While this export is only accessible to administrators, in many configurations server administrators are not expected to have access to private messages and private streams. However, the \"public data\" export which administrators could generate contained the attachment contents for all attachments, even those from private messages and streams. Zulip Server version 5.4 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31134", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulip ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andbefore (<) 5.4cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-28  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-02-02  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-23  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 5  2023-07-19  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-06-12  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.zulip.com/2022/07/12/zulip-server-5-4-security-release", "ref_desc": "Zulip Server 5.4 security releaseRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.zulip.com/2022/07/12/zulip-cloud-data-exports", "ref_desc": "Data exported by Zulip Cloud organization administrators contained private filesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-58pm-88xp-7x9m", "ref_desc": "Public data export contains attachments that are non-public \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
