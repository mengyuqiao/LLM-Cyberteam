{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31080", "Description": "KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, a large response received by the viaduct WSClient can cause a DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of the response is being read into memory which could allow an attacker to send a request that returns a response with a large body. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the process which invokes a WSClient will be in a denial of service. The software is affected If users who are authenticated to the edge side connect to `cloudhub` from the edge side through WebSocket protocol. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31080", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  before (<) 1.9.4cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbKubeedgeVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.2cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:kubeedge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-02-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-18  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-6wvc-6pww-qr4r", "ref_desc": "Websocket Client in package Viaduct: DoS from large response message \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kubeedge/kubeedge \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
