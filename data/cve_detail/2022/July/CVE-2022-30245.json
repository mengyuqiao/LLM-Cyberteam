{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-30245", "Description": "Honeywell Alerton Compass Software 1.6.5 allows unauthenticated configuration changes from remote users. This enables configuration data to be stored on the controller and then implemented. A user with malicious intent can send a crafted packet to change the controller configuration without the knowledge of other users, altering the controller's function capabilities. The changed configuration is not updated in the User Interface, which creates an inconsistency between the configuration display and the actual configuration on the controller. After the configuration change, remediation requires reverting to the correct configuration, requiring either physical or remote access depending on the configuration that was altered.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30245", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHoneywell\u00bbAlerton Compass\u00bbVersion:1.6.5cpe:2.3:a:honeywell:alerton_compass:1.6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-05  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-12-26  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-22  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-15  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.08%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.scadafence.com", "ref_desc": "SCADAfence BlogThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Fzlsi1BNBMnuZRF8wp3YDLFTIqg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/scadafence/Honeywell-Alerton-Vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "GitHub - scadafence/Honeywell-Alerton-Vulnerabilities: Alerton Ascent Control Module (ACM) & Alerton Visual Logic vulnerabilitiesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/P5FJjGVbB8Lmm8hnkRpNNqU40Dw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/product-security", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TCUmUVgCxyb_UcZzlBChRCIGeB4.html"}]}
