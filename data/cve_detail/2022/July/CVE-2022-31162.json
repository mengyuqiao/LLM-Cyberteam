{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-31162", "Description": "Slack Morphism is an async client library for Rust. Prior to 0.41.0, it was possible for Slack OAuth client information to leak in application debug logs. Stricter and more secure debug formatting was introduced in v0.41.0 for OAuth secret types to reduce the possibility of printing sensitive information in application logs. As a workaround, do not print/output requests and responses for OAuth and client configurations in logs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31162", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSlack Morphism Project\u00bbSlack Morphism\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.41.0cpe:2.3:a:slack_morphism_project:slack_morphism:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-11  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-01  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-23  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-28  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-21  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/212/Improper-Removal-of-Sensitive-Information-Before-Storage-or-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1258 Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1258/Exposure-of-Sensitive-System-Information-Due-to-Uncleared-De.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/abdolence/slack-morphism-rust/releases/tag/v0.41.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.41.0 \u00b7 abdolence/slack-morphism-rust \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/abdolence/slack-morphism-rust/security/advisories/GHSA-99j7-mhfh-w84p", "ref_desc": "Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information in slack-morphism \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 abdolence/slack-morphism-rust \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
