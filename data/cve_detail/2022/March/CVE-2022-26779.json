{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26779", "Description": "Apache CloudStack prior to 4.16.1.0 used insecure random number generation for project invitation tokens. If a project invite is created based only on an email address, a random token is generated. An attacker with knowledge of the project ID and the fact that the invite is sent, could generate time deterministic tokens and brute force attempt to use them prior to the legitimate receiver accepting the invite. This feature is not enabled by default, the attacker is required to know or guess the project ID for the invite in addition to the invitation token, and the attacker would need to be an existing authorized user of CloudStack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26779", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCloudstackVersions  before (<) 4.16.1.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:cloudstack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.37%  0.23%  -0.13 \n 2  2023-11-05  0.29%  0.37%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-10-21  0.24%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-10-06  0.28%  0.24%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-08-26  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-22  0.16%  0.27%  +0.11 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/dmm07b1cyosovqr12ddhkko501p11h2h", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-26779: Apache Cloudstack insecure random number generation affects project email invitation-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/03/15/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2022-26779: Apache Cloudstack insecure random number generation affects project email invitationMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-vpcc-9rh2-8jfp", "ref_desc": "apache/cloudstack: Privileged escalation due to Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) and Use of Insufficiently Random Values \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 JLLeitschuh/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
