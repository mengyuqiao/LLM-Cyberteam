{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24797", "Description": "Pomerium is an identity-aware access proxy. In distributed service mode, Pomerium's Authenticate service exposes pprof debug and prometheus metrics handlers to untrusted traffic. This can leak potentially sensitive environmental information or lead to limited denial of service conditions. This issue is patched in version v0.17.1 Workarounds: Block access to `/debug` and `/metrics` paths on the authenticate service. This can be done with any L7 proxy, including Pomerium's own proxy service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24797", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nPomerium\u00bbPomeriumVersions  from including (>=) 0.16.0andbefore (<) 0.17.1cpe:2.3:a:pomerium:pomerium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-14  0.23%  0.26%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-04  0.20%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-10-09  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-11-20  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-06  0.14%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-10-22  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-09-11  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-05-03  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-04-07  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/3212", "ref_desc": "authenticate: fix debug and metrics endpoints by calebdoxsey \u00b7 Pull Request #3212 \u00b7 pomerium/pomerium \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/commit/b435f73e2b54088da2aca5e8c3aa1808293d6903", "ref_desc": "authenticate: fix debug and metrics endpoints (#3212) \u00b7 pomerium/pomerium@b435f73 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/security/advisories/GHSA-q98f-2x4p-prjr", "ref_desc": "Exposure of debug and metrics endpoints in Pomerium \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pomerium/pomerium \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
