{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24742", "Description": "Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, any other user can view the data if browser tab remains unclosed after log out. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. A workaround is available. The application must strictly redirect to login page even browser back button is pressed. Another possibility is to set more strict cache policies for restricted content.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24742", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.11cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.2cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  before (<) 1.9.10cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-18  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.11.2", "ref_desc": "Release v1.11.2 \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1pI-MYdVomKt6GM580H-YtLZg9M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.9.10", "ref_desc": "Release v1.9.10 \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6GDn2yjqlyFp9dnptkwSiKl1FkI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.10.11", "ref_desc": "Release v1.10.11 \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DE92ifBeWBw9MyzC2qkZ1kUMVAk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/security/advisories/GHSA-7563-75j9-6h5p", "ref_desc": "Exposure of sensitive information by using the back button after logging out in sylius/sylius \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
