{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-26317", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.29). When returning the result of a completed Microflow execution call the affected framework does not correctly verify, if the request was initially made by the user requesting the result. Together with predictable identifiers for Microflow execution calls, this could allow a malicious attacker to retrieve information about arbitrary Microflow execution calls made by users within the affected system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26317", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMendix\u00bbMendixVersions  before (<) 7.23.29cpe:2.3:a:mendix:mendix:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2023-09-29  0.07%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-08-19  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.06%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-415938.pdf", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
