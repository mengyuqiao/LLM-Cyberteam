{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24743", "Description": "Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.10.11 and 1.11.2, the reset password token was not set to null after the password was changed. The same token could be used several times, which could result in leak of the existing token and unauthorized password change. The issue is fixed in versions 1.10.11 and 1.11.2. As a workaround, overwrite the `Sylius\\Bundle\\ApiBundle\\CommandHandler\\ResetPasswordHandler` class with code provided by the maintainers and register it in a container. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24743", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.11cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.2cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-11-27  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-18  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-05  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-05  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-08-25  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.11.2", "ref_desc": "Release v1.11.2 \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1pI-MYdVomKt6GM580H-YtLZg9M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.10.11", "ref_desc": "Release v1.10.11 \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DE92ifBeWBw9MyzC2qkZ1kUMVAk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/security/advisories/GHSA-mf3v-f2qq-pf9g", "ref_desc": "Reset password token not set to null after reset password \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
