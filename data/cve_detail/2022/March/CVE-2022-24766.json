{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24766", "Description": "mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24766", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMitmproxy\u00bbMitmproxyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.0.4cpe:2.3:a:mitmproxy:mitmproxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-04  0.19%  0.18%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-10-25  0.19%  0.19%  0.00 \n 3  2023-11-10  0.16%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-10-27  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-12  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-09-01  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-28  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commit/b06fb6d157087d526bd02e7aadbe37c56865c71b", "ref_desc": "security: reject whitespace in HTTP/1 header names \u00b7 mitmproxy/mitmproxy@b06fb6d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mitmproxy.org/posts/releases/mitmproxy8/", "ref_desc": "Mitmproxy 8Release Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/security/advisories/GHSA-gcx2-gvj7-pxv3", "ref_desc": "Insufficient Protection against HTTP Request Smuggling in mitmproxy \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mitmproxy/mitmproxy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
