{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24737", "Description": "HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. HTTPie has the practical concept of sessions, which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. Before 3.1.0, HTTPie didn\u2018t distinguish between cookies and hosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third party website. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24737", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHttpie\u00bbHttpieVersions  before (<) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:httpie:httpie:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.23%  0.00 \n 2  2024-11-20  0.23%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-11  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-29  0.17%  0.22%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.24%  0.17%  -0.07 \n 6  2023-08-18  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-06-12  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-04-09  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-03-14  0.08%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.08%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/httpie/httpie/security/advisories/GHSA-9w4w-cpc8-h2fq", "ref_desc": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in httpie \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 httpie/httpie \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TXFCHGTW3V32GD6GXXJZE5QAOSDT3RTY/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: httpie-3.1.0-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4QZD2AZOL7XLNZVAV6GDNXYU6MFRU5RS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: httpie-3.1.0-1.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/httpie/httpie/commit/65ab7d5caaaf2f95e61f9dd65441801c2ddee38b", "ref_desc": "Implement new style cookies \u00b7 httpie/httpie@65ab7d5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MDFIMtdEAtaoE2Mzx_50cFX05ms.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/httpie/httpie/releases/tag/3.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release HTTPie 3.1.0 \u00b7 httpie/httpie \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/R5VYSYKEKVZEVEBIWAADGDXG4Y3EWCQ3/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: httpie-3.1.0-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
