{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24777", "Description": "grpc-swift is the Swift language implementation of gRPC, a remote procedure call (RPC) framework. Prior to version 1.7.2, a grpc-swift server is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via a reachable assertion. This is due to incorrect logic when handling GOAWAY frames. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to construct and send the required sequence of frames. The impact on availability is high as the server will crash, dropping all in flight connections and requests. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.2. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24777", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbGrpc SwiftVersions  before (<) 1.7.2cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:grpc_swift:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-29  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-16  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 4  2023-09-05  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift/security/advisories/GHSA-r6ww-5963-7r95", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service via reachable assertion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grpc/grpc-swift \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift/commit/858f977f2a51fca2292f384cf7a108dc2e73a3bd", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-r6ww-5963-7r95 \u00b7 grpc/grpc-swift@858f977 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
