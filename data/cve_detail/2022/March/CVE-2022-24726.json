{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24726", "Description": "Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In affected versions the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing when the validating webhook for a cluster is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [external istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.2, 1.12.5 and 1.11.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable access to a validating webhook that is exposed to the public internet or restrict the set of IP addresses that can query it to a set of known, trusted entities.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24726", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.2cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.5cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIstio\u00bbIstioVersions  before (<) 1.11.8cpe:2.3:a:istio:istio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.16%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-23  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-14  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-09-18  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-30  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-10-16  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-10-01  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-08-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-04-12  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-17  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51112", "ref_desc": "regexp: stack overflow (process exit) handling deeply nested regexp \u00b7 Issue #51112 \u00b7 golang/go \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/istio/security/advisories/GHSA-8w5h-qr4r-2h6g", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated control plane denial of service attack due to stack exhaustion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 istio/istio \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/istio/istio/commit/6ca5055a4db6695ef5504eabdfde3799f2ea91fd", "ref_desc": "[release-1.13] pilot: limit reads from untrusted inputs (#37792) \u00b7 istio/istio@6ca5055 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
