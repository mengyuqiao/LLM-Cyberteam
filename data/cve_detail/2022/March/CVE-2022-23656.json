{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23656", "Description": "Zulip is an open source team chat app. The `main` development branch of Zulip Server from June 2021 and later is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability on the recent topics page. An attacker could maliciously craft a full name for their account and send messages to a topic with several participants; a victim who then opens an overflow tooltip including this full name on the recent topics page could trigger execution of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker. Users running a Zulip server from the main branch should upgrade from main (2022-03-01 or later) again to deploy this fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23656", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulip ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2021-06-03andbefore (<) 2022-03-01cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-23  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.05%  -1.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-fc77-h3jc-6mfv", "ref_desc": "Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Zulip Server development branch via tooltip \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/e090027adcbf62737d5b1f83a9618a9500a49321", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-23656: Fix cross-site scripting vulnerability in tooltips. \u00b7 zulip/zulip@e090027 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
