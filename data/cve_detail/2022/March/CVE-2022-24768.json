{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24768", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24768", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.8cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.2cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 0.5.0andbefore (<) 2.1.14cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.11%  -0.08 \n 2  2024-11-23  0.13%  0.19%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-11-12  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-29  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-15  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-06-28  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-30  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.1.14", "ref_desc": "Release v2.1.14 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.2.8", "ref_desc": "Release v2.2.8 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/af03b291d4b7e9d3ce9a6580ae9c8141af0e05cf", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2f5v-8r3f-8pww \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd@af03b29 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.3.2", "ref_desc": "Release v2.3.2 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-2f5v-8r3f-8pww", "ref_desc": "Improper access control allows admin privilege escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wur0dDBxTWOwlsggZNJDfblJ9z0.html"}]}
