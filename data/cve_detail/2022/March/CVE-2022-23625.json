{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23625", "Description": "Wire-ios is a messaging application using the wire protocol on apple's ios platform. In versions prior to 3.95 malformed resource identifiers may render the iOS Wire Client completely unusable by causing it to repeatedly crash on launch. These malformed resource identifiers can be generated and sent between Wire users. The root cause lies in [wireapp/wire-ios-transport](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-transport), where code responsible for removing sensible tokens before logging may fail and lead to a crash (Swift exception) of the application. This causes undesirable behavior, however the (greater) Wire system is still functional. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23625", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWire\u00bbWire\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 3.95cpe:2.3:a:wire:wire:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions\nWire\u00bbWire-ios-transport\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 84.1.1cpe:2.3:a:wire:wire-ios-transport:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-31  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-02  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-18  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-transport/commit/02e90aa45edaf7eb2d8b97fa2377cd8104274170", "ref_desc": "fix: remove sensitive info SQCORE-1246 (#241) \u00b7 wireapp/wire-ios-transport@02e90aa \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/security/advisories/GHSA-rq36-8qfp-79mc", "ref_desc": "DoS vulnerability: Malformed Resource Identifiers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wireapp/wire-ios \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-transport/security/advisories/GHSA-3xvh-x964-572h", "ref_desc": "DoS vulnerability: Malformed Resource Identifiers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wireapp/wire-ios-transport \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
