{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24762", "Description": "sysend.js is a library that allows a user to send messages between pages that are open in the same browser. Users that use cross-origin communication may have their communications intercepted. Impact is limited by the communication occurring in the same browser. This issue has been patched in sysend.js version 1.10.0. The only currently known workaround is to avoid sending communications that a user does not want to have intercepted via sysend messages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24762", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSysend.js Project\u00bbSysend.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.10.0cpe:2.3:a:sysend.js_project:sysend.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-27  0.14%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-10-18  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-06-05  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-10-05  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 6  2023-08-25  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-16  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-21  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jcubic/sysend.js/commit/a24f4b776fb18191ae0f7e3d90c2c7bec459431a", "ref_desc": "fix security issue with Cross-Domain communication #33 \u00b7 jcubic/sysend.js@a24f4b7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jcubic/sysend.js/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvg-x86p-mvqc", "ref_desc": "Leaking of user information on Cross-Domain communication \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jcubic/sysend.js \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jcubic/sysend.js/releases/tag/1.10.0", "ref_desc": "Release 1.10.0 \u00b7 jcubic/sysend.js \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jcubic/sysend.js/issues/33", "ref_desc": "Leaking of potentially sensitive user information on Cross-Domain communication \u00b7 Issue #33 \u00b7 jcubic/sysend.js \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
