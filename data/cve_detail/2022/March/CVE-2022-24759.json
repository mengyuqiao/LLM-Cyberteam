{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24759", "Description": "`@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24759", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nChainsafe\u00bbJs-libp2p-noise\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.3cpe:2.3:a:chainsafe:js-libp2p-noise:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nChainsafe\u00bbJs-libp2p-noise\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.1.2cpe:2.3:a:chainsafe:js-libp2p-noise:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2023-11-06  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-23  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-08  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-24  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise/releases/tag/v5.0.3", "ref_desc": "Release Release v5.0.3 \u00b7 ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise/pull/130", "ref_desc": "chore: Fix signature validation bug by mpetrunic \u00b7 Pull Request #130 \u00b7 ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise/security/advisories/GHSA-j3ff-xp6c-6gcc", "ref_desc": "Failure to validate signature during handshake \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
