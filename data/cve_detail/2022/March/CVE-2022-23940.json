{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23940", "Description": "SuiteCRM through 7.12.1 and 8.x through 8.0.1 allows Remote Code Execution. Authenticated users with access to the Scheduled Reports module can achieve this by leveraging PHP deserialization in the email_recipients property. By using a crafted request, they can create a malicious report, containing a PHP-deserialization payload in the email_recipients field. Once someone accesses this report, the backend will deserialize the content of the email_recipients field and the payload gets executed. Project dependencies include a number of interesting PHP deserialization gadgets (e.g., Monolog/RCE1 from phpggc) that can be used for Code Execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23940", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSalesagility\u00bbSuitecrmVersions  before (<) 7.12.5cpe:2.3:a:salesagility:suitecrm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSalesagility\u00bbSuitecrmVersions  from including (>=) 8.0andbefore (<) 8.0.4cpe:2.3:a:salesagility:suitecrm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.29%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-08-19  0.33%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-29  0.29%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-02-20  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-13  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-09-28  0.35%  0.27%  -0.08 \n 7  2023-04-09  0.55%  0.35%  -0.19 \n 8  2023-03-14  0.71%  0.55%  -0.16 \n 9  2023-03-07  23.85%  0.71%  -23.15 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.suitecrm.com/8.x/admin/releases/8.0/", "ref_desc": "8.0 Releases :: SuiteCRM DocumentationRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LPeGVhkI0vFmKk4TrthbBcA4dII.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/manuelz120", "ref_desc": "manuelz120 (Manuel Zametter) \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
