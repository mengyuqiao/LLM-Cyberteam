{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24789", "Description": "C1 CMS is an open-source, .NET based Content Management System (CMS). Versions prior to 6.12 allow an authenticated user to exploit Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by causing the server to make arbitrary GET requests to other servers in the local network or on localhost. The attacker may also truncate arbitrary files to zero size (effectively delete them) leading to denial of service (DoS) or altering application logic. The authenticated user may unknowingly perform the actions by visiting a specially crafted site. Patched in C1 CMS v6.12, no known workarounds exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24789", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOrckestra\u00bbC1 CmsVersions  before (<) 6.12cpe:2.3:a:orckestra:c1_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-19  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-04-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Orckestra/C1-CMS-Foundation/security/advisories/GHSA-j9c2-gr6m-pp45", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2022-001: Deserialization of untrusted data allows for Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or arbitrary file truncation. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Orckestra/C1-CMS-Foundation \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Orckestra/C1-CMS-Foundation/releases/tag/v6.12", "ref_desc": "Release C1 CMS 6.12 \u00b7 Orckestra/C1-CMS-Foundation \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
