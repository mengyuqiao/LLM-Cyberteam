{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24784", "Description": "Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. Before versions 3.2.39 and 3.3.2, it is possible to confirm a single character of a user's password hash using a specially crafted regular expression filter in the users endpoint of the REST API. Multiple such requests can eventually uncover the entire hash. The hash is not present in the response, however the presence or absence of a result confirms if the character is in the right position. The API has throttling enabled by default, making this a time intensive task. Both the REST API and the users endpoint need to be enabled, as they are disabled by default. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.2.39 and above, and 3.3.2 and above.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24784", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nStatamic\u00bbStatamicVersions  from including (>=) 3.3.0andbefore (<) 3.3.2cpe:2.3:a:statamic:statamic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nStatamic\u00bbStatamicVersions  before (<) 3.2.39cpe:2.3:a:statamic:statamic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-08  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-29  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-03  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-16  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-27  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-01  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/issues/5604", "ref_desc": "Prevent filtering users by password hashes in the APIs by jasonvarga \u00b7 Pull Request #5604 \u00b7 statamic/cms \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-qcgx-7p5f-hxvr", "ref_desc": "Discoverability of user password hash via REST API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 statamic/cms \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/pull/5568", "ref_desc": "Prevent filtering users by password hashes in the APIs by jasonvarga \u00b7 Pull Request #5568 \u00b7 statamic/cms \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
