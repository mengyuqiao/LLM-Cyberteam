{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24794", "Description": "Express OpenID Connect is an Express JS middleware implementing sign on for Express web apps using OpenID Connect. Users of the `requiresAuth` middleware, either directly or through the default `authRequired` option, are vulnerable to an Open Redirect when the middleware is applied to a catch all route. If all routes under `example.com` are protected with the `requiresAuth` middleware, a visit to `http://example.com//google.com` will be redirected to `google.com` after login because the original url reported by the Express framework is not properly sanitized. This vulnerability affects versions prior to 2.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24794", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nAuth0\u00bbExpress Openid Connect\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.7.2cpe:2.3:a:auth0:express_openid_connect:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-11-04  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-22  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/express-openid-connect/commit/0947b92164a2c5f661ebcc183d37e7f21de719ad", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7p99-3798-f85c \u00b7 auth0/express-openid-connect@0947b92 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/express-openid-connect/security/advisories/GHSA-7p99-3798-f85c", "ref_desc": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in express-openid-connect \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 auth0/express-openid-connect \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
