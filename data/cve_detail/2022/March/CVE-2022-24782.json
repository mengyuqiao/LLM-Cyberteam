{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24782", "Description": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions 2.8.2 and prior in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `tests-passed` branch are vulnerable to a data leak. Users can request an export of their own activity. Sometimes, due to category settings, they may have category membership for a secure category. The name of this secure category is shown to the user in the export. The same thing occurs when the user's post has been moved to a secure category. A patch for this issue is available in the `main` branch of Discourse's GitHub repository and is anticipated to be part of future releases.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24782", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.8.2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-31  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/9d5737fd28374cc876c070f6c3a931a8071ec356", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Hide private categories in user activity export (#16273) \u00b7 discourse/discourse@9d5737f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16273", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Hide private categories in user activity export by martin-brennan \u00b7 Pull Request #16273 \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-c3cq-w899-f343", "ref_desc": "Secure category names leaked via user activity export \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
