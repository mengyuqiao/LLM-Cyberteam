{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24772", "Description": "Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code does not check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a `DigestInfo` ASN.1 structure. This can allow padding bytes to be removed and garbage data added to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being used. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24772", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDigitalbazaar\u00bbForge\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:digitalbazaar:forge:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-26  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-09  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-08-29  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-20  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-25  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/3f0b49a0573ef1bb7af7f5673c0cfebf00424df1", "ref_desc": "Fix signature verification issues. \u00b7 digitalbazaar/forge@3f0b49a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NeHsCOwQ0aMDu6OQO6fTo0PqMGo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/bb822c02df0b61211836472e29b9790cc541cdb2", "ref_desc": "Add advisory links. \u00b7 digitalbazaar/forge@bb822c0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RMmN9l36k8Xia_cJ4KF_7jcQBf0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-x4jg-mjrx-434g", "ref_desc": "RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification failing to check tailing garbage bytes can lead to signature forgery. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 digitalbazaar/forge \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
