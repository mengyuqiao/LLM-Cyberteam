{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24798", "Description": "Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24798", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nInternet Routing Registry Daemon Project\u00bbInternet Routing Registry DaemonVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andbefore (<) 4.2.3cpe:2.3:a:internet_routing_registry_daemon_project:internet_routing_registry_daemon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-14  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-04  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-09  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-22  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-11  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-03  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-07  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/212/Improper-Removal-of-Sensitive-Information-Before-Storage-or-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/irrdnet/irrd/commit/fdffaf8dd71713f06e99dff417e6aa1e6fa84b70", "ref_desc": "[4.2.x] Correct missing password hash removal \u00b7 irrdnet/irrd@fdffaf8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/irrdnet/irrd/commit/0e41bae8d3d27316381a2fc7b466597230e35ec6", "ref_desc": "Correct missing password hash removal \u00b7 irrdnet/irrd@0e41bae \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/irrdnet/irrd/security/advisories/GHSA-cqxx-66wh-8pjw", "ref_desc": "Insufficient password hash filtering in some IRRd queries and exports \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 irrdnet/irrd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
