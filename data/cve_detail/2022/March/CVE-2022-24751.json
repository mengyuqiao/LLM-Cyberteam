{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24751", "Description": "Zulip is an open source group chat application. Starting with version 4.0 and prior to version 4.11, Zulip is vulnerable to a race condition during account deactivation, where a simultaneous access by the user being deactivated may, in rare cases, allow continued access by the deactivated user. A patch is available in version 4.11 on the 4.x branch and version 5.0-rc1 on the 5.x branch. Upgrading to a fixed version will, as a side effect, deactivate any cached sessions that may have been leaked through this bug. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24751", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulipVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andbefore (<) 4.11cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-24  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-07  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-08-27  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-23  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-6v98-m5x5-phqj", "ref_desc": "Race condition in user deactivation allows continued API access \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/62ba8e455d8f460001d9fb486a6dabfd1ed67717", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-24751: Clear sessions outside of the transaction. \u00b7 zulip/zulip@62ba8e4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/e6eace307ef435eec3395c99247155efed9219e4", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-24751: Clear sessions outside of the transaction. \u00b7 zulip/zulip@e6eace3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
