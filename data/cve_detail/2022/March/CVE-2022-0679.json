{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-0679", "Description": "The Narnoo Distributor WordPress plugin through 2.5.1 fails to validate and sanitize the lib_path parameter before it is passed into a call to require() via the narnoo_distributor_lib_request AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users) which results in the disclosure of arbitrary files as the content of the file is then displayed in the response as JSON data. This could also lead to RCE with various tricks but depends on the underlying system and it's configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0679", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nNarnoo Distributor Project\u00bbNarnoo Distributor\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.1cpe:2.3:a:narnoo_distributor_project:narnoo_distributor:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.29%  7.57%  +4.28 \n 2  2024-12-11  2.66%  3.29%  +0.63 \n 3  2024-11-01  2.21%  2.66%  +0.45 \n 4  2024-09-23  3.10%  2.21%  -0.89 \n 5  2023-12-01  2.82%  3.10%  +0.28 \n 6  2023-11-17  2.38%  2.82%  +0.45 \n 7  2023-10-19  3.33%  2.38%  -0.95 \n 8  2023-10-06  2.73%  3.33%  +0.60 \n 9  2023-09-21  2.51%  2.73%  +0.23 \n 10  2023-09-08  2.48%  2.51%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-08-26  1.98%  2.48%  +0.50 \n 12  2023-07-16  1.41%  1.98%  +0.58 \n 13  2023-06-20  0.81%  1.41%  +0.60 \n 14  2023-04-30  0.66%  0.81%  +0.15 \n 15  2023-04-04  0.53%  0.66%  +0.13 \n 16  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.53%  -0.36 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/0ea79eb1-6561-4c21-a20b-a1870863b0a8", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
