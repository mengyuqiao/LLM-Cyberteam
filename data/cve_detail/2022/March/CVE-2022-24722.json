{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24722", "Description": "VIewComponent is a framework for building view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24722", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbViewcomponent\u00bbForRuby On RailsVersions  from including (>=) 2.31.0andbefore (<) 2.31.2cpe:2.3:a:github:viewcomponent:*:*:*:*:*:ruby_on_rails:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbViewcomponent\u00bbForRuby On RailsVersions  from including (>=) 2.32.0andbefore (<) 2.49.1cpe:2.3:a:github:viewcomponent:*:*:*:*:*:ruby_on_rails:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.11%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-11-15  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-06  0.12%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-09-10  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-23  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-08-13  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-04  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-09  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-cm9w-c4rj-r2cf", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in view_component \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 github/view_component \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/view_component/releases/tag/v2.49.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.49.1 \u00b7 github/view_component \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/view_component/commit/3f82a6e62578ff6f361aba24a1feb2caccf83ff9", "ref_desc": "Fix XSS vulnerability when using HTML-safe translations and interpola\u2026 \u00b7 github/view_component@3f82a6e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/view_component/releases/tag/v2.31.2", "ref_desc": "Release v2.31.2 \u00b7 github/view_component \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
