{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24739", "Description": "alltube is an html front end for youtube-dl. On releases prior to 3.0.3, an attacker could craft a special HTML page to trigger either an open redirect attack or a Server-Side Request Forgery attack (depending on how AllTube is configured). The impact is mitigated by the fact the SSRF attack is only possible when the `stream` option is enabled in the configuration. (This option is disabled by default.) 3.0.3 contains a fix for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24739", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nAlltube Project\u00bbAlltubeVersions  before (<) 3.0.3cpe:2.3:a:alltube_project:alltube:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-12  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-29  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 5  2023-08-19  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-10  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/commit/bc14b6e45c766c05757fb607ef8d444cbbfba71a", "ref_desc": "Don't redirect to REQUEST_URI when browsing to index.php \u00b7 Rudloff/alltube@bc14b6e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/security/advisories/GHSA-75p7-527p-w8wp", "ref_desc": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Rudloff/alltube \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/commit/3a4f09dda0a466662a4e52cde674749e0c668e8d", "ref_desc": "Prevent SSRF requests \u00b7 Rudloff/alltube@3a4f09d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/commit/8913f27716400dabf4906a5ad690a5238f73496a", "ref_desc": "Disable the generic extractor entirely \u00b7 Rudloff/alltube@8913f27 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
