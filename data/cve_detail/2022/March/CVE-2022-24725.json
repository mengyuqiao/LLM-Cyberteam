{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24725", "Description": "Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An issue in versions 1.4.0 to 1.5.1 allows for exposure of the home directory on Unix systems when using Bash with the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions from the _shescape_ API with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Other tested shells, Dash and Zsh, are not affected. Depending on how the output of _shescape_ is used, directory traversal may be possible in the application using _shescape_. The issue was patched in version 1.5.1. As a workaround, manually escape all instances of the tilde character (`~`) using `arg.replace(/~/g, \"\\\\~\")`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24725", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nShescape Project\u00bbShescape\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.5.1cpe:2.3:a:shescape_project:shescape:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-03  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-29  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 4  2024-05-25  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-04-12  0.11%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-01-04  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-11-06  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-10-09  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-09-24  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-06-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/issues/169", "ref_desc": "String like `=~` in Bash not escaped properly by escape(All) with interpolation escaping enabled \u00b7 Issue #169 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/170", "ref_desc": "Escape trailing strings like `=~` for Bash-like shells by ericcornelissen \u00b7 Pull Request #170 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-446w-rrm4-r47f", "ref_desc": "Exposure of home directory through shescape on Unix with Bash \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
