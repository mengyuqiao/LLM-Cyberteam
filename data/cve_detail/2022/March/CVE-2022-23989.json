{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23989", "Description": "In Stormshield Network Security (SNS) before 3.7.25, 3.8.x through 3.11.x before 3.11.13, 4.x before 4.2.10, and 4.3.x before 4.3.5, a flood of connections to the SSLVPN service might lead to saturation of the loopback interface. This could result in the blocking of almost all network traffic, making the firewall unreachable. An attacker could exploit this via forged and properly timed traffic to cause a denial of service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23989", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nStormshield\u00bbStormshield Network SecurityVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.7.25cpe:2.3:a:stormshield:stormshield_network_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nStormshield\u00bbStormshield Network SecurityVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.10cpe:2.3:a:stormshield:stormshield_network_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nStormshield\u00bbStormshield Network SecurityVersions  from including (>=) 4.3.0andbefore (<) 4.3.5cpe:2.3:a:stormshield:stormshield_network_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nStormshield\u00bbStormshield Network SecurityVersions  from including (>=) 3.8.0andbefore (<) 3.11.13cpe:2.3:a:stormshield:stormshield_network_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-19  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-06  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-26  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-22  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://advisories.stormshield.eu/2022-003", "ref_desc": "SNS: Numerous connections to OpenVPN service lead to loopback saturation (CVE-2022-23989) | Stormshield securityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
