Before version 1.19.9, whitespace characters are not removed from the beginning of the protocol, so URLs are not parsed properly. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.9. Removing leading whitespace from values before passing them to URI.parse can be used as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24723", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nUri.js Project\u00bbUri.jsVersions  before (<) 1.19.9cpe:2.3:a:uri.js_project:uri.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-11-16  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-07  0.12%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-25  0.10%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-24  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-14  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-08  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-03-10  0.06%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/medialize/uri.js/commit/86d10523a6f6e8dc4300d99d671335ee362ad316", "ref_desc": "fix(parse): remove leading whitespace \u00b7 medialize/URI.js@86d1052 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/security/advisories/GHSA-gmv4-r438-p67f", "ref_desc": "Leading white space bypasses protocol validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 medialize/URI.js \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/82ef23b8-7025-49c9-b5fc-1bb9885788e5/", "ref_desc": "Protocol/Hostname spoofing via Improper Input Validation vulnerability found in uri.jsExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/releases/tag/v1.19.9", "ref_desc": "Release 1.19.9 (March 3rd 2022) \u00b7 medialize/URI.js \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
