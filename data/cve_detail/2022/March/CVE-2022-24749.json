{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24749", "Description": "Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. In versions prior to 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible to upload an SVG file containing cross-site scripting (XSS) code in the admin panel. In order to perform a XSS attack, the file itself has to be open in a new card or loaded outside of the IMG tag. The problem applies both to the files opened on the admin panel and shop pages. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. As a workaround, require a library that adds on-upload file sanitization and overwrite the service before writing the file to the filesystem. The GitHub Security Advisory contains more specific information about the workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24749", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.11cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.2cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  before (<) 1.9.10cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-27  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-18  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-25  0.10%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-04-16  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-21  0.14%  0.11%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.14%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.11.2", "ref_desc": "Release v1.11.2 \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1pI-MYdVomKt6GM580H-YtLZg9M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.9.10", "ref_desc": "Release v1.9.10 \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6GDn2yjqlyFp9dnptkwSiKl1FkI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.10.11", "ref_desc": "Release v1.10.11 \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DE92ifBeWBw9MyzC2qkZ1kUMVAk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/security/advisories/GHSA-4qrp-27r3-66fj", "ref_desc": "Improper sanitize of SVG files during content upload ('Cross-site Scripting') in Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
