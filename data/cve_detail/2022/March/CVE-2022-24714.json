{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24714", "Description": "Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24714", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIcinga\u00bbIcinga Web 2Versions  before (<) 2.8.6cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga_web_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcinga Web 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.6cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga_web_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-12  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-08-19  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-10  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-15  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/commit/6e989d05a1568a6733a3d912001251acc51d9293", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qcmg-vr56-x9wf \u00b7 Icinga/icingaweb2@6e989d0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/security/advisories/GHSA-qcmg-vr56-x9wf", "ref_desc": "Unwanted disclosure of hosts and related data, linked to decommissioned services \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Icinga/icingaweb2 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-05", "ref_desc": "Icinga Web 2: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-05) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q9T62EGIZ_ueKmXqMUaYj0O6G6s.html"}]}
