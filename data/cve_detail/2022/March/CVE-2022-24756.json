{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24756", "Description": "Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 but prior to 21.1.0, 20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is built and configured for PAM authentication, a failed PAM authentication will leak a small amount of memory. An attacker that is able to use the PAM Console (i.e. by knowing the shared secret or via the WebUI) can flood the Director with failing login attempts which will eventually lead to an out-of-memory condition in which the Director will not work anymore. Bareos Director versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 contain a Bugfix for this problem. Users who are unable to upgrade may disable PAM authentication as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24756", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBareos\u00bbBareosVersions  from including (>=) 18.2andbefore (<) 19.2.12cpe:2.3:a:bareos:bareos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBareos\u00bbBareosVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.0andbefore (<) 20.0.6cpe:2.3:a:bareos:bareos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBareos\u00bbBareosVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.0andbefore (<) 21.1.0cpe:2.3:a:bareos:bareos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.46%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-11-28  0.32%  0.36%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-10-19  0.27%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-06-06  0.21%  0.27%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-11-05  0.18%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-10-21  0.13%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-10-06  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 8  2023-08-26  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-06-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-04-17  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-22  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bareos/bareos/pull/1119", "ref_desc": "Add PAM authorization by arogge \u00b7 Pull Request #1119 \u00b7 bareos/bareos \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-iolmw-d3GJGjY6Gw3xJ8czdQzY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bareos/bareos/security/advisories/GHSA-jh55-4wgw-xc9j", "ref_desc": "Memory Leak in Bareos Director's PAM authentication may lead to Denial of Service \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bareos/bareos \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/480121f2-bc3c-427e-986e-5acffb1606c5/", "ref_desc": "Improper Authorization and possible DoS when using PAM Auth vulnerability found in bareosExploit;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/P68hyGLeP-vJKrzhx6IcXVlN6vQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bareos/bareos/pull/1121", "ref_desc": "Add PAM authorization by arogge \u00b7 Pull Request #1121 \u00b7 bareos/bareos \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vioZs6tcqtor3fOkJobgypjydsI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bareos/bareos/pull/1115", "ref_desc": "dird: Add PAM authorization by arogge \u00b7 Pull Request #1115 \u00b7 bareos/bareos \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZVTOpfVZDTpExFIV6FYfGc7Ly5o.html"}]}
