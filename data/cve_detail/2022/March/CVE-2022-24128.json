{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24128", "Description": "Timescale TimescaleDB 1.x and 2.x before 2.5.2 may allow privilege escalation during extension installation. The installation process uses commands such as CREATE x IF NOT EXIST that allow an unprivileged user to precreate objects. These objects will be used by the installer (which executes as Superuser), leading to privilege escalation. In order to be able to take advantage of this, an unprivileged user would need to be able to create objects in a database and then get a Superuser to install TimescaleDB into their database. (In the fixed versions, the installation aborts when it finds that an object already exists.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24128", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nTimescale\u00bbTimescaledbVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:timescale:timescaledb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-28  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.10%  0.17%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-10-04  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-24  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-20  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/overview/release-notes/", "ref_desc": "Release notes | Timescale DocsRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/security/advisories/GHSA-fh8v-663w-79w9", "ref_desc": "TimescaleDB 1.x and 2.x through 2.5.1 has incorrect access control \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 timescale/timescaledb \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/commit/c8b8516e466c2bb7d2ae6a4b0b2e8e60b24b24a2", "ref_desc": "Fix extension installation privilege escalation \u00b7 timescale/timescaledb@c8b8516 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/commit/6275c2985927cfd4900b85cac5120227c8cb1f0c", "ref_desc": "Fix extension installation privilege escalation \u00b7 timescale/timescaledb@6275c29 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
