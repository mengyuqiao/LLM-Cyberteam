{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24720", "Description": "image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24720", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nImage Processing Project\u00bbImage Processing\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 1.12.2cpe:2.3:a:image_processing_project:image_processing:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.44%  0.49%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-11-14  0.40%  0.44%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-10-05  0.34%  0.40%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-05-23  0.28%  0.34%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-10-21  0.22%  0.28%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-10-07  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-09-22  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-08-12  0.14%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-07-08  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 10  2023-07-04  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-04-03  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-03-08  0.06%  0.14%  +0.08 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/janko/image_processing/commit/038e4574e8f4f4b636a62394e09983c71980dada", "ref_desc": "Prevent remote shell execution in `#apply` \u00b7 janko/image_processing@038e457 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5310", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5310-1 ruby-image-processingThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/janko/image_processing/security/advisories/GHSA-cxf7-qrc5-9446", "ref_desc": "Remote shell execution vulnerability in ImageProcessing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 janko/image_processing \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
