{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24738", "Description": "Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. In versions of evmos prior to 2.0.1 attackers are able to drain unclaimed funds from user addresses. To do this an attacker must create a new chain which does not enforce signature verification and connects it to the target evmos instance. The attacker can use this joined chain to transfer unclaimed funds. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24738", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nEvmos\u00bbEvmosVersions  before (<) 2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:evmos:evmos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.28%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-11  0.24%  0.28%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.21%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-07-08  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-09-28  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-08-18  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-04-09  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-14  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/security/advisories/GHSA-5jgq-x857-p8xw", "ref_desc": "Malicious Migration of Claimable Amount through IBC \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tharsis/evmos \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v2.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.0.1 \u00b7 tharsis/evmos \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/commit/28870258d4ee9f1b8aeef5eba891681f89348f71", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5jgq-x857-p8xw \u00b7 tharsis/evmos@2887025 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
