XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access. This issue is fixed in Apache Any23 2.7.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25312", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbAny23Versions  before (<) 2.7cpe:2.3:a:apache:any23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-17  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-10-08  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-02-29  0.20%  0.18%  -0.02 \n 5  2024-02-17  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-09-25  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 7  2023-08-15  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-04-06  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-24  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 10  2023-03-11  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/03/04/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2022-25312: An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability exists in the Apache Any23 RDFa XSLTStylesheet extractorMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/y6cm5n3ksohsrhzqknqhzy7p3mtkyk23", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-25312: An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability exists in the Apache Any23 RDFa XSLTStylesheet extractor-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
