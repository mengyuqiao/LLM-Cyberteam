{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-25364", "Description": "In Gradle Enterprise before 2021.4.2, the default built-in build cache configuration allowed anonymous write access. If this was not manually changed, a malicious actor with network access to the build cache could potentially populate it with manipulated entries that execute malicious code as part of a build. As of 2021.4.2, the built-in build cache is inaccessible-by-default, requiring explicit configuration of its access-control settings before it can be used. (Remote build cache nodes are unaffected as they are inaccessible-by-default.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25364", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGradle\u00bbEnterpriseVersions  before (<) 2021.4.2cpe:2.3:a:gradle:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-30  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-10-08  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-28  0.19%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-04-19  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-24  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gradle.com", "ref_desc": "Gradle Enterprise - Security Advisories | Gradle Inc.Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Nx3JUPFsABnDrVfU9wxisWcE-vk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gradle.com/advisory/2022-02", "ref_desc": "Gradle Enterprise - Security Advisories | Gradle Inc.Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
