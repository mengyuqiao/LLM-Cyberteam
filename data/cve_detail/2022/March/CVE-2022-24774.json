{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24774", "Description": "CycloneDX BOM Repository Server is a bill of materials (BOM) repository server for distributing CycloneDX BOMs. CycloneDX BOM Repository Server before version 2.0.1 has an improper input validation vulnerability leading to path traversal. A malicious user may potentially exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary directories or a denial of service by deleting arbitrary directories. The vulnerability is resolved in version 2.0.1. The vulnerability is not exploitable with the default configuration with the post and delete methods disabled. This can be configured by modifying the `appsettings.json` file, or alternatively, setting the environment variables `ALLOWEDMETHODS__POST` and `ALLOWEDMETHODS__DELETE` to `false`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24774", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCyclonedx\u00bbBill Of Materials Repository ServerVersions  before (<) 2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cyclonedx:bill_of_materials_repository_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-11-11  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-28  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-13  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-15  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-29  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-35 Path Traversal: '.../...//'", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/35/Path-Traversal-...-...-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-bom-repo-server/commit/001a3278b5572e52c0ecac0bd1157bf2599502b7", "ref_desc": "Security release - remediation of CVE-2022-24774 \u00b7 CycloneDX/cyclonedx-bom-repo-server@001a327 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-bom-repo-server/releases/tag/v2.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release 2.0.1 \u00b7 CycloneDX/cyclonedx-bom-repo-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-bom-repo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-6c74-9588-wq9j", "ref_desc": "Improper input validation vulnerability leading to arbitrary creation of directories and a denial of service by deleting arbitrary directories. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CycloneDX/cyclonedx-bom-repo-server \u00b7 GitHuThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
