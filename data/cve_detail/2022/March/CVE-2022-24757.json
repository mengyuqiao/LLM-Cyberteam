{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24757", "Description": "The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications. Prior to version 1.15.4, unauthorized actors can access sensitive information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter Server logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter Server version 1.15.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24757", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbJupyter ServerVersions  before (<) 1.15.4cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyter_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-12-06  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-27  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-15  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-03  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-25  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-30  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-p737-p57g-4cpr", "ref_desc": "Sensitive Auth & Cookie data stored in Jupyter server logs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/a5683aca0b0e412672ac6218d09f74d44ca0de5a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-p737-p57g-4cpr \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server@a5683ac \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
