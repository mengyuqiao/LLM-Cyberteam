{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-20001", "Description": "fish is a command line shell. fish version 3.1.0 through version 3.3.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that change the behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using the default configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this issue. As a workaround, remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from the prompt.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20001", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFishshell\u00bbFishVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.3.1cpe:2.3:a:fishshell:fish:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-27  0.27%  0.30%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-22  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-11-03  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-10-20  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-10-01  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-06-19  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-04-16  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.72%  0.06%  -1.66 \n 11  2023-02-22  3.07%  1.72%  -1.35 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BPZ7JV22DSZB5LNUCUEJ2HO3PKM2TVVK/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: fish-3.4.1-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.4.0", "ref_desc": "Release fish 3.4.0 (released March 12, 2022) \u00b7 fish-shell/fish-shell \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5234", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5234-1 fishThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/security/advisories/GHSA-pj5f-6vxj-f5mq", "ref_desc": "Navigating to a compromised git repository may lead to arbitrary code exection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fish-shell/fish-shell \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/8589", "ref_desc": "fish_git_prompt: be careful about git config by ridiculousfish \u00b7 Pull Request #8589 \u00b7 fish-shell/fish-shell \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-10", "ref_desc": "Fish: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code (GLSA 202309-10) \u2014 Gentoo security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TRNMYS2LKB6TKOOBQQRSRQICDMWLZ4QL/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: fish-3.4.1-1.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
