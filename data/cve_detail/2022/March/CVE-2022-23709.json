{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-23709", "Description": "A flaw was discovered in Kibana in which users with Read access to the Uptime feature could modify alerting rules. A user with this privilege would be able to create new alerting rules or overwrite existing ones. However, any new or modified rules would not be enabled, and a user with this privilege could not modify alerting connectors. This effectively means that Read users could disable existing alerting rules.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23709", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbKibanaVersions  from including (>=) 7.7.0andbefore (<) 7.17.1cpe:2.3:a:elastic:kibana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nElastic\u00bbKibana\u00bbVersion:8.0.0cpe:2.3:a:elastic:kibana:8.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-7-17-1-security-update/298447", "ref_desc": "Elastic Stack 7.17.1 Security Update - Announcements / Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oT8wA4Uzq3FIosJv8MenH0cchqc.html"}]}
