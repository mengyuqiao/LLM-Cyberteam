{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24760", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24760", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.10.7cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Canonical\u00bbUbuntu Linux\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "37.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  10.31%  37.79%  +27.48 \n 2  2024-11-24  9.73%  10.31%  +0.59 \n 3  2024-10-15  8.41%  9.73%  +1.32 \n 4  2024-08-23  8.14%  8.41%  +0.26 \n 5  2024-06-02  6.45%  8.14%  +1.69 \n 6  2023-12-29  7.36%  6.45%  -0.90 \n 7  2023-10-31  6.93%  7.36%  +0.42 \n 8  2023-10-17  8.25%  6.93%  -1.32 \n 9  2023-10-02  8.16%  8.25%  +0.10 \n 10  2023-08-22  9.19%  8.16%  -1.03 \n 11  2023-06-03  10.44%  9.19%  -1.25 \n 12  2023-04-13  9.87%  10.44%  +0.56 \n 13  2023-03-31  7.93%  9.87%  +1.95 \n 14  2023-03-18  4.82%  7.93%  +3.11 \n 15  2023-03-07  5.63%  4.82%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/886bfd7cac69496e3f73d4bb536f0eec3cba0e4d", "ref_desc": "fix: security vulnerability that allows remote code execution (ghsa p\u2026 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@886bfd7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/ac24b343-e7da-4bc7-ab38-4f4f5cc9d099/", "ref_desc": "Command Injection vulnerability found in parse-serverExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm", "ref_desc": "Command injection via prototype pollution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
