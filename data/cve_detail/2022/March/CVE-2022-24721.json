{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24721", "Description": "CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24721", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCometd\u00bbCometdVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.0.6cpe:2.3:a:cometd:cometd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCometd\u00bbCometdVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.6cpe:2.3:a:cometd:cometd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCometd\u00bbCometdVersions  before (<) 5.0.11cpe:2.3:a:cometd:cometd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-02-28  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-06  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-22  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cometd/cometd/security/advisories/GHSA-rjmq-6v55-4rjv", "ref_desc": "Improper Authorization in org.cometd.oort \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cometd/cometd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cometd/cometd/issues/1146", "ref_desc": "Review Oort/Seti channel usage \u00b7 Issue #1146 \u00b7 cometd/cometd \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
