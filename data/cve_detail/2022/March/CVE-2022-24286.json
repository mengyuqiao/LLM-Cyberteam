{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24286", "Description": "Acer QuickAccess 2.01.300x before 2.01.3030 and 3.00.30xx before 3.00.3038 contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability. The user process communicates with a service of system authority through a named pipe. In this case, the Named Pipe is also given Read and Write rights to the general user. In addition, the service program does not verify the user when communicating. A thread may exist with a specific command. When the path of the program to be executed is sent, there is a local privilege escalation in which the service program executes the path with system privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24286", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAcer\u00bbQuickaccessVersions  from including (>=) 2.01.3000andbefore (<) 2.01.3030cpe:2.3:a:acer:quickaccess:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAcer\u00bbQuickaccessVersions  from including (>=) 3.00.3000andbefore (<) 3.00.3038cpe:2.3:a:acer:quickaccess:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://community.acer.com/en/kb/articles/14762", "ref_desc": "Acer Quick Access requires an update to resolve a security vulnerability - Acer CommunityMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
