{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-0759", "Description": "A flaw was found in all versions of kubeclient up to (but not including) v4.9.3, the Ruby client for Kubernetes REST API, in the way it parsed kubeconfig files. When the kubeconfig file does not configure custom CA to verify certs, kubeclient ends up accepting any certificate (it wrongly returns VERIFY_NONE). Ruby applications that leverage kubeclient to parse kubeconfig files are susceptible to Man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0759", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbKubeclient\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 4.9.3cpe:2.3:a:redhat:kubeclient:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-12-08  0.11%  0.10%  0.00 \n 3  2024-10-29  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 4  2023-10-16  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-05  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 6  2023-04-01  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ManageIQ/kubeclient/issues/554", "ref_desc": "VULNERABILITY: `Config` defaults to `VERIFY_NONE` when kubeconfig doesn't specify custom CA \u00b7 Issue #554 \u00b7 ManageIQ/kubeclient \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ManageIQ/kubeclient/issues/555", "ref_desc": "`Config` ignores `insecure-skip-tls-verify` field \u00b7 Issue #555 \u00b7 ManageIQ/kubeclient \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
