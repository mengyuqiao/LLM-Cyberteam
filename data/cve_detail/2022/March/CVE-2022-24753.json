{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24753", "Description": "Stripe CLI is a command-line tool for the Stripe eCommerce platform. A vulnerability in Stripe CLI exists on Windows when certain commands are run in a directory where an attacker has planted files. The commands are `stripe login`, `stripe config -e`, `stripe community`, and `stripe open`. MacOS and Linux are unaffected. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The update addresses the vulnerability by throwing an error in these situations before the code can run.Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.7.13. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24753", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nStripe\u00bbStripe CliVersions  before (<) 1.7.13cpe:2.3:a:stripe:stripe_cli:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/security/advisories/GHSA-4cx6-fj7j-pjx9", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in Stripe CLI < 1.7.13 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 stripe/stripe-cli \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/commit/be38da5c0191adb77f661f769ffff2fbc7ddf6cd", "ref_desc": "replace exec package (#820) \u00b7 stripe/stripe-cli@be38da5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
