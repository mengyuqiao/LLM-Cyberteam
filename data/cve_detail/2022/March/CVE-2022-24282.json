{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24282", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC NMS (All versions >= V1.0.3 < V2.0), SINEC NMS (All versions < V1.0.3), SINEMA Server V14 (All versions). The affected system allows to upload JSON objects that are deserialized to Java objects. Due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, a privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized Java object. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24282", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbSinec Network Management SystemVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.3cpe:2.3:a:siemens:sinec_network_management_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.04%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-09-29  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 4  2023-04-10  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-15  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.05%  -1.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-250085.pdf", "ref_desc": "Mitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Hqm5Y6fkgcrtJ5dOrcONupLDsK0.html"}]}
