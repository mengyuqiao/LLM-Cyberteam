{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24719", "Description": "Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24719", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFluture-node Project\u00bbFluture-node\u00bbVersion:4.0.0ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:fluture-node_project:fluture-node:4.0.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nFluture-node Project\u00bbFluture-node\u00bbVersion:4.0.1ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:fluture-node_project:fluture-node:4.0.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-11-14  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-05  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-09-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-22  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 6  2023-08-12  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-04  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-04-03  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/212/Improper-Removal-of-Sensitive-Information-Before-Storage-or-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-359 Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/359/Exposure-of-Private-Personal-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/commit/0c99bc511533d48be17dc6bfe641f7d0aeb34d77", "ref_desc": "Fix notion of cross-origin to include scheme changes \u00b7 fluture-js/fluture-node@0c99bc5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/security/advisories/GHSA-32x6-qvw6-mxj4", "ref_desc": "Forwarding of confidentials headers to third parties in fluture-node \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fluture-js/fluture-node \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/commit/125e4474f910c1507f8ec3232848626fbc0f55c4", "ref_desc": "Update redirection strategies to drop confidential headers \u00b7 fluture-js/fluture-node@125e447 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/4718", "ref_desc": "Strip Authorization header whenever root URL changes by bmerry \u00b7 Pull Request #4718 \u00b7 psf/requests \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
