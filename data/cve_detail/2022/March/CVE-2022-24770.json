{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24770", "Description": "`gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24770", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGradio Project\u00bbGradio\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 2.8.11cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-30  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.24%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-25  0.21%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-11-06  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-23  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-10-08  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-08-28  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-04-19  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-24  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1236 Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1236/Improper-Neutralization-of-Formula-Elements-in-a-CSV-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/80fea89117358ee105973453fdc402398ae20239", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #817 from gradio-app/csv-sec \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio@80fea89 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/817", "ref_desc": "Sanitize flagging inputs before writing to csv by abidlabs \u00b7 Pull Request #817 \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-f8xq-q7px-wg8c", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File in Gradio Flagging \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
