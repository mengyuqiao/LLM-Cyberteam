{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36092", "Description": "XWiki Platform Old Core is a core package for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Prior to versions 14.2 and 13.10.4, all rights checks that would normally prevent a user from viewing a document on a wiki can be bypassed using the login action and directly specified templates. This exposes title, content and comments of any document and properties of objects, though class and property name must be known. This is also exploitable on private wikis. This has been patched in versions 14.2 and 13.10.4 by properly checking view rights before loading documents and disallowing non-default templates in the login, registration and skin action. As a workaround, it would be possible to protect all templates individually by adding code to check access rights first.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36092", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  before (<) 13.10.4cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-31  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 2  2024-02-19  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-14  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-15  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-09  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/9b7057d57a941592d763992d4299456300918208", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19549: Disallow template override for login, register and skin \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@9b7057d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18602", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-18602] Dataleak on fully-private Wiki on Delete page - XWiki.org JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19549", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19549] Page content, object properties and title leak on fully private wiki with xpages on the login action - XWiki.org JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-8h89-34w2-jpfm", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass Using the Login Action in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/71a6d0bb6f8ab718fcfaae0e9b8c16c2d69cd4bb", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19549: Disallow template override for login, register and skin \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@71a6d0b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
