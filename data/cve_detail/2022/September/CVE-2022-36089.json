{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36089", "Description": "KubeVela is an application delivery platform Users using KubeVela's VelaUX APIServer could be affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. In KubeVela prior to versions 1.4.11 and 1.5.4, VelaUX APIServer uses the `PlatformID` as the signed key to generate the JWT tokens for users. Another API called `getSystemInfo` exposes the platformID. This vulnerability allows users to use the platformID to re-generate the JWT tokens to bypass the authentication. Versions 1.4.11 and 1.5.4 contain a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36089", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKubevela\u00bbKubevelaVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 1.5.3cpe:2.3:a:kubevela:kubevela:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKubevela\u00bbKubevelaVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.4.11cpe:2.3:a:kubevela:kubevela:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.20%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-03-30  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-18  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-10-10  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-14  0.11%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-08-08  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/security/advisories/GHSA-cq42-w295-r29q", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay in VelaUX APIServer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kubevela/kubevela \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/pull/4634", "ref_desc": "Fix: fix signedKey using platform id by FogDong \u00b7 Pull Request #4634 \u00b7 kubevela/kubevela \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
