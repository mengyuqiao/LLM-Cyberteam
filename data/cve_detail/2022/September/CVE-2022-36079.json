{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36079", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36079", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.10.14cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.2.5cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-30  0.18%  0.17%  0.00 \n 2  2024-02-18  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-12-13  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-10  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-14  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-08-08  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.08%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/634c44acd18f6ee6ec60fac89a2b602d92799bec", "ref_desc": "fix: brute force guessing of user sensitive data via search patterns;\u2026 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@634c44a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-2m6g-crv8-p3c6", "ref_desc": "Brute force guessing of user sensitive data via search patterns \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/5.2.5", "ref_desc": "Release 5.2.5 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/issues/8144", "ref_desc": "fix: brute force guessing of user sensitive data via search patterns (GHSA-2m6g-crv8-p3c6) by mtrezza \u00b7 Pull Request #8144 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/issues/8143", "ref_desc": "fix: brute force guessing of user sensitive data via search patterns (GHSA-2m6g-crv8-p3c6) by mtrezza \u00b7 Pull Request #8143 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/4.10.14", "ref_desc": "Release 4.10.14 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/e39d51bd329cd978589983bd659db46e1d45aad4", "ref_desc": "fix: brute force guessing of user sensitive data via search patterns;\u2026 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@e39d51b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
