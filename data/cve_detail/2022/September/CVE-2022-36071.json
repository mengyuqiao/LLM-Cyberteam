{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36071", "Description": "SFTPGo is configurable SFTP server with optional HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV support. SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords) as a secondary authentication factor. Because TOTPs are often configured on mobile devices that can be lost, stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery codes. These are a set of one time use codes that can be used instead of the TOTP. In SFTPGo versions from version 2.2.0 to 2.3.3 recovery codes can be generated before enabling two-factor authentication. An attacker who knows the user's password could potentially generate some recovery codes and then bypass two-factor authentication after it is enabled on the account at a later time. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.4. Recovery codes can now only be generated after enabling two-factor authentication and are deleted after disabling it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36071", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSftpgo Project\u00bbSftpgoVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:sftpgo_project:sftpgo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-03-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-09  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/issues/965", "ref_desc": "TOTP Generate Recovery Codes MFA \u00b7 Issue #965 \u00b7 drakkan/sftpgo \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/security/advisories/GHSA-54qx-8p8w-xhg8", "ref_desc": "Recovery codes abuse \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 drakkan/sftpgo \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
