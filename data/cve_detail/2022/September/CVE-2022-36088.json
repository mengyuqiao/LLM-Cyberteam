{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36088", "Description": "GoCD is a continuous delivery server. Windows installations via either the server or agent installers for GoCD prior to 22.2.0 do not adequately restrict permissions when installing outside of the default location. This could allow a malicious user with local access to the server GoCD Server or Agent are installed on to modify executables or components of the installation. This does not affect zip file-based installs, installations to other platforms, or installations inside `Program Files` or `Program Files (x86)`. This issue is fixed in GoCD 22.2.0 installers. As a workaround, if the server or agent is installed outside of `Program Files (x86)`, verify the the permission of the Server or Agent installation directory to ensure the `Everyone` user group does not have `Full Control`, `Modify` or `Write` permissions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36088", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  before (<) 22.2.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#22-2-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-gpv4-xqhc-5vcj", "ref_desc": "Windows installations outside default location inadequately restrict installation file permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/96add9605096ab50c5cd4c229be1d503aff506a6", "ref_desc": "Add NSIS AccessControl plugin to set permissions on install dir \u00b7 gocd/gocd@96add96 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/22.2.0", "ref_desc": "Release GoCD 22.2.0 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
