{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39251", "Description": "Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. Starting with version 19.7.0, matrix-js-sdk has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39251", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbJavascript Sdk\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 19.7.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:javascript_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 2  2024-04-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-10  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-03  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-31  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-10-05  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-08-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-322 Key Exchange without Entity Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/322/Key-Exchange-without-Entity-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-35", "ref_desc": "Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202210-35) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-SpHnfl23DBlUIts3gE3aubrSeg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/a587d7c36026fe1fcf93dfff63588abee359be76", "ref_desc": "Resolve multiple CVEs \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk@a587d7c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eDOAomlXwOGe9qjFeUuUUc3rvpU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-r48r-j8fx-mq2c", "ref_desc": "Olm/Megolm protocol confusion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients", "ref_desc": "Upgrade now to address E2EE vulnerabilities in matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2 | Matrix.orgVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/M0cEKVJibKxbSiyBnfkDcFWKlmo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases/tag/v19.7.0", "ref_desc": "Release v19.7.0 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s0I6yTKRmv3EyKvbridobc9JZvg.html"}]}
