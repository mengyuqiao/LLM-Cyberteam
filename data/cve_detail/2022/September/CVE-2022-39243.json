{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39243", "Description": "NuProcess is an external process execution implementation for Java. In all the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec method (1.2.0+), attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command line injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start. NuProcess is missing that check. This vulnerability can only be exploited to inject command line arguments on Linux. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch. As a workaround, users of the library can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters prior to passing them to NuProcess for execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39243", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNuprocess Project\u00bbNuprocessVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andbefore (<) 2.0.5cpe:2.3:a:nuprocess_project:nuprocess:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-18  0.49%  0.64%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.53%  0.49%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-10-22  0.38%  0.53%  +0.16 \n 4  2024-06-15  0.37%  0.38%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-17  0.18%  0.37%  +0.19 \n 6  2024-05-03  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-04-18  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-03-08  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-10-29  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-10-03  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 11  2023-08-27  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-07-14  0.09%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 13  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.09%  -2.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/commit/29bc09de561bf00ff9bf77123756363a9709f868", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #143 from benhumphreys/harden-null-injection \u00b7 brettwooldridge/NuProcess@29bc09d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/security/advisories/GHSA-cxgf-v2p8-7ph7", "ref_desc": "Command-line injection through insertion of NUL character(s) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 brettwooldridge/NuProcess \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/pull/143", "ref_desc": "Null injection hardening by benhumphreys \u00b7 Pull Request #143 \u00b7 brettwooldridge/NuProcess \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
