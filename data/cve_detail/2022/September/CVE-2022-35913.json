{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35913", "Description": "Samourai Wallet Stonewallx2 0.99.98e allows a denial of service via a P2P coinjoin. The attacker and victim must follow each other's paynym. Then, the victim must try to collaborate with the attacker for a Stonewallx2 transaction. Next, the attacker broadcasts a tx, spending the inputs used in Stonewallx2 before the victim can broadcast the collaborative transaction. The attacker does not signal opt in RBF, and uses the lowest fee rate. This would result in the victim being unable to perform Stonewallx2. (Note that the attacker could use multiple paynyms.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35913", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nKayako\u00bbSamourai\u00bbVersion:0.99.98ecpe:2.3:a:kayako:samourai:0.99.98e:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-03-29  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-09  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-13  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-June/020595.html", "ref_desc": "[bitcoin-dev] Playing with full-rbf peers for fun and L2s securityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-July/020737.html", "ref_desc": "[bitcoin-dev] Full Disclosure: Denial of Service in STONEWALLx2 (p2p coinjoin)Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
