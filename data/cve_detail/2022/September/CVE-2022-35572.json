{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35572", "Description": "On Linksys E5350 WiFi Router with firmware version 1.0.00.037 and lower, (and potentially other vendors/devices due to code reuse), the /SysInfo.htm URI does not require a session ID. This web page calls a show_sysinfo function which retrieves WPA passwords, SSIDs, MAC Addresses, serial numbers, WPS Pins, and hardware/firmware versions, and prints this information into the web page. This web page is visible when remote management is enabled. A user who has access to the web interface of the device can extract these secrets. If the device has remote management enabled and is connected directly to the internet, this vulnerability is exploitable over the internet without interaction.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35572", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nLinksys\u00bbE5350 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.00.037cpe:2.3:o:linksys:e5350_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linksys\u00bbE5350\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-04-04  0.18%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-23  0.17%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-15  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-19  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-08-13  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://willgu.es/?p=76", "ref_desc": "Linksys E5350 Password Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2022-35572) | Willgues Security BlogExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
