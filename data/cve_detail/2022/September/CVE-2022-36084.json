{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36084", "Description": "cruddl is software for creating a GraphQL API for a database, using the GraphQL SDL to model a schema. If cruddl starting with version 1.1.0 and prior to versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.2 is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB. Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected. The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled. The issue has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl. As a workaround, users can temporarily remove `@flexSearchFulltext` from their schemas.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36084", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAEB\u00bbCruddl\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.2cpe:2.3:a:aeb:cruddl:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nAEB\u00bbCruddl\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:aeb:cruddl:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-29  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-04-15  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-31  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-19  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-15  0.09%  0.16%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-08-09  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-943 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/943/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Data-Query-Lo.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl/pull/253", "ref_desc": "Use regular aql framework for felx search expression tokenization by Yogu \u00b7 Pull Request #253 \u00b7 AEB-labs/cruddl \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl/commit/13b9233733ed6fc822718a07bc90a80cd3492698", "ref_desc": "Use regular aql framework for flex search expression tokenization \u00b7 AEB-labs/cruddl@13b9233 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl/security/advisories/GHSA-qm4w-4995-vg7f", "ref_desc": "AQL injection through flexSearch in cruddl \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 AEB-labs/cruddl \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
