{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36054", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. The 6LoWPAN implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system (file os/net/ipv6/sicslowpan.c) contains an input function that processes incoming packets and copies them into a packet buffer. Because of a missing length check in the input function, it is possible to write outside the packet buffer's boundary. The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who has the possibility to send 6LoWPAN packets to a Contiki-NG system. In particular, the vulnerability is exposed when sending either of two types of 6LoWPAN packets: an unfragmented packet or the first fragment of a fragmented packet. If the packet is sufficiently large, a subsequent memory copy will cause an out-of-bounds write with data supplied by the attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36054", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  before (<) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-12  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-08  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1648", "ref_desc": "uipbuf: Do not assume that there is enough space for a following extension header by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #1648 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ObcDJ2nI6mEYgyP_dvhO97MAi5s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-c36p-vhwg-244c", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds write when decompressing 6LoWPAN payload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
