{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39218", "Description": "The JS Compute Runtime for Fastly's Compute@Edge platform provides the environment JavaScript is executed in when using the Compute@Edge JavaScript SDK. In versions prior to 0.5.3, the `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` methods fail to use sufficiently random values. The initial value to seed the PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) is baked-in to the final WebAssembly module, making the sequence of random values for that specific WebAssembly module predictable. An attacker can use the fixed seed to predict random numbers generated by these functions and bypass cryptographic security controls, for example to disclose sensitive data encrypted by functions that use these generators. The problem has been patched in version 0.5.3. No known workarounds exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39218", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFastly\u00bbJs-compute\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.5.3cpe:2.3:a:fastly:js-compute:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.20%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-04-12  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-02  0.21%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-27  0.15%  0.21%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-08-21  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-335 Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/335/Incorrect-Usage-of-Seeds-in-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastly/js-compute-runtime/security/advisories/GHSA-cmr8-5w4c-44v8", "ref_desc": "Random number seed fixed during compilation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fastly/js-compute-runtime \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
