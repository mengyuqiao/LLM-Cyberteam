{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-41352", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0. An attacker can upload arbitrary files through amavis via a cpio loophole (extraction to /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/public) that can lead to incorrect access to any other user accounts. Zimbra recommends pax over cpio. Also, pax is in the prerequisites of Zimbra on Ubuntu; however, pax is no longer part of a default Red Hat installation after RHEL 6 (or CentOS 6). Once pax is installed, amavis automatically prefers it over cpio.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41352", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nZimbra\u00bbCollaboration\u00bbVersion:8.8.15cpe:2.3:a:zimbra:collaboration:8.8.15:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZimbra\u00bbCollaboration\u00bbVersion:9.0.0cpe:2.3:a:zimbra:collaboration:9.0.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "91.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  94.86%  91.51%  -3.34 \n 2  2024-12-03  94.37%  94.86%  +0.49 \n 3  2024-11-19  94.63%  94.37%  -0.26 \n 4  2024-10-22  94.05%  94.63%  +0.58 \n 5  2024-10-09  92.69%  94.05%  +1.36 \n 6  2024-09-22  93.27%  92.69%  -0.58 \n 7  2024-09-10  92.21%  93.27%  +1.07 \n 8  2024-08-10  95.46%  92.21%  -3.25 \n 9  2024-05-17  95.80%  95.46%  -0.35 \n 10  2024-05-03  95.67%  95.80%  +0.13 \n 11  2024-04-18  95.54%  95.67%  +0.13 \n 12  2024-04-05  95.69%  95.54%  -0.15 \n 13  2024-03-21  95.84%  95.69%  -0.15 \n 14  2024-03-08  96.18%  95.84%  -0.33 \n 15  2024-02-10  96.27%  96.18%  -0.10 \n 16  2024-02-01  96.10%  96.27%  +0.17 \n 17  2024-01-13  95.89%  96.10%  +0.21 \n 18  2023-12-31  95.84%  95.89%  +0.05 \n 19  2023-12-18  95.76%  95.84%  +0.08 \n 20  2023-12-05  95.97%  95.76%  -0.22 \n 21  2023-11-09  96.08%  95.97%  -0.11 \n 22  2023-10-28  95.71%  96.08%  +0.37 \n 23  2023-10-15  95.67%  95.71%  +0.03 \n 24  2023-10-10  96.45%  95.67%  -0.77 \n 25  2023-10-02  96.58%  96.45%  -0.13 \n 26  2023-09-21  96.61%  96.58%  -0.03 \n 27  2023-08-26  96.61%  96.61%  +0.00 \n 28  2023-08-15  96.57%  96.61%  +0.04 \n 29  2023-07-22  96.68%  96.57%  -0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/169458/Zimbra-Collaboration-Suite-TAR-Path-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Zimbra Collaboration Suite TAR Path Traversal \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/aAJLxxKAuNbtrtfZg1ItZ10i9nQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories", "ref_desc": "Zimbra Security Advisories - Zimbra :: Tech CenterVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kOnPele4R_TXr_u1v-Ey_Rmnfh0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security_Center", "ref_desc": "Security Center - Zimbra :: Tech CenterPatch;Release Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kU3UtINP2ddOikS-kqS16OMqTJ8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.secpod.com/blog/unpatched-rce-bug-in-zimbra-collaboration-suite-exploited-in-wild/", "ref_desc": "Zimbra Collaboration Suite vulnerability CVE-2022-41352Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://forums.zimbra.org/viewtopic.php?t=71153&p=306532", "ref_desc": "Attacker managed to upload files into Web Client directory - Zimbra ForumsMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
