{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39063", "Description": "When Open5GS UPF receives a PFCP Session Establishment Request, it stores related values for building the PFCP Session Establishment Response. Once UPF receives a request, it gets the f_teid_len from incoming message, and then uses it to copy data from incoming message to struct f_teid without checking the maximum length. If the pdi.local_f_teid.len exceeds the maximum length of the struct of f_teid, the memcpy() overwrites the fields (e.g., f_teid_len) after f_teid in the pdr struct. After parsing the request, the UPF starts to build a response. The f_teid_len with its overwritten value is used as a length for memcpy(). A segmentation fault occurs, as a result of a memcpy(), if this overwritten value is large enough.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39063", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nOpen5gs\u00bbOpen5gsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.4.9cpe:2.3:a:open5gs:open5gs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-04-08  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-23  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-676 Use of Potentially Dangerous Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/676/Use-of-Potentially-Dangerous-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cyrc-advisory-open5gs/", "ref_desc": "CyRC Vulnerability Advisory: Denial-of-service vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-39063) in Open5GS | SynopsysExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
