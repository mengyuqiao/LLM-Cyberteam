{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36064", "Description": "Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability impacts users that use Shescape to escape arguments for the Unix shells `Bash` and `Dash`, or any not-officially-supported Unix shell; and/or using the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. An attacker can cause polynomial backtracking or quadratic runtime in terms of the input string length due to two Regular Expressions in Shescape that are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This bug has been patched in v1.5.10. For `Dash` only, this bug has been patched since v1.5.9. As a workaround, a maximum length can be enforced on input strings to Shescape to reduce the impact of the vulnerability. It is not recommended to try and detect vulnerable input strings, as the logic for this may end up being vulnerable to ReDoS itself.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36064", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nShescape Project\u00bbShescape\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.1andbefore (<) 1.5.10cpe:2.3:a:shescape_project:shescape:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.19%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-11-28  0.17%  0.22%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-04-27  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-13  0.12%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-03-29  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-02-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-09-13  0.06%  0.10%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-08-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 \n 10  2023-02-23  11.98%  0.95%  -11.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.10", "ref_desc": "Release Release v1.5.10 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-gp75-h7j6-5pv3", "ref_desc": "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in shescape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/373", "ref_desc": "Lint regular expressions by ericcornelissen \u00b7 Pull Request #373 \u00b7 ericcornelissen/shescape \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
