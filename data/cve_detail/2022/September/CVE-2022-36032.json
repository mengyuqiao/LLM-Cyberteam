{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36032", "Description": "ReactPHP HTTP is a streaming HTTP client and server implementation for ReactPHP. In ReactPHP's HTTP server component versions starting with 0.7.0 and prior to 1.7.0, when ReactPHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to cookies with prefixes like `__Host-` and `__Secure-` confused with cookies that decode to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which is supposed to be secure. This issue is fixed in ReactPHP HTTP version 1.7.0. As a workaround, Infrastructure or DevOps can place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any unexpected `Cookie` request headers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36032", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nReactphp\u00bbHttpVersions  from including (>=) 0.7.0andbefore (<) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:reactphp:http:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.17%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-03-29  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2024-02-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-09  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-07  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-565 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/565/Reliance-on-Cookies-without-Validation-and-Integrity-Checkin.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/reactphp/http/releases/tag/v1.7.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.7.0 \u00b7 reactphp/http \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/reactphp/http/pull/175", "ref_desc": "Add cookies to request object by legionth \u00b7 Pull Request #175 \u00b7 reactphp/http \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/reactphp/http/commit/663c9a3b77b71463fa7fcb76a6676ffd16979dd6", "ref_desc": "Do not decode cookie names anymore \u00b7 reactphp/http@663c9a3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/reactphp/http/security/advisories/GHSA-w3w9-vrf5-8mx8", "ref_desc": "ReactPHP's HTTP server parses encoded cookie names so malicious `__Host-` and `__Secure-` cookies can be sent \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 reactphp/http \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
