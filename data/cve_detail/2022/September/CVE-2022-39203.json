{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39203", "Description": "matrix-appservice-irc is an open source Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix. Attackers can specify a specific string of characters, which would confuse the bridge into combining an attacker-owned channel and an existing channel, allowing them to grant themselves permissions in the channel. The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. As a workaround operators may disable dynamic channel joining via `dynamicChannels.enabled` to prevent users from joining new channels, which prevents any new channels being bridged outside of what is already bridged, and what is specified in the config.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39203", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbMatrix Irc Bridge\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.35.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix_irc_bridge:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-04-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-24  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-20  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-08-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-xvqg-mv25-rwvw", "ref_desc": "Parsing issue in matrix-org/node-irc leading to room takeovers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/13/security-release-of-matrix-appservice-irc-0-35-0-high-severity/", "ref_desc": "Security release of matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0 (High severity) | Matrix.orgVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q8PXOgFsWVg5aGp1GDgPJZXZfqA.html"}]}
