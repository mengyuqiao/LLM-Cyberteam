{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36091", "Description": "XWiki Platform Web Templates are templates for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Through the suggestion feature, string and list properties of objects the user shouldn't have access to can be accessed in versions prior to 13.10.4 and 14.2. This includes private personal information like email addresses and salted password hashes of registered users but also other information stored in properties of objects. Sensitive configuration fields like passwords for LDAP or SMTP servers could be accessed. By exploiting an additional vulnerability, this issue can even be exploited on private wikis at least for string properties. The issue is patched in version 13.10.4 and 14.2. Password properties are no longer displayed and rights are checked for other properties. A workaround is available. The template file `suggest.vm` can be replaced by a patched version without upgrading or restarting XWiki unless it has been overridden, in which case the overridden template should be patched, too. This might need adjustments for older versions, though.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36091", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 1.3andbefore (<) 13.10.4cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.13%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-03-31  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-19  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-11  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-15  0.09%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-08-09  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-359 Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/359/Exposure-of-Private-Personal-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18849", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-18849] Private user data are accessible through suggest.vm - XWiki.org JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm", "ref_desc": "Missing Authorization and Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
