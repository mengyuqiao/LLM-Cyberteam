{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39224", "Description": "Arr-pm is an RPM reader/writer library written in Ruby. Versions prior to 0.0.12 are subject to OS command injection resulting in shell execution if the RPM contains a malicious \"payload compressor\" field. This vulnerability impacts the `extract` and `files` methods of the `RPM::File` class of this library. Version 0.0.12 patches these issues. A workaround for this issue is to ensure any RPMs being processed contain valid/known payload compressor values such as gzip, bzip2, xz, zstd, and lzma. The payload compressor field in an rpm can be checked by using the rpm command line tool.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39224", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRuby-arr-pm Project\u00bbRuby-arr-pm\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 0.0.12cpe:2.3:a:ruby-arr-pm_project:ruby-arr-pm:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.12%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-12-13  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-05-12  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-28  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-03  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-10-24  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-09-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.56%  0.06%  -1.50 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/pull/14", "ref_desc": "Refactor RPM::File#files by jordansissel \u00b7 Pull Request #14 \u00b7 jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/pull/15", "ref_desc": "Only attempt extraction if a known payload compressor is used. by jordansissel \u00b7 Pull Request #15 \u00b7 jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/security/advisories/GHSA-88cv-mj24-8w3q", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary shell execution when extracting or listing files contained in a malicious rpm. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
