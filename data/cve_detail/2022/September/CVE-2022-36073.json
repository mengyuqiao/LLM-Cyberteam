{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36073", "Description": "RubyGems.org is the Ruby community gem host. A bug in password & email change confirmation code allowed an attacker to change their RubyGems.org account's email to an unowned email address. Having access to an account whose email has been changed could enable an attacker to save API keys for that account, and when a legitimate user attempts to create an account with their email (and has to reset password to gain access) and is granted access to other gems, the attacker would then be able to publish and yank versions of those gems. Commit number 90c9e6aac2d91518b479c51d48275c57de492d4d contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36073", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRubygems\u00bbRubygemsVersions  before (<) 2022-08-31cpe:2.3:a:rubygems:rubygems:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-30  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-18  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-14  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-08-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/security/advisories/GHSA-8qpf-wf2p-25vg", "ref_desc": "Ability to create users with arbitrary unverified emails \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rubygems/rubygems.org \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/commit/90c9e6aac2d91518b479c51d48275c57de492d4d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8qpf-wf2p-25vg \u00b7 rubygems/rubygems.org@90c9e6a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
