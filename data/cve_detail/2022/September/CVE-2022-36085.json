{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36085", "Description": "Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine. The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and as such rejected \u00e2\u20ac\u201d by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`. Multiple conditions need to be met in order to create an adverse effect. Version 0.43.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function and use the `capabilities` feature instead.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36085", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nOpenpolicyagent\u00bbOpen Policy AgentVersions  from including (>=) 0.40.0andbefore (<) 0.43.1cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.34%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-30  0.23%  0.30%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-04-29  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-04-15  0.16%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-03-31  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 6  2024-02-19  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-01-23  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-12-14  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-10-11  0.10%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-09-15  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.07%  -1.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/security/advisories/GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr", "ref_desc": "Compiler: Bypass of WithUnsafeBuiltins using \"with\" keyword to mock functions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-policy-agent/opa \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/tag/v0.43.1", "ref_desc": "Release v0.43.1 \u00b7 open-policy-agent/opa \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/25a597bc3f4985162e7f65f9c36599f4f8f55823", "ref_desc": "ast/compile: respect unsafeBuiltinMap for 'with' replacements (#5107) \u00b7 open-policy-agent/opa@25a597b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/3e8c754ed007b22393cf65e48751ad9f6457fee8", "ref_desc": "ast/compile: respect unsafeBuiltinMap for 'with' replacements \u00b7 open-policy-agent/opa@3e8c754 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4540", "ref_desc": "compiler: allow for mocking built-in functions via \"with\" by srenatus \u00b7 Pull Request #4540 \u00b7 open-policy-agent/opa \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4616", "ref_desc": "ast+topdown+planner: non-built-in function mocking by srenatus \u00b7 Pull Request #4616 \u00b7 open-policy-agent/opa \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
