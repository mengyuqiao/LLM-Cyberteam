{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36113", "Description": "Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain.\nMitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36113", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nRust-lang\u00bbCargo\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.65.0cpe:2.3:a:rust-lang:cargo:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.40%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-04-06  0.26%  0.27%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-10-17  0.15%  0.26%  +0.11 \n 4  2023-09-21  0.12%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-08-15  0.17%  0.12%  -0.06 \n 6  2023-03-07  4.84%  0.17%  -4.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-09", "ref_desc": "Rust: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202210-09) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Cky_3iN_cRVTOXZy3dYrHl8m7WA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/commit/97b80919e404b0768ea31ae329c3b4da54bed05a", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-36113: avoid unpacking .cargo-ok from the crate \u00b7 rust-lang/cargo@97b8091 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/security/advisories/GHSA-rfj2-q3h3-hm5j", "ref_desc": "Extracting malicious crates can corrupt arbitrary files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-lang/cargo \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
