{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39209", "Description": "cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering library and program in C. In versions prior to 0.29.0.gfm.6 a polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm's autolink extension may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. Users may verify the patch by running `python3 -c 'print(\"![l\"* 100000 + \"\\n\")' | ./cmark-gfm -e autolink`, which will resource exhaust on unpatched cmark-gfm but render correctly on patched cmark-gfm. This vulnerability has been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the use of the autolink extension.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbCmark-gfmVersions  before (<) 0.29.0.gfm.6cpe:2.3:a:github:cmark-gfm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-06  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-22  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-12-21  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-08  0.15%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-09-22  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-08-16  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.10%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-407 Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/407/Inefficient-Algorithmic-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UEAAAI4OULDYQ2TA3HOXH54PC3DCBFZS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: ghc-cmark-gfm-0.2.5-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-cgh3-p57x-9q7q", "ref_desc": "Unbounded resource exhaustion may lead to denial of service \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 github/cmark-gfm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JIUCZN3PEKUCT2JQYQTYOVIJG2KSD6G7/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: ghc-cmark-gfm-0.2.5-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/commit/9d57d8a23142b316282bdfc954cb0ecda40a8655", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-cgh3-p57x-9q7q \u00b7 github/cmark-gfm@9d57d8a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity", "ref_desc": "Time complexity - WikipediaThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMGP65NANDVKPDMXMKYO2ZV2H2HZJY4P/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: ghc-cmark-gfm-0.2.5-1.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
