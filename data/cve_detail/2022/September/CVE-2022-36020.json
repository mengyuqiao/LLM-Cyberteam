{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36020", "Description": "The typo3/html-sanitizer package is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to provide XSS-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. Due to a parsing issue in the upstream package `masterminds/html5`, malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML comments cannot be filtered and sanitized. This allows for a bypass of the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.0.7 and 2.0.16 of the `typo3/html-sanitizer` package. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36020", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbHtml SanitizerVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.0.7cpe:2.3:a:typo3:html_sanitizer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbHtml SanitizerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.16cpe:2.3:a:typo3:html_sanitizer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-04-05  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 3  2024-02-24  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-16  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-20  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-08-14  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-47m6-46mj-p235", "ref_desc": "By-passing Cross-Site Scripting Protection in HTML Sanitizer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/html-sanitizer \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/commit/60bfdc7f9b394d0236e16ee4cea8372a7defa493", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Correctly handle comment end bang state (#86) \u00b7 TYPO3/html-sanitizer@60bfdc7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/html-sanitizer", "ref_desc": "typo3/html-sanitizer - PackagistProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/masterminds/html5", "ref_desc": "masterminds/html5 - PackagistThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
