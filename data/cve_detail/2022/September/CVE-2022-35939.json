{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35939", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The `ScatterNd` function takes an input argument that determines the indices of of the output tensor. An input index greater than the output tensor or less than zero will either write content at the wrong index or trigger a crash. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit b4d4b4cb019bd7240a52daa4ba61e3cc814f0384. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35939", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.8.0andbefore (<) 2.8.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andbefore (<) 2.7.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.10UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.10:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.10UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.10:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.10UpdateRC3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.10:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.10UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.10:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-07  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-08  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-27  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-19  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-23  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-08-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-ffjm-4qwc-7cmf", "ref_desc": "OOB write in `scatter_nd` op in TF Lite \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b4d4b4cb019bd7240a52daa4ba61e3cc814f0384", "ref_desc": "Check bounds for reads and writes in scatter_nd \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@b4d4b4c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/266558ac4c1f361e9a178ee9d3f0ce2e648ae499/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h#L659-L698", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
