{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39227", "Description": "python-jwt is a module for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens. Versions prior to 3.3.4 are subject to Authentication Bypass by Spoofing, resulting in identity spoofing, session hijacking or authentication bypass. An attacker who obtains a JWT can arbitrarily forge its contents without knowing the secret key. Depending on the application, this may for example enable the attacker to spoof other user's identities, hijack their sessions, or bypass authentication. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.4. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39227", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPython-jwt Project\u00bbPython-jwtVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.3.4cpe:2.3:a:python-jwt_project:python-jwt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-11  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-15  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-03-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-01  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 5  2023-09-05  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-08-24  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-06-08  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/commit/88ad9e67c53aa5f7c43ec4aa52ed34b7930068c9", "ref_desc": "FIX VULNERABILITY \u00b7 davedoesdev/python-jwt@88ad9e6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/blob/main/vulns/python-jwt/PYSEC-2022-259.yaml", "ref_desc": "advisory-database/PYSEC-2022-259.yaml at main \u00b7 pypa/advisory-database \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/authentication-bypass-in-python-jwt", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass in Python-Jwt - vsociety", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-5p8v-58qm-c7fp", "ref_desc": "Token forgery with new claims \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 davedoesdev/python-jwt \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
