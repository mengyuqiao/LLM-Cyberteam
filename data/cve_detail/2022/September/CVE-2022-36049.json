{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36049", "Description": "Flux2 is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration, and Flux's helm-controller is a Kubernetes operator that allows one to declaratively manage Helm chart releases. Helm controller is tightly integrated with the Helm SDK. A vulnerability found in the Helm SDK that affects flux2 v0.0.17 until v0.32.0 and helm-controller v0.0.4 until v0.23.0 allows for specific data inputs to cause high memory consumption. In some platforms, this could cause the controller to panic and stop processing reconciliations. In a shared cluster multi-tenancy environment, a tenant could create a HelmRelease that makes the controller panic, denying all other tenants from their Helm releases being reconciled. Patches are available in flux2 v0.32.0 and helm-controller v0.23.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36049", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHelm\u00bbHelmVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.9.4cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFluxcd\u00bbFlux2Versions  from including (>=) 0.0.17andbefore (<) 0.32.0cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:flux2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFluxcd\u00bbHelm-controllerVersions  from including (>=) 0.0.4andbefore (<) 0.23.0cpe:2.3:a:fluxcd:helm-controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-28  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-14  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-30  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 5  2024-02-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-10-10  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-09-14  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-08-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-p2g7-xwvr-rrw3", "ref_desc": "Helm Controller denial of service \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fluxcd/flux2 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh", "ref_desc": "Denial of service through string value parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ReuvvxshX5CZ9myPJl9T5KTx8sU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=44996", "ref_desc": "44996 - helm:fuzz_engine_render: Out-of-memory in fuzz_engine_render - oss-fuzzMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=48360", "ref_desc": "48360 - fluxcd:fuzz_helmrelease_composevalues: Out-of-memory in fuzz_helmrelease_composevalues - oss-fuzzMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
