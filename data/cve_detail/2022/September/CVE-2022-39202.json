{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39202", "Description": "matrix-appservice-irc is an open source Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix. The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol allows you to specify multiple modes in a single mode command. Due to a bug in the underlying matrix-org/node-irc library, affected versions of matrix-appservice-irc perform parsing of such modes incorrectly, potentially resulting in the wrong user being given permissions. Mode commands can only be executed by privileged users, so this can only be abused if an operator is tricked into running the command on behalf of an attacker. The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. As a workaround users should refrain from entering mode commands suggested by untrusted users. Avoid using multiple modes in a single command.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39202", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbMatrix Irc Bridge\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.35.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix_irc_bridge:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-04-05  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-24  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-20  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/commit/5f87dbed87b4b6dc49b7965ff152ee8535719e67", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc@5f87dbe \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/13/security-release-of-matrix-appservice-irc-0-35-0-high-severity/", "ref_desc": "Security release of matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0 (High severity) | Matrix.orgVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q8PXOgFsWVg5aGp1GDgPJZXZfqA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-cq7q-5c67-w39w", "ref_desc": "IRC mode parameter confusion in matrix-org/node-irc \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
