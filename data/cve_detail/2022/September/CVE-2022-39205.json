{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39205", "Description": "Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. In versions of Onedev prior to 7.3.0 unauthenticated users can take over a OneDev instance if there is no properly configured reverse proxy. The /git-prereceive-callback endpoint is used by the pre-receive git hook on the server to check for branch protections during a push event. It is only intended to be accessed from localhost, but the check relies on the X-Forwarded-For header. Invoking this endpoint leads to the execution of one of various git commands. The environment variables of this command execution can be controlled via query parameters. This allows attackers to write to arbitrary files, which can in turn lead to the execution of arbitrary code. Such an attack would be very hard to detect, which increases the potential impact even more. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39205", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOnedev Project\u00bbOnedevVersions  before (<) 7.3.0cpe:2.3:a:onedev_project:onedev:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.35%  0.35%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-17  0.33%  0.35%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-02  0.24%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-05-04  0.19%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-04-05  0.22%  0.19%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-02-24  0.23%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-10-16  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-09-20  0.12%  0.19%  +0.07 \n 9  2023-08-14  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 10  2023-03-29  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.13%  -2.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-4f9h-h82c-4xm2", "ref_desc": "Access Control Bypass can lead to Remote Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 theonedev/onedev \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/f1e97688e4e19d6de1dfa1d00e04655209d39f8e", "ref_desc": "Fix security vulnerability related to Git pre/post receive callback \u00b7 theonedev/onedev@f1e9768 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/releases/tag/v7.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release 7.3.0 \u00b7 theonedev/onedev \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/onedev-remote-code-execution/", "ref_desc": "Securing Developer Tools: OneDev Remote Code ExecutionExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yYSBMZy8-dsJ-7ufSoouO75RZPU.html"}]}
