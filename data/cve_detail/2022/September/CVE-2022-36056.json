{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36056", "Description": "Cosign is a project under the sigstore organization which aims to make signatures invisible infrastructure. In versions prior to 1.12.0 a number of vulnerabilities have been found in cosign verify-blob, where Cosign would successfully verify an artifact when verification should have failed. First a cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully verify a blob even if the embedded rekorBundle does not reference the given signature. Second, when providing identity flags, the email and issuer of a certificate is not checked when verifying a Rekor bundle, and the GitHub Actions identity is never checked. Third, providing an invalid Rekor bundle without the experimental flag results in a successful verification. And fourth an invalid transparency log entry will result in immediate success for verification. Details and examples of these issues can be seen in the GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388 advisory linked. Users are advised to upgrade to 1.12.0. There are no known workarounds for these issues.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36056", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSigstore\u00bbCosignVersions  before (<) 1.12.0cpe:2.3:a:sigstore:cosign:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-06  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388", "ref_desc": "Vulnerabilities with blob verification \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sigstore/cosign \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commit/80b79ed8b4d28ccbce3d279fd273606b5cddcc25", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388 \u00b7 sigstore/cosign@80b79ed \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
