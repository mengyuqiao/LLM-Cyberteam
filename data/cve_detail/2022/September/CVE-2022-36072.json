{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36072", "Description": "SilverwareGames.io is a social network for users to play video games online. In version 1.1.8 and prior, due to an unobvious feature of PHP, hashes generated by built-in functions and starting with the `0e` symbols were being handled as zero multiplied with the `e` number. Therefore, the hash value was equal to 0. The maintainers fixed this in version 1.1.9 by using `===` instead of `==` in comparisons where it is possible (e.g. on sign in/sign up handlers).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36072", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSilverwaregames\u00bbSilverwaregamesVersions  before (<) 1.1.9cpe:2.3:a:silverwaregames:silverwaregames:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-03-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-597 Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/597/Use-of-Wrong-Operator-in-String-Comparison.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mesosoi/silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker/security/advisories/GHSA-w4wq-7j4q-j2fh", "ref_desc": "Should use === for hashing instead of == \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mesosoi/silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
