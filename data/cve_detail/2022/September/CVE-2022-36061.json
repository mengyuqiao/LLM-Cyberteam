{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36061", "Description": "Elrond go is the go implementation for the Elrond Network protocol. In versions prior to 1.3.35, read only calls between contracts can generate smart contracts results. For example, if contract A calls in read only mode contract B and the called function will make changes upon the contract's B state, the state will be altered for contract B as if the call was not made in the read-only mode. This can lead to some effects not designed by the original smart contracts programmers. This issue was patched in version 1.3.35. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36061", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElrond\u00bbElrond GoVersions  before (<) 1.3.35cpe:2.3:a:elrond:elrond_go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.41%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-11-28  0.24%  0.31%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-04-27  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-04-13  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-03-29  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-02-17  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-10-09  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-09-13  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-08-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-665 Improper Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/665/Improper-Initialization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/releases/tag/v1.3.35", "ref_desc": "Release v1.3.35 \u00b7 ElrondNetwork/elrond-go \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/blob/8e402fa6d7e91e779980122d3798b2bf50892945/integrationTests/vm/txsFee/asyncESDT_test.go#L452", "ref_desc": "elrond-go/asyncESDT_test.go at 8e402fa6d7e91e779980122d3798b2bf50892945 \u00b7 ElrondNetwork/elrond-go \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/security/advisories/GHSA-mv8x-668m-53fg", "ref_desc": "Execute on same context checks in VM \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ElrondNetwork/elrond-go \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
