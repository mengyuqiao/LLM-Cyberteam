{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39173", "Description": "In wolfSSL before 5.5.1, malicious clients can cause a buffer overflow during a TLS 1.3 handshake. This occurs when an attacker supposedly resumes a previous TLS session. During the resumption Client Hello a Hello Retry Request must be triggered. Both Client Hellos are required to contain a list of duplicate cipher suites to trigger the buffer overflow. In total, two Client Hellos have to be sent: one in the resumed session, and a second one as a response to a Hello Retry Request message.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39173", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nWolfssl\u00bbWolfsslVersions  before (<) 5.5.1cpe:2.3:a:wolfssl:wolfssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.59%  0.32%  -0.27 \n 2  2024-11-08  0.42%  0.59%  +0.18 \n 3  2024-05-20  0.35%  0.42%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-05-06  0.34%  0.35%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-21  0.37%  0.34%  -0.03 \n 6  2024-03-11  0.31%  0.37%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-01-03  0.26%  0.31%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-10-31  0.19%  0.26%  +0.08 \n 9  2023-10-18  0.13%  0.19%  +0.06 \n 10  2023-10-05  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/24", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: wolfssl before 5.5.1: CVE-2022-39173 Buffer overflow when refining cipher suitesMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/", "ref_desc": "Keeping the wolves out of wolfSSL | Trail of Bits BlogCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NBxrO1la6MO1-jWUgPJafkZDJTM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 wolfSSL/wolfssl \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s42znnNra2f9tQPou2x-HR_oEiU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "wolfSSL Security Vulnerabilities | wolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS LibraryVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xinqaZrISYAhowaQMjvidDuik6I.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/169600/wolfSSL-Buffer-Overflow.html", "ref_desc": "wolfSSL Buffer Overflow \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
