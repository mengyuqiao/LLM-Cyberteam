{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36093", "Description": "XWiki Platform Web Templates are templates for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. By passing a template of the distribution wizard to the xpart template, user accounts can be created even when user registration is disabled. This also circumvents any email verification. Before versions 14.2 and 13.10.4, this can also be exploited on a private wiki, thus potentially giving the attacker access to the wiki. Depending on the configured default rights of users, this could also give attackers write access to an otherwise read-only public wiki. Users can also be created when an external authentication system like LDAP is configured, but authentication fails unless the authentication system supports a bypass/local accounts are enabled in addition to the external authentication system. This issue has been patched in XWiki 13.10.5 and 14.3RC1. As a workaround, one may replace `xpart.vm`, the entry point for this attack, by a patched version from the patch without updating XWiki.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36093", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 8.0andbefore (<) 13.10.5cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.3cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-31  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-09-15  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-09  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/288/Authentication-Bypass-Using-an-Alternate-Path-or-Channel.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-h5j3-5x63-p8jv", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized User Registration Through the Distribution Wizard in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19558", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19558] Users can be created without validation even when registration is disabled - XWiki.org JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/70c64c23f4404f33289458df2a08f7c4be022755", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19558: Only load vm templates in xpart.vm \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@70c64c2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
