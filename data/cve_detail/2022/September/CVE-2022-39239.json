{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39239", "Description": "netlify-ipx is an on-Demand image optimization for Netlify using ipx. In versions prior to 1.2.3, an attacker can bypass the source image domain allowlist by sending specially crafted headers, causing the handler to load and return arbitrary images. Because the response is cached globally, this image will then be served to visitors without requiring those headers to be set. XSS can be achieved by requesting a malicious SVG with embedded scripts, which would then be served from the site domain. Note that this does not apply to images loaded in `<img>` tags, as scripts do not execute in this context. The image URL can be set in the header independently of the request URL, meaning any site images that have not previously been cached can have their cache poisoned. This problem has been fixed in version 1.2.3. As a workaround, cached content can be cleared by re-deploying the site.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39239", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNuxtjs\u00bbNetlify-ipx\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.2.3cpe:2.3:a:nuxtjs:netlify-ipx:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-04-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/netlify/netlify-ipx/security/advisories/GHSA-9jjv-524m-jm98", "ref_desc": "Full Response SSRF and Stored XSS via Cache Poisoning and Improper Host Validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 netlify/netlify-ipx \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
