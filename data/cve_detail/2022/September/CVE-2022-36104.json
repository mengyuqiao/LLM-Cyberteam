{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36104", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. In affected versions requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler which again could retrieve content to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 version 11.5.16 to resolve this issue. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36104", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.4.0andup to, including, (<=) 11.5.15cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-04  0.12%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-04-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-05  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-02-24  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-16  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-09-20  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-08-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-fffr-7x4x-f98q", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service in Page Error Handling \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-006", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-006: Denial of Service in Page Error HandlingVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/179dd7cd78947081d573fee2050e197faa556f13", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Mitigate denial-of-service scenarios in page error handler \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3@179dd7c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
