{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36062", "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions prior to 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6, Grafana is subject to Improper Preservation of Permissions resulting in privilege escalation on some folders where Admin is the only used permission. The vulnerability impacts Grafana instances where RBAC was disabled and enabled afterwards, as the migrations which are translating legacy folder permissions to RBAC permissions do not account for the scenario where the only user permission in the folder is Admin, as a result RBAC adds permissions for Editors and Viewers which allow them to edit and view folders accordingly. This issue has been patched in versions 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6. A workaround when the impacted folder/dashboard is known is to remove the additional permissions manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36062", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  before (<) 8.5.13cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.0andbefore (<) 9.1.6cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.0.9cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-04-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-29  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-p978-56hq-r492", "ref_desc": "Grafana folders admin only permission privilege escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221215-0001/", "ref_desc": "September 2022 Grafana Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tqv2uyizG_VOSXmaPxis5oxuTM0.html"}]}
