{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35951", "Description": "Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow. Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. This has been patched in Redis version 7.0.5. No known workarounds exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35951", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedis\u00bbRedisVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.5cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.86%  4.56%  +1.70 \n 2  2024-05-14  1.72%  2.86%  +1.14 \n 3  2024-04-30  1.46%  1.72%  +0.26 \n 4  2024-04-15  1.16%  1.46%  +0.30 \n 5  2024-03-05  1.18%  1.16%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-12-16  1.11%  1.18%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-11-08  0.71%  1.11%  +0.41 \n 8  2023-10-26  0.62%  0.71%  +0.09 \n 9  2023-10-01  0.39%  0.62%  +0.23 \n 10  2023-08-24  0.33%  0.39%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-03-07  5.63%  0.33%  -5.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-17", "ref_desc": "Redis: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202209-17) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bIbA8m--KGk4ET4x30HXbxz-6B0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221020-0005/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-35951 Redis Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-5gc4-76rx-22c9", "ref_desc": "Heap overflow in Redis 7.0 XAUTOCLAIM command's COUNT argument. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 redis/redis \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A7INCOOFPPEAKNDBZU3TIZJPYXBULI2C/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: redis-7.0.5-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
