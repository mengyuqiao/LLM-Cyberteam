{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-37767", "Description": "Pebble Templates 3.1.5 allows attackers to bypass a protection mechanism and implement arbitrary code execution with springbok. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because input to the Pebble templating engine is intended to include arbitrary Java code, and thus either the input should not arrive from an untrusted source, or else the application using the engine should apply restrictions to the input. The engine is not responsible for validating the input.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37767", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPebbletemplates\u00bbPebble Templates\u00bbVersion:3.1.5cpe:2.3:a:pebbletemplates:pebble_templates:3.1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.46%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-04-04  0.33%  0.33%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-23  0.30%  0.33%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-15  0.28%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-19  0.20%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-08-13  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.18%  -1.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/625#issuecomment-1282138635", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability CVE-2022-37767 \u00b7 Issue #625 \u00b7 PebbleTemplates/pebble \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Y4tacker/Web-Security/issues/3", "ref_desc": "command execution vulnerability in pebble 3.1.5(latest) \u00b7 Issue #3 \u00b7 Y4tacker/Web-Security \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
