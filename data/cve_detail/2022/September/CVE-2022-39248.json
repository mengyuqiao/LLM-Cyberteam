{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39248", "Description": "matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2 would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device key, spilling trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-android-sdk2 version 1.5.1 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop signing backups on a successful decryption. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39248", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSoftware Development Kit\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 1.5.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-20  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2024-03-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-322 Key Exchange without Entity Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/322/Key-Exchange-without-Entity-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/releases/tag/v1.5.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.5.1 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1BjWqwgE2BOH5bd9YtAVWQJnDWs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/security/advisories/GHSA-fpgf-pjjv-2qgm", "ref_desc": "Olm/Megolm protocol confusion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients", "ref_desc": "Upgrade now to address E2EE vulnerabilities in matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2 | Matrix.orgVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/M0cEKVJibKxbSiyBnfkDcFWKlmo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/commit/77df720a238d17308deab83ecaa37f7a4740a17e", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'release/1.5.1' into develop \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2@77df720 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sfttE156uF4Cx2LU02RQ7ZP3tpU.html"}]}
