{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36086", "Description": "linked_list_allocator is an allocator usable for no_std systems. Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36086", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nRust-osdev\u00bbLinked-list-allocator\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.10.2cpe:2.3:a:rust-osdev:linked-list-allocator:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-30  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-18  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-10  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-14  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-08-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/security/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bound writes possible on `Heap` initialization and `Heap::extend` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/013b0758643943e8df5b17bbb495460ff47e8bbf", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j \u00b7 rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator@013b075 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
