{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36100", "Description": "XWiki Platform Applications Tag and XWiki Platform Tag UI are tag applications for XWiki, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 1.7 in XWiki Platform Applications Tag and prior to 13.10.6 and 14.4 in XWiki Platform Tag UI, the tags document `Main.Tags` in XWiki didn't sanitize user inputs properly. This allowed users with view rights on the document (default in a public wiki or for authenticated users on private wikis) to execute arbitrary Groovy, Python and Velocity code with programming rights. This also allowed bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content stored in the XWiki installation. The vulnerability could be used to impact the availability of the wiki. On XWiki versions before 13.10.4 and 14.2, this can be combined with CVE-2022-36092, meaning that no rights are required to perform the attack. The vulnerability has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, the patch that fixes the issue can be manually applied to the document `Main.Tags` or the updated version of that document can be imported from version 14.4 of xwiki-platform-tag-ui using the import feature in the administration UI on XWiki 10.9 and later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36100", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 1.7andbefore (<) 13.10.6cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.4cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.32%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-04-29  0.28%  0.36%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-04-15  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-03-31  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-19  0.22%  0.22%  0.00 \n 6  2023-09-15  0.12%  0.22%  +0.10 \n 7  2023-08-09  0.08%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-07-16  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-95 Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/95/Improper-Neutralization-of-Directives-in-Dynamically-Evaluat.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/604868033ebd191cf2d1e94db336f0c4d9096427", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19747: Escape tag names \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@6048680 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-2g5c-228j-p52x", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') in xwiki-platform-tag-ui \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QDVYkJhX2kwfUkWa-4QLLr7pPaA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19747", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19747] Privilege escalation (PR) with view rights on Main.Tags - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
