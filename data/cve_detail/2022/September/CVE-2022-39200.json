{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39200", "Description": "Dendrite is a Matrix homeserver written in Go. In affected versions events retrieved from a remote homeserver using the `/get_missing_events` path did not have their signatures verified correctly. This could potentially allow a remote homeserver to provide invalid/modified events to Dendrite via this endpoint. Note that this does not apply to events retrieved through other endpoints (e.g. `/event`, `/state`) as they have been correctly verified. Homeservers that have federation disabled are not vulnerable. The problem has been fixed in Dendrite 0.9.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39200", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbDendriteVersions  before (<) 0.9.8cpe:2.3:a:matrix:dendrite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-04  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-23  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-13  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/security/advisories/GHSA-pfw4-xjgm-267c", "ref_desc": "Signature checks not applied to some retrieved missing events \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/dendrite \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/commit/2792d0490f3771488bad346981b8c26479a872c3", "ref_desc": "Fix missing signature check on the `/get_missing_events` response \u00b7 matrix-org/dendrite@2792d04 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
