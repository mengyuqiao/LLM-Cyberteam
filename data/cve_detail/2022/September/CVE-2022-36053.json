{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36053", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. The low-power IPv6 network stack of Contiki-NG has a buffer module (os/net/ipv6/uipbuf.c) that processes IPv6 extension headers in incoming data packets. As part of this processing, the function uipbuf_get_next_header casts a pointer to a uip_ext_hdr structure into the packet buffer at different offsets where extension headers are expected to be found, and then reads from this structure. Because of a lack of bounds checking, the casting can be done so that the structure extends beyond the packet's end. Hence, with a carefully crafted packet, it is possible to cause the Contiki-NG system to read data outside the packet buffer. A patch that fixes the vulnerability is included in Contiki-NG 4.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36053", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  before (<) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-03-24  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-12  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-08  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-08-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1648", "ref_desc": "uipbuf: Do not assume that there is enough space for a following extension header by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #1648 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubBroken LinkCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ObcDJ2nI6mEYgyP_dvhO97MAi5s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-2j9c-7754-w4cw", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read in the uIP buffer module \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
