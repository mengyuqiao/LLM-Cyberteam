{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39255", "Description": "Matrix iOS SDK allows developers to build iOS apps compatible with Matrix. Prior to version 0.23.19, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround. To avoid malicious backup attacks, one should not verify one's new logins using emoji/QR verifications methods until patched.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39255", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSoftware Development Kit\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 0.23.19cpe:2.3:a:matrix:software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-20  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2024-03-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-322 Key Exchange without Entity Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/322/Key-Exchange-without-Entity-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/releases/tag/v0.23.19", "ref_desc": "Release v0.23.19 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hZuFeQWcZy0Jy9qxvOXHRdDWEIw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-hw6g-j8v6-9hcm", "ref_desc": "Olm/Megolm protocol confusion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients", "ref_desc": "Upgrade now to address E2EE vulnerabilities in matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2 | Matrix.orgVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/M0cEKVJibKxbSiyBnfkDcFWKlmo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/commit/5ca86c328a5faaab429c240551cb9ca8f0f6262c", "ref_desc": "Resolve multiple CVEs \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk@5ca86c3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Q9IFvB6Fdp5Qb6rXi7GRw_8W-b0.html"}]}
