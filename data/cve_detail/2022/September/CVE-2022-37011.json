{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-37011", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix SAML (Mendix 7 compatible) (All versions < V1.17.0), Mendix SAML (Mendix 8 compatible) (All versions < V2.3.0), Mendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, New Track) (All versions < V3.3.1), Mendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, Upgrade Track) (All versions < V3.3.0). Affected versions of the module insufficiently protect from packet capture replay. This could allow unauthorized remote attackers to bypass authentication and get access to the application. For compatibility reasons, fix versions still contain this issue, but only when the not recommended, non default configuration option `'Allow Idp Initiated Authentication'` is enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37011", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMendix\u00bbSamlVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.3.1cpe:2.3:a:mendix:saml:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMendix\u00bbSamlVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:mendix:saml:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMendix\u00bbSamlVersions  before (<) 1.17.0cpe:2.3:a:mendix:saml:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.46%  0.29%  -0.17 \n 2  2024-12-05  0.41%  0.46%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-08-28  0.38%  0.41%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-20  0.36%  0.38%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-05  0.31%  0.36%  +0.06 \n 6  2024-02-24  0.28%  0.31%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-09-20  0.17%  0.28%  +0.11 \n 8  2023-08-14  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-638652.pdf", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/K5hEhkYYEhoUs1CXoBsfCRwcBr4.html"}]}
