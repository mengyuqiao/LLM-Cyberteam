{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36109", "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked around by not using the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction. Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` the supplementary groups will be set up properly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36109", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:36cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMobyproject\u00bbMobyVersions  before (<) 20.10.18cpe:2.3:a:mobyproject:moby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-28  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-29  0.17%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-04-01  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-04  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-12-15  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-08  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-09-16  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-08-10  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.06%  -2.14 \n 11  2023-02-23  13.80%  2.20%  -11.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/O7JL2QA3RB732MLJ3RMUXB3IB7AA22YU/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: moby-engine-20.10.18-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-rc4r-wh2q-q6c4", "ref_desc": "Security vulnerability relating to supplementary group permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 moby/moby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cgSk92afq-AtfOLRWBVZxI-MzJ0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v20.10.18", "ref_desc": "Release v20.10.18 \u00b7 moby/moby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/de7af816e76a7fd3fbf06bffa6832959289fba32", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-rc4r-wh2q-q6c4 \u00b7 moby/moby@de7af81 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQQ4E3JBXVR3VK5FIZVJ3QS2TAOOXXTQ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: moby-engine-20.10.18-1.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
