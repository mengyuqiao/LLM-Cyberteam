{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36069", "Description": "Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36069", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPython-poetry\u00bbPoetry\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 1.1.9cpe:2.3:a:python-poetry:poetry:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions\nPython-poetry\u00bbPoetry\u00bbVersion:1.2.0UpdateAlpha1ForPythoncpe:2.3:a:python-poetry:poetry:1.2.0:alpha1:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions\nPython-poetry\u00bbPoetry\u00bbVersion:1.2.0UpdateAlpha2ForPythoncpe:2.3:a:python-poetry:poetry:1.2.0:alpha2:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-28  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.37%  0.04%  -1.32 \n 5  2023-02-23  2.74%  1.37%  -1.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/releases/tag/1.2.0b1", "ref_desc": "Release 1.2.0b1 \u00b7 python-poetry/poetry \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/M4hAjoCpQMl_Y6xrrIZL6LmoGVw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/releases/tag/1.1.9", "ref_desc": "Release 1.1.9 \u00b7 python-poetry/poetry \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VfPgQ3XxdhsNAmZ2_YhNab-YikM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/security/advisories/GHSA-9xgj-fcgf-x6mw", "ref_desc": "Argument Injection can lead to Local Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 python-poetry/poetry \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/securing-developer-tools-package-managers/", "ref_desc": "Securing Developer Tools: Package Managers | SonarCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XPAEBEzu__5g2rgDx1IN0-nAh7s.html"}]}
