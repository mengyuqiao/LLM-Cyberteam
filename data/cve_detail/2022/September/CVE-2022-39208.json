{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39208", "Description": "Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. All files in the /opt/onedev/sites/ directory are exposed and can be read by unauthenticated users. This directory contains all projects, including their bare git repos and build artifacts. This file disclosure vulnerability can be used by unauthenticated attackers to leak all project files of any project. Since project IDs are incremental, an attacker could iterate through them and leak all project data. This issue has been resolved in version 7.3.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39208", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOnedev Project\u00bbOnedevVersions  before (<) 7.3.0cpe:2.3:a:onedev_project:onedev:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.26%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-04-05  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-24  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-16  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-20  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-08-14  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-04  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-29  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.85 \n 10  2023-02-22  12.49%  0.95%  -11.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-h427-rv56-c9h2", "ref_desc": "Git Repository Disclosure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 theonedev/onedev \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/8aa94e0daf8447cdf76d4f27bfda0a85a7ea5822", "ref_desc": "Fix security vulnerability issue regarding site/* access \u00b7 theonedev/onedev@8aa94e0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/onedev-remote-code-execution/", "ref_desc": "Securing Developer Tools: OneDev Remote Code ExecutionExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yYSBMZy8-dsJ-7ufSoouO75RZPU.html"}]}
