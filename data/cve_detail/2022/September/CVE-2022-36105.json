{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36105", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that observing response time during user authentication (backend and frontend) can be used to distinguish between existing and non-existing user accounts. Extension authors of 3rd party TYPO3 extensions providing a custom authentication service should check if the extension is affected by the described problem. Affected extensions must implement new `MimicServiceInterface::mimicAuthUser`, which simulates corresponding times regular processing would usually take. Update to TYPO3 version 7.6.58 ELTS, 8.7.48 ELTS, 9.5.37 ELTS, 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix this problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36105", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.5.36cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.6.57cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.7.47cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 10.4.31cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 11.5.15cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-05  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-24  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-16  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-20  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-08-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/f8b83ce15d4ea275a5a5e564e5d324242f7937b6", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Mitigate timing discrepancies during user authentication \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3@f8b83ce \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-m392-235j-9r7r", "ref_desc": "User Enumeration via Response Timing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-007", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-007: User Enumeration via Response TimingVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
