{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-35931", "Description": "Nextcloud Password Policy is an app that enables a Nextcloud server admin to define certain rules for passwords. Prior to versions 22.2.10, 23.0.7, and 24.0.3 the random password generator may, in very rare cases, generate common passwords that the validator itself would block. Upgrade Nextcloud Server to 22.2.10, 23.0.7 or 24.0.3 to receive a patch for the issue in Password Policy. There are no known workarounds available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35931", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbPassword PolicyVersions  from including (>=) 23.0.0andbefore (<) 23.0.7cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:password_policy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbPassword PolicyVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:password_policy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbPassword PolicyVersions  before (<) 22.2.10cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:password_policy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-29  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-08-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-261 Weak Encoding for Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/261/Weak-Encoding-for-Password.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-c7mw-9q4r-8qwr", "ref_desc": "Generated passwords are not fully validated by HIBPValidator \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/password_policy/pull/363", "ref_desc": "Shuffle before validating by miaulalala \u00b7 Pull Request #363 \u00b7 nextcloud/password_policy \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
