{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39238", "Description": "Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39238", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nArvados\u00bbArvados\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 2.4.3cpe:2.3:a:arvados:arvados:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-15  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-05  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-01  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-08-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/arvados/arvados/security/advisories/GHSA-87jr-xwhg-cxjv", "ref_desc": "Improper Authentication in Arvados when using PAM as identity provider \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 arvados/arvados \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
