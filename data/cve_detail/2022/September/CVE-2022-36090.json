{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36090", "Description": "XWiki Platform Old Core is a core package for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Prior to versions 13.1.0.5 and 14.3-rc-1, some resources are missing a check for inactive (not yet activated or disabled) users in XWiki, including the REST service. This means a disabled user can enable themselves using a REST call. On the same way some resources handler created by extensions are not protected by default, so an inactive user could perform actions for such extensions. This issue has existed since at least version 1.1 of XWiki for instance configured with the email activation required for new users. Now it's more critical for versions 11.3-rc-1 and later since the maintainers provided the capability to disable user without deleting them and encouraged using that feature. XWiki 14.3-rc-1 and XWiki 13.10.5 contain a patch. There is no workaround for this other than upgrading XWiki.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36090", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 1.1andbefore (<) 13.10.5cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.22%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-11-30  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-31  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-15  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-09  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-jgc8-gvcx-9vfx", "ref_desc": "Improper Authorization check for inactive users in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e074d226d9b2b96a0a1ba4349d1b73a802842986", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19559: Refactor handling of users in oldcore \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@e074d22 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19559", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19559] The fact that a user is inactive is far from being taken into account everywhere - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
