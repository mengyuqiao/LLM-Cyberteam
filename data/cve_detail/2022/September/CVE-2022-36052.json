{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36052", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. The 6LoWPAN implementation in Contiki-NG may cast a UDP header structure at a certain offset in a packet buffer. The code does not check whether the packet buffer is large enough to fit a full UDP header structure from the offset where the casting is made. Hence, it is possible to cause an out-of-bounds read beyond the packet buffer. The problem affects anyone running devices with Contiki-NG versions previous to 4.8, and which may receive 6LoWPAN packets from external parties. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG version 4.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36052", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  before (<) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-12  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-08  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-vwr8-6mqv-x7f5", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read when decompressing UDP header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1648", "ref_desc": "uipbuf: Do not assume that there is enough space for a following extension header by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #1648 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ObcDJ2nI6mEYgyP_dvhO97MAi5s.html"}]}
