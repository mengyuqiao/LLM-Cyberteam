{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39215", "Description": "Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked. The issue has been resolved in version 1.0.6 and the implementation now properly checks if the requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39215", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nTauri\u00bbTauriVersions  before (<) 1.0.6cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-12-07  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-07  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-26  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-22  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 \n 8  2023-02-23  7.18%  1.02%  -6.16 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123/commits/1f9b9e8d26a2c915390323e161020bcb36d44678", "ref_desc": "fix(endpoints/fs/readDir): don't read symlinks that are not allowed b\u2026 by amrbashir \u00b7 Pull Request #5123 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123", "ref_desc": "fix(endpoints/fs/readDir): don't read symlinks that are not allowed b\u2026 by amrbashir \u00b7 Pull Request #5123 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-28m8-9j7v-x499", "ref_desc": "The readDir Endpoint Scope can be Bypassed With Symbolic Links \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4882", "ref_desc": "[bug] Accessing junction folder from within $APP folder on Windows \u00b7 Issue #4882 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
