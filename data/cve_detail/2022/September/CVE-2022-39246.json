{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39246", "Description": "matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the key forwarding strategy implemented in the matrix-android-sdk2 that is too permissive. Starting with version 1.5.1, the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-android-sdk2. The matrix-android-sdk2 will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages). As a workaroubnd, current users of the SDK can disable key forwarding in their forks using `CryptoService#enableKeyGossiping(enable: Boolean)`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39246", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSoftware Development Kit\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 1.5.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-20  0.11%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-03-10  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-29  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-322 Key Exchange without Entity Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/322/Key-Exchange-without-Entity-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/releases/tag/v1.5.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.5.1 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1BjWqwgE2BOH5bd9YtAVWQJnDWs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/security/advisories/GHSA-2pvj-p485-cp3m", "ref_desc": "Impersonation via forwarded Megolm sessions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2 \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/commit/77df720a238d17308deab83ecaa37f7a4740a17e", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'release/1.5.1' into develop \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2@77df720 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sfttE156uF4Cx2LU02RQ7ZP3tpU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3061", "ref_desc": "MSC3061: Sharing room keys for past messages by uhoreg \u00b7 Pull Request #3061 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WW6JrOLXhHEDyGU6Tt0G99RbMO4.html"}]}
