{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36076", "Description": "NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36076", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNodebb\u00bbNodebbVersions  before (<) 1.17.2cpe:2.3:a:nodebb:nodebb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-23  0.14%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-09  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-03-25  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-13  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 6  2023-09-09  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-08-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-xmgg-fx9p-prq6", "ref_desc": "Account takeover via SSO plugins (via shared link to /auth/callback with valid code) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blogs.opera.com/security/2022/03/bug-bounty-adventures-a-nodebb-0-day/", "ref_desc": "Bug Bounty Adventures: A NodeBB 0-day - Blog | Opera SecurityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4", "ref_desc": "fix: accidental unnecessarily strict conditional that effectively ren\u2026 \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB@a2400f6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
