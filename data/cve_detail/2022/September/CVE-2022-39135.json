{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39135", "Description": "Apache Calcite 1.22.0 introduced the SQL operators EXISTS_NODE, EXTRACT_XML, XML_TRANSFORM and EXTRACT_VALUE do not restrict XML External Entity references in their configuration, making them vulnerable to a potential XML External Entity (XXE) attack. Therefore any client exposing these operators, typically by using Oracle dialect (the first three) or MySQL dialect (the last one), is affected by this vulnerability (the extent of it will depend on the user under which the application is running). From Apache Calcite 1.32.0 onwards, Document Type Declarations and XML External Entity resolution are disabled on the impacted operators.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39135", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCalciteVersions  from including (>=) 1.22.0andbefore (<) 1.32.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:calcite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.34%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-09-07  0.22%  0.20%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-08-26  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-03  0.28%  0.20%  -0.08 \n 5  2024-02-22  0.38%  0.28%  -0.09 \n 6  2023-10-15  0.36%  0.38%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-10-01  0.36%  0.36%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-09-18  0.32%  0.36%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.32%  -0.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/ohdnhlgm6jvt3srw8l7spkm2d5vwm082", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-39135: Apache Calcite: potential XEE attacks-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/21/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Apache Solr is vulnerable to CVE-2022-39135 via /sql handlerMailing List;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
