{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36097", "Description": "XWiki Platform Attachment UI provides a macro to easily upload and select attachments for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 14.0-rc-1 and prior to 14.4-rc-1, it's possible to store JavaScript in an attachment name, which will be executed by anyone trying to move the corresponding attachment. This issue has been patched in XWiki 14.4-rc-1. As a workaround, one may copy `moveStep1.vm` to `webapp/xwiki/templates/moveStep1.vm` and replace vulnerable code with code from the patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36097", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.3cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.32%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-31  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-03-18  0.32%  0.26%  -0.06 \n 4  2024-02-19  0.37%  0.32%  -0.06 \n 5  2023-10-11  0.41%  0.37%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-09-15  0.84%  0.41%  -0.43 \n 7  2023-08-09  0.74%  0.84%  +0.11 \n 8  2023-05-21  0.52%  0.74%  +0.22 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.52%  -0.50 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/xwiki-platform-14.0-rc-1/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-attachment/xwiki-platform-attachment-api/src/main/resources/templates/attachment/moveStep1.vm", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19667", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19667] The move attachment form is missing escaping and some translations - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/fbc4bfbae4f6ce8109addb281de86a03acdb9277", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19667: The move attachment form is missing escaping and some tr\u2026 \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@fbc4bfb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-9r9j-57rf-f6vj", "ref_desc": "XSS in the move attachment form \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
