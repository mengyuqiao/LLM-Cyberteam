{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-39217", "Description": "some-natalie/ghas-to-csv (GitHub Advanced Security to CSV) is a GitHub action which scrapes the GitHub Advanced Security API and shoves it into a CSV. In affected versions this GitHub Action creates a CSV file without sanitizing the output of the APIs. If an alert is dismissed or any other custom field contains executable code / formulas, it might be run when an endpoint opens that CSV file in a spreadsheet program. This issue has been addressed in version `v1`. Users are advised to use `v1` or later. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39217", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGhas-to-csv Project\u00bbGhas-to-csvVersions  before (<) 1cpe:2.3:a:ghas-to-csv_project:ghas-to-csv:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-08  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-27  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-10-19  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-23  0.10%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-08-17  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 \n 7  2023-02-23  9.03%  0.89%  -8.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/some-natalie/ghas-to-csv/security/advisories/GHSA-634p-93h9-92vh", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File in ghas-to-csv \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 some-natalie/ghas-to-csv \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/some-natalie/ghas-to-csv/commit/d0b521928fa734513b5cd9c7d9d8e09db50e884a", "ref_desc": "move from `csv` to `defusedcsv` (#20) \u00b7 some-natalie/ghas-to-csv@d0b5219 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
