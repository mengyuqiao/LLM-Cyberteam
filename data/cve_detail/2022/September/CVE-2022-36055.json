{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36055", "Description": "Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Fuzz testing, provided by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the _strvals_ package that can cause an out of memory panic. The _strvals_ package contains a parser that turns strings in to Go structures. The _strvals_ package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory panic. Applications that use the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from. The Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client. This issue has been resolved in 3.9.4. SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36055", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nHelm\u00bbHelmVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.9.4cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-24  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-09-08  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-08-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.9.4", "ref_desc": "Release Helm 3.9.4 \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh", "ref_desc": "Denial of service through string value parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ReuvvxshX5CZ9myPJl9T5KTx8sU.html"}]}
