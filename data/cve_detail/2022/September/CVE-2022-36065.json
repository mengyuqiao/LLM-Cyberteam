{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36065", "Description": "GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36065", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGrowthbook\u00bbGrowthbookVersions  before (<) 1.6.0cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-05-26  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-03-29  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-17  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-13  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-08-07  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.06%  -2.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-24 Path Traversal: '../filedir'", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/24/Path-Traversal-..-filedir-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/security/advisories/GHSA-j24q-55xh-wm4r", "ref_desc": "Account creation and file upload vulnerability in self-hosted GrowthBook \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 growthbook/growthbook \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/pull/487", "ref_desc": "Secure file uploads when NODE_ENV=dev by jdorn \u00b7 Pull Request #487 \u00b7 growthbook/growthbook \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/commit/1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264", "ref_desc": "Secure file uploads when NODE_ENV=dev (#487) \u00b7 growthbook/growthbook@1a5edff \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
