{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36436", "Description": "OSU Open Source Lab VNCAuthProxy through 1.1.1 is affected by an vncap/vnc/protocol.py VNCServerAuthenticator authentication-bypass vulnerability that could allow a malicious actor to gain unauthorized access to a VNC session or to disconnect a legitimate user from a VNC session. A remote attacker with network access to the proxy server could leverage this vulnerability to connect to VNC servers protected by the proxy server without providing any authentication credentials. Exploitation of this issue requires that the proxy server is currently accepting connections for the target VNC server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36436", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nOsuosl\u00bbTwisted Vnc Authentication ProxyVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:osuosl:twisted_vnc_authentication_proxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.84%  1.18%  +0.33 \n 2  2024-12-06  0.70%  0.84%  +0.14 \n 3  2024-05-05  0.59%  0.70%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-04-21  0.48%  0.59%  +0.11 \n 5  2024-04-06  0.49%  0.48%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-02-25  0.45%  0.49%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-02-14  0.48%  0.45%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-10-16  0.42%  0.48%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-09-20  0.26%  0.42%  +0.17 \n 10  2023-08-14  0.23%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.21%  0.23%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/VNCAuthProxy/", "ref_desc": "VNCAuthProxy \u00b7 PyPIProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osuosl/twisted_vncauthproxy/tree/release/1.1.1", "ref_desc": "GitHub - osuosl/twisted_vncauthproxy at release/1.1.1Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/cve-2022-36436-twisted-vnc-authentication-proxy-authentication-bypass/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-36436: Twisted VNC Authentication Proxy authentication bypass | GRNET CERTExploit;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osuosl/twisted_vncauthproxy/commit/edc149af29242178091b2d6fcd42c3ef0851644b", "ref_desc": "Fix CVE-2022-36436 - Authentication bypass in RFB security handshake \u2026 \u00b7 osuosl/twisted_vncauthproxy@edc149a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
