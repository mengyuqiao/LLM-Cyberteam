{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-40246", "Description": "A potential attacker can write one byte by arbitrary address at the time of the PEI phase (only during S3 resume boot mode) and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can lead to the mitigations bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM memory. This issue affects: Module name: SbPei SHA256: d827182e5f9b7a9ff0b9d3e232f7cfac43b5237e2681e11f005be627a49283a9 Module GUID: c1fbd624-27ea-40d1-aa48-94c3dc5c7e0d", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40246", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nIntel\u00bbNuc M15 Laptop Kit Lapbc510 Firmware\u00bbVersion:0072cpe:2.3:o:intel:nuc_m15_laptop_kit_lapbc510_firmware:0072:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Intel\u00bbNuc M15 Laptop Kit Lapbc510\u00bbVersion:N/A\nIntel\u00bbNuc M15 Laptop Kit Lapbc710 Firmware\u00bbVersion:0072cpe:2.3:o:intel:nuc_m15_laptop_kit_lapbc710_firmware:0072:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Intel\u00bbNuc M15 Laptop Kit Lapbc710\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-03  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-123 Write-what-where Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/123/Write-what-where-Condition.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.binarly.io/advisories/BRLY-2022-014", "ref_desc": "[BRLY-2022-014] Arbitrary write vulnerability in PEI module leads to arbitrary code execution during PEI phase.Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ami.com/security-center/", "ref_desc": "AMI Firmware Security TeamVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JwvQW0bVoqCBlkoHzk2RUz31wM0.html"}]}
