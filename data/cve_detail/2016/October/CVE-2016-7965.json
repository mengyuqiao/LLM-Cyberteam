{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-7965", "Description": "DokuWiki 2016-06-26a and older uses $_SERVER[HTTP_HOST] instead of the baseurl setting as part of the password-reset URL. This can lead to phishing attacks. (A remote unauthenticated attacker can change the URL's hostname via the HTTP Host header.) The vulnerability can be triggered only if the Host header is not part of the web server routing process (e.g., if several domains are served by the same web server).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-7965", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nDokuwiki\u00bbDokuwikiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2016-06-26acpe:2.3:a:dokuwiki:dokuwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.39%  +0.12 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.27%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94237", "ref_desc": "DokuWiki CVE-2016-7965 Host Address Spoofing Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/issues/1709", "ref_desc": "Password Reset Address Spoof Vulnerability in DokuWiki \u00b7 Issue #1709 \u00b7 splitbrain/dokuwiki \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
