{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-8332", "Description": "A buffer overflow in OpenJPEG 2.1.1 causes arbitrary code execution when parsing a crafted image. An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the jpeg2000 image file format parser as implemented in the OpenJpeg library. A specially crafted jpeg2000 file can cause an out of bound heap write resulting in heap corruption leading to arbitrary code execution. For a successful attack, the target user needs to open a malicious jpeg2000 file. The jpeg2000 image file format is mostly used for embedding images inside PDF documents and the OpenJpeg library is used by a number of popular PDF renderers making PDF documents a likely attack vector.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8332", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nUclouvain\u00bbOpenjpeg\u00bbVersion:2.1.1cpe:2.3:a:uclouvain:openjpeg:2.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.01%  3.24%  +0.23 \n 2  2024-06-15  2.78%  3.01%  +0.23 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.77%  2.78%  +1.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2020CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/aS9sKtk6QJuUkC-PZDOr0rx3cDo.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0193/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0193 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3768", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3768-1 openjpeg2CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iVp0q7OYoSoxDwYIEVb4HiV8d-g.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93242", "ref_desc": "OpenJPEG CVE-2016-8332 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038623", "ref_desc": "Google Android Multiple Flaws Let Remote Users Deny Service, Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information, and Execute Arbitrary Code and Let Local Apps Gain Elevated Privileges - SecurityTrackerCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oSLaQgtruuG_Teha4uqYk-_UDxI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/releases/tag/v2.1.2", "ref_desc": "Release OpenJPEG 2.1.2 \u00b7 uclouvain/openjpeg \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
