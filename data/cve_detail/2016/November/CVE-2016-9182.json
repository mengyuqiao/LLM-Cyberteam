{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9182", "Description": "Exponent CMS 2.4 uses PHP reflection to call a method of a controller class, and then uses the method name to check user permission. But, the method name in PHP reflection is case insensitive, and Exponent CMS permits undefined actions to execute by default, so an attacker can use a capitalized method name to bypass the permission check, e.g., controller=expHTMLEditor&action=preview&editor=ckeditor and controller=expHTMLEditor&action=Preview&editor=ckeditor. An anonymous user will be rejected for the former but can access the latter.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9182", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nExponentcms\u00bbExponent Cms\u00bbVersion:2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:exponentcms:exponent_cms:2.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/exponentcms/exponent-cms/commit/684d79424f768db8bb345d5c68aa2a886239492b", "ref_desc": "fix security vulnerability to bypass permissions using method name in\u2026 \u00b7 exponentcms/exponent-cms@684d794 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94227", "ref_desc": "Exponent CMS SQL Injection and Security Bypass VulnerabilitiesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jgUiOcmvGi9zV9QRRjcuFhk7vxI.html"}]}
