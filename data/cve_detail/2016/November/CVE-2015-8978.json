{"CVE Code": "CVE-2015-8978", "Description": "In Soap Lite (aka the SOAP::Lite extension for Perl) 1.14 and earlier, an example attack consists of defining 10 or more XML entities, each defined as consisting of 10 of the previous entity, with the document consisting of a single instance of the largest entity, which expands to one billion copies of the first entity. The amount of computer memory used for handling an external SOAP call would likely exceed that available to the process parsing the XML.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-8978", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSoap::lite Project\u00bbSoap::lite\u00bbForPerlVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.14cpe:2.3:a:soap\\:\\:lite_project:soap\\:\\:lite:*:*:*:*:*:perl:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/PHRED/SOAP-Lite-1.20/Changes", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94487", "ref_desc": "Perl Soap Lite Extension CVE-2015-8978 Denial of Service Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
