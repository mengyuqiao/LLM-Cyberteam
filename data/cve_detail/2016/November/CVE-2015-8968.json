{"CVE Code": "CVE-2015-8968", "Description": "git-fastclone before 1.0.1 permits arbitrary shell command execution from .gitmodules. If an attacker can instruct a user to run a recursive clone from a repository they control, they can get a client to run an arbitrary shell command. Alternately, if an attacker can MITM an unencrypted git clone, they could exploit this. The ext command will be run if the repository is recursively cloned or if submodules are updated. This attack works when cloning both local and remote repositories.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-8968", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSquareup\u00bbGit-fastcloneVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:squareup:git-fastclone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.93%  0.52%  -0.41 \n 2  2023-03-07  2.58%  0.93%  -1.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/square/git-fastclone/pull/2", "ref_desc": "Fixes the same issue as CVE-2015-7545. by alokmenghrajani \u00b7 Pull Request #2 \u00b7 square/git-fastclone \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/104465", "ref_desc": "#104465 git-fastclone allows arbitrary command execution through usage of ext remote URLs in submodulesExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/81433", "ref_desc": "Square git-fastclone Multiple Remote Command Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/e-m6yUabUxDBSfOqHWT5fYLXYho.html"}]}
