{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-1421", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web application for Cisco IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software fails to check the bounds of input data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web server of a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1421", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIp Phone 8800 Series Firmware\u00bbVersion:11.0(1)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ip_phone_8800_series_firmware:11.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone", "EPSS Score": "0.94% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.50%  0.94%  -0.56 \n 2  2024-07-10  1.47%  1.50%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  3.80%  1.47%  -2.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160609-ipp", "ref_desc": "Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series Web Application Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2020-24", "ref_desc": "Cisco IP Phones Web Server Multiple Vulnerabilities - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00ae", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160609-ipp", "ref_desc": "Cisco IP Phones Web Application Buffer Overflow Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
