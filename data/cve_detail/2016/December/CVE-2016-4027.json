{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-4027", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev10. App Suite frontend offers to control whether a user wants to store cookies that exceed the session duration. This functionality is useful when logging in from clients with reduced privileges or shared environments. However the setting was incorrectly recognized and cookies were stored regardless of this setting when the login was performed using a non-interactive login method. In case the setting was enforced by middleware configuration or the user went through the interactive login page, the workflow was correct. Cookies with authentication information may become available to other users on shared environments. In case the user did not properly log out from the session, third parties with access to the same client can access a user's account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-4027", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nOpen-xchange\u00bbOpen-xchange Appsuite\u00bbUpdateRev9Versions  up to, including, (<=) 7.8.1cpe:2.3:a:open-xchange:open-xchange_appsuite:*:rev9:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036157", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange App Suite Multiple Bugs Let Remote Users Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information, Conduct Cross-Site Scripting and Server-Side Request Forgery Attacks, Spoof Content, and Deny Service -Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/33shPWW3Y8wyWLf1Ugcf3Tfkn7k.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538732/100/0/threaded", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocusCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fGT7cC-U0Lwvoe1Md6A-MS9JsKo.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/137599/Open-Xchange-App-Suite-7.8.1-Information-Disclosure.html", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange App Suite 7.8.1 Information Disclosure \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
