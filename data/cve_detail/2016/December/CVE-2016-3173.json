{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-3173", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX AppSuite before 7.8.0-rev27. The aria-label parameter of tiles at the Portal can be used to inject script code. Those labels use the name of the file (e.g. an image) which gets displayed at the portal application. Using script code at the file name leads to script execution. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). Users actively need to add a file to the portal to enable this attack. In case of shared files however, a internal attacker may modify a previously embedded file to carry a malicious file name. Furthermore this vulnerability can be used to persistently execute code that got injected by a temporary script execution vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-3173", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpen-xchange\u00bbOpen-xchange Appsuite\u00bbUpdateRev26Versions  up to, including, (<=) 7.8.0cpe:2.3:a:open-xchange:open-xchange_appsuite:*:rev26:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-07-19  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.58%  0.05%  -1.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/137187/Open-Xchange-OX-AppSuite-7.8.0-XSS-Open-Redirect.html", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange OX AppSuite 7.8.0 XSS / Open Redirect \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VHVUBH2NppOoL0D3niS5kYygWIQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538481/100/0/threaded", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocusCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/z9t_HJaBqAmGGly3PhjoeiYFhm4.html"}]}
