{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9037", "Description": "An exploitable out-of-bounds array access vulnerability exists in the xrow_header_decode function of Tarantool 1.7.2.0-g8e92715. A specially crafted packet can cause the function to access an element outside the bounds of a global array that is used to determine the type of the specified key's value. This can lead to an out of bounds read within the context of the server. An attacker who exploits this vulnerability can cause a denial of service vulnerability on the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9037", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nTarantool\u00bbTarantool\u00bbVersion:1.7.2cpe:2.3:a:tarantool:tarantool:1.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.04%  1.55%  -1.50 \n 2  2023-05-08  4.54%  3.04%  -1.49 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  4.54%  +3.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0255/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0255 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95063", "ref_desc": "Tarantool CVE-2016-9037 Denial of Service VulnerabilityBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
