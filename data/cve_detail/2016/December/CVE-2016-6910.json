{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-6910", "Description": "The non-existent notification listener vulnerability was introduced in the initial Android 5.0.2 builds for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge devices, but the vulnerability can persist on the device even after the device has been upgraded to an Android 5.1.1 or 6.0.1 build. The vulnerable system app gives a non-existent app the ability to read the notifications from the device, which a third-party app can utilize if it uses a package name of com.samsung.android.app.portalservicewidget. This vulnerability allows an unprivileged third-party app to obtain the text of the user's notifications, which tend to contain personal data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6910", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:5.1.1cpe:2.3:o:google:android:5.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:6.0.1cpe:2.3:o:google:android:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:5.0.2cpe:2.3:o:google:android:5.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95092", "ref_desc": "Multiple Samsung Galaxy Product Information Disclosure Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.kryptowire.com/disclosures/CVE-2016-6910/Factory_Resets_and_Obtaining_Notifications_on_Samsung_Android_Devices.pdf", "ref_desc": "Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
