{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-5124", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev14. Adding images from external sources to HTML editors by drag&drop can potentially lead to script code execution in the context of the active user. To exploit this, a user needs to be tricked to use an image from a specially crafted website and add it to HTML editor areas of OX App Suite, for example E-Mail Compose or OX Text. This specific attack circumvents typical XSS filters and detection mechanisms since the code is not loaded from an external service but injected locally. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). To exploit this vulnerability, a attacker needs to convince a user to follow specific steps (social-engineering).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5124", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOpen-xchange\u00bbOpen-xchange Appsuite\u00bbUpdateRev12Versions  up to, including, (<=) 7.8.1cpe:2.3:a:open-xchange:open-xchange_appsuite:*:rev12:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.77% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.77%  +0.43 \n 2  2023-03-07  2.58%  0.34%  -2.24 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/91775", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange AppSuite CVE-2016-5124 Multiple Cross Site Scripting VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538892/100/0/threaded", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocus", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/137894/Open-Xchange-App-Suite-7.8.1-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange App Suite 7.8.1 Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036296", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange App Suite Input Validation Flaws Let Remote Conduct Cross-Site Scripting Attacks - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
