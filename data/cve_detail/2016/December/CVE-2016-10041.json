{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10041", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Sprecher Automation SPRECON-E Service Program before 3.43 SP0. Under certain preconditions, it is possible to execute telegram simulation as a non-admin user. As prerequisites, a user must have created an online-connection, validly authenticated and authorized as administrator, and executed telegram simulation. After that, the online-connection must have been closed. Incorrect caching of client data then may lead to privilege escalation, where a subsequently acting non-admin user is permitted to do telegram simulation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a potential attacker would need to have both a valid engineering-account in the SPRECON RBAC system as well as access to a service/maintenance computer with SPRECON-E Service Program running. Additionally, a valid admin-user must have closed the service connection beforehand without closing the program, having executed telegram simulation; the attacker then has access to the running software instance. Hence, there is no risk from external attackers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10041", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSprecher-automation\u00bbSprecon-e Service Program\u00bbVersion:3.42UpdateSP0cpe:2.3:a:sprecher-automation:sprecon-e_service_program:3.42:sp0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.sprecher-automation.com/en/it-security/", "ref_desc": "Sprecher Automation: IT SecurityVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1Gwuv9Bcg6uAXoQ9Smc6fyE1FvE.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95296", "ref_desc": "Sprecher Automation SPRECON-E Service CVE-2016-10041 Privilege Escalation Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
