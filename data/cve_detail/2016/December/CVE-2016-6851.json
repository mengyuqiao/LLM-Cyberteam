{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-6851", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX Guard before 2.4.2-rev5. Script code can be provided as parameter to the OX Guard guest reader web application. This allows cross-site scripting attacks against arbitrary users since no prior authentication is needed. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.) in case the user has an active session on the same domain already.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6851", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOpen-xchange\u00bbOx Guard\u00bbUpdateRev4Versions  up to, including, (<=) 2.4.2cpe:2.3:a:open-xchange:ox_guard:*:rev4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  2.49%  +2.24 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.24%  0.26%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-21  0.34%  0.24%  -0.10 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.34%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92920", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange OX Guard Multiple Cross Site Scripting VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Covzv4UW7eVWl0SLwtXzvBXiDms.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/138701/Open-Xchange-Guard-2.4.2-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange Guard 2.4.2 Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fUN1bMvaZPcWvmEWqSJyv75sLOE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40377/", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange Guard 2.4.2 - Multiple Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilitiesExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/soNe_NtBEdOERSF542SM1DaXE6U.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/539395/100/0/threaded", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocusCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UUuBpXdy2Gzw25qHYLEx9_8OMNk.html"}]}
