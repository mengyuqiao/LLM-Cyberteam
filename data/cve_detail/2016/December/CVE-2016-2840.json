{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-2840", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange Server 6 / OX AppSuite before 7.8.0-rev26. The \"session\" parameter for file-download requests can be used to inject script code that gets reflected through the subsequent status page. Malicious script code can be executed within a trusted domain's context. While no OX App Suite specific data can be manipulated, the vulnerability can be exploited without being authenticated and therefore used for social engineering attacks, stealing cookies or redirecting from trustworthy to malicious hosts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-2840", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOpen-xchange\u00bbOpen-xchange Appsuite\u00bbUpdateRev25Versions  up to, including, (<=) 7.8.0cpe:2.3:a:open-xchange:open-xchange_appsuite:*:rev25:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/537959/100/0/threaded", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocus", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1035469", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange Input Validation Flaws Let Remote Conduct Cross-Site Scripting Attacks - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/136543/Open-Xchange-7.8.0-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "Open-Xchange 7.8.0 Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
