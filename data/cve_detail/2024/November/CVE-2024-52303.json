{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52303", "Description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11, a memory leak can occur when a request produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with aiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52303", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/772/Missing-Release-of-Resource-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-27mf-ghqm-j3j8", "ref_desc": "Memory leak when middlewares are used \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/bc15db61615079d1b6327ba42c682f758fa96936", "ref_desc": "[PR #9852/249855a backport][3.10] Fix system routes polluting the mid\u2026 \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp@bc15db6 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
