{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52799", "Description": "Argo Workflows Chart is used to set up argo and its needed dependencies through one command. Prior to 0.44.0, the workflow-role has excessive privileges, the worst being create pods/exec, which will allow kubectl exec into any Pod in the same namespace, i.e. arbitrary code execution within those Pods. If a user can be made to run a malicious template, their whole namespace can be compromised. This affects versions of the argo-workflows Chart that use appVersion: 3.4 and above, which no longer need these permissions for the only available Executor, Emissary. It could also affect users below 3.4 depending on their choice of Executor in those versions. This only affects the Helm Chart and not the upstream manifests. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.44.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52799", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-250 Execution with Unnecessary Privileges", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/250/Execution-with-Unnecessary-Privileges.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1220 Insufficient Granularity of Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1220/Insufficient-Granularity-of-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/security/advisories/GHSA-fgrf-2886-4q7m", "ref_desc": "confirm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/commit/81dc44c4a5ccd42c799469a78eb96a68048a4987", "ref_desc": "misc", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
