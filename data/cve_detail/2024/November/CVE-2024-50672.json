The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of user input, which is used as a query in Mongoose's find() function. This makes it possible for attackers to perform a full takeover of the administrator account. Attackers can then use the newly gained administrative privileges to upload a custom plugin to perform remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the web application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50672", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring", "ref_desc": "GitHub - adaptlearning/adapt_authoring: A server-based user interface for authoring eLearning courses using the Adapt framework.CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8XbGk4sMKJV7efFEArm-6WRuZPM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dos-m0nk3y/CVE/tree/main/CVE-2024-50672", "ref_desc": "CVE/CVE-2024-50672 at main \u00b7 dos-m0nk3y/CVE \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
