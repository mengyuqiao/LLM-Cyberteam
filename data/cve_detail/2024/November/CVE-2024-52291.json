{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52291", "Description": "Craft is a content management system (CMS). A vulnerability in CraftCMS allows an attacker to bypass local file system validation by utilizing a double file:// scheme (e.g., file://file:////). This enables the attacker to specify sensitive folders as the file system, leading to potential file overwriting through malicious uploads, unauthorized access to sensitive files, and, under certain conditions, remote code execution (RCE) via Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) payloads. Note that this will only work if you have an authenticated administrator account with allowAdminChanges enabled. This is fixed in 5.4.6 and 4.12.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52291", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft CmsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0-RC1andbefore (<) 5.4.6cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft CmsVersions  after (>) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.12.5cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft CmsVersions  after (>) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.4.6cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft CmsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0-RC1andbefore (<) 4.12.5cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft Cms\u00bbVersion:4.0.0UpdateRC3cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:4.0.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft Cms\u00bbVersion:4.0.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:4.0.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft Cms\u00bbVersion:4.0.0UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:4.0.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft Cms\u00bbVersion:5.0.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:5.0.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-jrh5-vhr9-qh7q", "ref_desc": "Local File System Validation Bypass Leading to File Overwrite, Sensitive File Access, and Potential Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 craftcms/cms \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
