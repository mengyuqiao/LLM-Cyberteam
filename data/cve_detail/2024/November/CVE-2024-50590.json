{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50590", "Description": "Attackers with local access to the medical office computer can \nescalate their Windows user privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by \noverwriting one of two Elefant service binaries with weak permissions.\u00a0The default installation directory of Elefant is \"C:\\Elefant1\" which is \nwritable for all users. In addition, the Elefant installer registers two\n Firebird database services which are running as \u201cNT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\u201d.\u00a0\n\nPath: C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbserver.exe\n\nPath: C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbguard.exe\n\n\nBoth service binaries are user writable. This means that a local \nattacker can rename one of the service binaries, replace the service \nexecutable with a new executable, and then restart the system. Once the \nsystem has rebooted, the new service binary is executed as \"NT \nAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\".", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50590", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-250 Execution with Unnecessary Privileges", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/250/Execution-with-Unnecessary-Privileges.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://r.sec-consult.com/hasomed", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities in HASOMED Elefant and Elefant Software Updater - SEC ConsultCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dVnYpjkaVNR5W-GH6_Moh5dWziU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://hasomed.de/produkte/elefant/", "ref_desc": "Elefant\u00ae - Praxissoftware f\u00fcr Psychotherapeut:innen | HASOMED GmbHCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/w2b2OZDjlL1-vaLRjwCcAFuuZD8.html"}]}
