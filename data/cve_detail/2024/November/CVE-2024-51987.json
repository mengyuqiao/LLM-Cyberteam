{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-51987", "Description": "Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect is a set of .NET libraries that manage OAuth and OpenId Connect access tokens. HTTP Clients created by `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` may use a different user's access token after a token refresh occurs. This occurs because a refreshed token will be captured in pooled `HttpClient` instances, which may be used by a different user. Instead of using `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` to create an `HttpClient` that automatically adds a managed token to outgoing requests, you can use the `HttpConext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync` extension method or the `IUserTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync` method. This issue is fixed in Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect 3.0.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51987", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-270 Privilege Context Switching Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/270/Privilege-Context-Switching-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/Duende.AccessTokenManagement/security/advisories/GHSA-7mr7-4f54-vcx5", "ref_desc": "HTTP Client uses incorrect token after refresh \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DuendeSoftware/Duende.AccessTokenManagement \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
