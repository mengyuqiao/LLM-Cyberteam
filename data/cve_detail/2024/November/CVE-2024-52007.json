{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52007", "Description": "HAPI FHIR is a complete implementation of the HL7 FHIR standard for healthcare interoperability in Java. XSLT parsing performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag ( <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM \"/etc/passwd\"> ]> could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. This is related to GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf, in which its fix (#1571 & #1717) was incomplete. This issue has been addressed in release version 6.4.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52007", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#jaxp-documentbuilderfactory-saxparserfactory-and-dom4j", "ref_desc": "XML External Entity Prevention - OWASP Cheat Sheet Series", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/security/advisories/GHSA-gr3c-q7xf-47vh", "ref_desc": "XXE vulnerability in XSLT parsing in `org.hl7.fhir.core` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/issues/1571", "ref_desc": "Insecure Transformer used in XmlParsers \u00b7 Issue #1571 \u00b7 hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/security/advisories/GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf", "ref_desc": "XXE vulnerability in XSLT transforms in `org.hl7.fhir.core` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lcujnGH-mqIiKbitm6H7cZoHdUA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/pull/1717", "ref_desc": "Move all instantiation of transformerFactory to XMLUtils and set ACCESS_EXTERNAL flags automatically by dotasek \u00b7 Pull Request #1717 \u00b7 hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html", "ref_desc": "CWE - CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (4.15)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
