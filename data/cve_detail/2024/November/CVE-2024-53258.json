{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53258", "Description": "Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments. From Autolab versions v.3.0.0 onward students can download all assignments from another student, as long as they are logged in, using the download_all_submissions feature. This can allow for leakage of submissions to unauthorized users, such as downloading submissions from other students in the class, or even instructor test submissions, given they know their user IDs. This issue has been patched in commit `1aa4c769` which is not yet in a release version, but is expected to be included in version 3.0.3. Users are advised to either manually patch or to wait for version 3.0.3. As a workaround administrators can disable the feature.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53258", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-359 Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/359/Exposure-of-Private-Personal-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/commit/1aa4c7690892fb458d2c61ff86739f368e34769d", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 autolab/Autolab@1aa4c76 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-84qc-7773-2gg3", "ref_desc": "download_all_submissions allows student to download another student's submissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 autolab/Autolab \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
