{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50378", "Description": "Airflow versions before 2.10.3 have a vulnerability that allows authenticated users with audit log access to see sensitive values in audit logs which they should not see.\u00a0When sensitive variables were set via airflow CLI, values of those variables appeared in the audit log and were stored unencrypted in the Airflow database. While this risk is limited to users with audit log access, it is recommended to upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3 or a later version, which addresses this issue. Users who previously used the CLI to set secret variables should manually delete entries with those variables from the log table.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50378", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/201/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-Into-Sent-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/17rxys384lzfd6nhm3fztzgvk47zy7jb", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-50378: Apache Airflow: Secrets not masked in UI when sensitive variables are set via Airflow cli-Apache Mail Archives", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43123", "ref_desc": "Better handling masking of values of set variable by shubhamraj-git \u00b7 Pull Request #43123 \u00b7 apache/airflow \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
