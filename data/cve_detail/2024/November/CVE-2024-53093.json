{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53093", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-multipath: defer partition scanning\n\nWe need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the\ncontroller's scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will\nwait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that\naction also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer the\npartion scan to a different context that does not block scan_work.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53093", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/60de2e03f984cfbcdc12fa552f95087c35a05a98", "ref_desc": "nvme-multipath: defer partition scanning - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4a57f42e5ed42cb8f1beb262c4f6d3e698939e4e", "ref_desc": "nvme-multipath: defer partition scanning - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f021341eef41e77a633186e9be5223de2ce5d48", "ref_desc": "nvme-multipath: defer partition scanning - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a91b7eddf45afeeb9c5ece11dddff5de0921b00f", "ref_desc": "nvme-multipath: defer partition scanning - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
