{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52814", "Description": "Argo Helm is a collection of community maintained charts for `argoproj.github.io` projects. Prior to version 0.45.0, the `workflow-role`) lacks granularity in its privileges, giving permissions to `workflowtasksets` and `workflowartifactgctasks` to all workflow Pods, when only certain types of Pods created by the Controller require these privileges. The impact is minimal, as an attack could only affect status reporting for certain types of Pods and templates. Version 0.45.0 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52814", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1220 Insufficient Granularity of Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1220/Insufficient-Granularity-of-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml", "ref_desc": "argo-helm/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml at 2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc \u00b7 argoproj/argo-helm \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml#L45-L56", "ref_desc": "argo-helm/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml at 2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc \u00b7 argoproj/argo-helm \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5/manifests/quick-start/base/artifactgc-role.yaml", "ref_desc": "argo-workflows/manifests/quick-start/base/artifactgc-role.yaml at 5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-workflows \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/security/advisories/GHSA-h974-w8pg-cx73", "ref_desc": "Workflows: Lack of Granularity in Workflow Role \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-helm \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5/manifests/quick-start/base/agent-role.yaml", "ref_desc": "argo-workflows/manifests/quick-start/base/agent-role.yaml at 5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5 \u00b7 argoproj/argo-workflows \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
