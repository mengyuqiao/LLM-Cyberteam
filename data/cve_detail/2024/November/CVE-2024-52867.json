The vulnerability can be remediated within the product via certain pull, reconfigure, and restart actions. Both 5ab3c4c and 5582241 are needed to resolve the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52867", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=5ab3c4c1e43ebb637551223791db0ea3519986e1", "ref_desc": "daemon: Sanitize successful build outputs prior to exposing them. - guix.git - GNU Guix and GNU Guix System", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=558224140dab669cabdaebabff18504a066c48d4", "ref_desc": "daemon: Sanitize failed build outputs prior to exposing them. - guix.git - GNU Guix and GNU Guix System", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2024/build-user-takeover-vulnerability/", "ref_desc": "Build User Takeover Vulnerability \u2014 2024 \u2014 Blog \u2014 GNU\u00a0Guix", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
