{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50357", "Description": "FutureNet NXR series routers provided by Century Systems Co., Ltd. have REST-APIs, which are configured as disabled in the initial (factory default) configuration. But, REST-APIs are unexpectedly enabled when the affected product is powered up, provided either http-server (GUI) or Web authentication is enabled. The factory default configuration makes http-server (GUI) enabled, which means REST-APIs are also enabled. The username and the password for REST-APIs are configured in the factory default configuration. As a result, an attacker may obtain and/or alter the affected product's settings via REST-APIs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50357", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-684 Incorrect Provision of Specified Functionality", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/684/Incorrect-Provision-of-Specified-Functionality.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jvn.jp/en/vu/JVNVU95001899/", "ref_desc": "JVNVU#95001899: REST-APIs unintentionally enabled in Century Systems FutureNet NXR series routers", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.centurysys.co.jp/backnumber/nxr_common/20241031-01.html", "ref_desc": "\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b | CENTURY SYSTEMS", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
