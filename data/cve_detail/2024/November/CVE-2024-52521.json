{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52521", "Description": "Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. MD5 hashes were used to check background jobs for their uniqueness. This increased the chances of a background job with arguments falsely being identified as already existing and not be queued for execution. By changing the Hash to SHA256 the probability was heavily decreased. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.10, 29.0.7 or 30.0.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52521", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-328 Use of Weak Hash", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/328/Use-of-Weak-Hash.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-2q6f-gjgj-7hp4", "ref_desc": "Potential hash collision for background jobs could skip queuing them \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/47769", "ref_desc": "fix: Use sha256 to hash arguments of background jobs by artonge \u00b7 Pull Request #47769 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/commit/a933ba1fdba77e7d8c6b8ff400e082cf853ea46d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #47769 from nextcloud/artonge/fix/use_sha256_for_a\u2026 \u00b7 nextcloud/server@a933ba1 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
