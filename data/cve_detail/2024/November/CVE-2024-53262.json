{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53262", "Description": "SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. The static error.html template for errors contains placeholders that are replaced without escaping the content first. error.html is the page that is rendered when everything else fails. It can contain the following placeholders: %sveltekit.status% \u2014 the HTTP status, and %sveltekit.error.message% \u2014 the error message.  This leads to possible injection if an app explicitly creates an error with a message that contains user controlled content. Only applications where user provided input is used in the `Error` message will be vulnerable, so the vast majority of applications will not be vulnerable This issue has been addressed in version 2.8.3 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53262", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/security/advisories/GHSA-mh2x-fcqh-fmqv", "ref_desc": "Unescaped error message included on error page \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sveltejs/kit \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/errors", "ref_desc": "Errors \u2022 Docs \u2022 Svelte", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/commit/134e36343ef57ed7e6e2b3bb9e7f05ad37865794", "ref_desc": "fix: ensure error messages are escaped (#13050) \u00b7 sveltejs/kit@134e363 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
