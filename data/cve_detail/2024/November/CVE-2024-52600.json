{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52600", "Description": "Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Prior to version 5.17.0, assets uploaded with appropriately crafted filenames may result in them being placed in a location different than what was configured. The issue affects front-end forms with `assets` fields and other places where assets can be uploaded, although users would need upload permissions anyway. Files can be uploaded so they would be located on the server in a different location, and potentially override existing files. Traversal outside an asset container is not possible. This path traversal vulnerability has been fixed in 5.17.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52600", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/4cc2c9bd0f39a93b3fc7e9ef0f12792576fd380d", "ref_desc": "[5.x] Prevent asset folder path traversal (#11136) \u00b7 statamic/cms@4cc2c9b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/400875b20f40e1343699d536a432a6fc284346da", "ref_desc": "[5.x] More path traversal fixes (#11140) \u00b7 statamic/cms@400875b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/0c07c10009a2439c8ee56c8faefd1319dc6e388d", "ref_desc": "[5.x] Add upload path traversal tests (#11139) \u00b7 statamic/cms@0c07c10 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-p7f6-8mcm-fwv3", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal in Asset Upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 statamic/cms \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
