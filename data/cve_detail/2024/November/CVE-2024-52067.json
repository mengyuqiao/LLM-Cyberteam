{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52067", "Description": "Apache NiFi 1.16.0 through 1.28.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M4 include optional debug logging of Parameter Context values during the flow synchronization process. An authorized administrator with access to change logging levels could enable debug logging for framework flow synchronization, causing the application to write Parameter names and values to the application log. Parameter Context values may contain sensitive information depending on application flow configuration. Deployments of Apache NiFi with the default Logback configuration do not log Parameter Context values. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.0.0 or 1.28.1 is the recommendation mitigation, eliminating Parameter value logging from the flow synchronization process regardless of the Logback configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52067", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/9rz5rwn2zc7pfjq7ppqldqlc067tlcwd", "ref_desc": "vendor advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
