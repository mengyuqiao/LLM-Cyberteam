{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50294", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls\n\nIf a call gets aborted (e.g. because kafs saw a signal) between it being\nqueued for connection and the I/O thread picking up the call, the abort\nwill be prioritised over the connection and it will be removed from\nlocal->new_client_calls by rxrpc_disconnect_client_call() without a lock\nbeing held.  This may cause other calls on the list to disappear if a race\noccurs.\n\nFix this by taking the client_call_lock when removing a call from whatever\nlist its ->wait_link happens to be on.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50294", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b1fdb0bb3b6513f5bd26f92369fd6ac1a2422d8b", "ref_desc": "rxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fc9de52de38f656399d2ce40f7349a6b5f86e787", "ref_desc": "rxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/996a7208dadbf2cdda8d51444d5ee1fdd1ccbc92", "ref_desc": "rxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
