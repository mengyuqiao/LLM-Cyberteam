{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53861", "Description": "pyjwt is a JSON Web Token implementation in Python. An incorrect string comparison is run for `iss` checking, resulting in `\"acb\"` being accepted for `\"_abc_\"`. This is a bug introduced in version 2.10.0: checking the \"iss\" claim changed from `isinstance(issuer, list)` to `isinstance(issuer, Sequence)`. Since str is a Sequnce, but not a list, `in` is also used for string comparison. This results in `if \"abc\" not in \"__abcd__\":` being checked instead of `if \"abc\" != \"__abc__\":`. Signature checks are still present so real world impact is likely limited to denial of service scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 2.10.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53861", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/697/Incorrect-Comparison.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/security/advisories/GHSA-75c5-xw7c-p5pm", "ref_desc": "Issuer field partial matches allowed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jpadilla/pyjwt \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/commit/33022c25525c1020869c71ce2a4109e44ae4ced1", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 jpadilla/pyjwt@33022c2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/commit/1570e708672aa9036bc772476beae8bfa48f4131#diff-6893ad4a1c5a36b8af3028db8c8bc3b62418149843fc382faf901eaab008e380R366", "ref_desc": "chore: use sequence for typing rather than list (#970) \u00b7 jpadilla/pyjwt@1570e70 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
