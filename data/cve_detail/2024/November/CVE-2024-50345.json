{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50345", "Description": "symfony/http-foundation is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification. The `Request` class, does not parse URI with special characters the same way browsers do. As a result, an attacker can trick a validator relying on the `Request` class to redirect users to another domain. The `Request::create` methods now assert the URI does not contain invalid characters as defined by https://url.spec.whatwg.org/. This issue has been patched in versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50345", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-mrqx-rp3w-jpjp", "ref_desc": "Open redirect via browser-sanitized URLs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://url.spec.whatwg.org", "ref_desc": "URL Standard", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
