{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53260", "Description": "Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments. A user can modify their first and or last name to include a valid excel / spreadsheet formula. When an instructor downloads their course's roster and opens, this name will then be evaluated as a formula. This could lead to leakage of information of students in the course roster by sending the data to a remote endpoint. This issue has been patched in the source code repository and the fix is expected to be released in the next version. Users are advised to manually patch their systems or to wait for the next release. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53260", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1236 Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1236/Improper-Neutralization-of-Formula-Elements-in-a-CSV-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/commit/fe44b53815d37c63e751032205b692ccd5737620", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 autolab/Autolab@fe44b53 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-cqxx-pfmh-h43g", "ref_desc": "Course Roster vulnerable to CSV Injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 autolab/Autolab \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
