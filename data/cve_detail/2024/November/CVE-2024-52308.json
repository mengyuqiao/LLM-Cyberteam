{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52308", "Description": "The GitHub CLI version 2.6.1 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution through a malicious codespace SSH server when using `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands. This has been patched in the cli v2.62.0.\n\nDevelopers connect to remote codespaces through an SSH server running within the devcontainer, which is generally provided through the [default devcontainer image]( https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-... https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration) . GitHub CLI [retrieves SSH connection details]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/inv... https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/invoker.go#L230-L244 ), such as remote username, which is used in [executing `ssh` commands]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L2... https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L263 ) for `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands.\n\nThis exploit occurs when a malicious third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects `ssh` arguments within the SSH connection details. `gh codespace ssh` and `gh codespace logs` commands could execute arbitrary code on the user's workstation if the remote username contains something like `-oProxyCommand=\"echo hacked\" #`.  The `-oProxyCommand` flag causes `ssh` to execute the provided command while `#` shell comment causes any other `ssh` arguments to be ignored.\n\nIn `2.62.0`, the remote username information is being validated before being used.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52308", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbCLIVersions  before (<) 2.62.0cpe:2.3:a:github:cli:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbCLIVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.61.0cpe:2.3:a:github:cli:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-24  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-21  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87", "ref_desc": "Connecting to a malicious Codespaces via GH CLI could allow command execution on the user's computer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cli/cli \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
