{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53859", "Description": "go-gh is a Go module for interacting with the `gh` utility and the GitHub API from the command line. A security vulnerability has been identified in `go-gh` that could leak authentication tokens intended for GitHub hosts to non-GitHub hosts when within a codespace. `go-gh` sources authentication tokens from different environment variables depending on the host involved: 1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub.com and ghe.com and 2. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` for GitHub Enterprise Server. Prior to version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` could source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for a host other than GitHub.com or ghe.com when within a codespace. In version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` will only source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub.com or ghe.com hosts. Successful exploitation could send authentication token to an unintended host. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users are also advised to regenerate authentication tokens and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53859", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/identifying-audit-log-events-performed-by-an-access-token", "ref_desc": "Identifying audit log events performed by an access token - GitHub Enterprise Cloud Docs", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-revoking-authorization-of-github-apps#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps", "ref_desc": "Reviewing and revoking authorization of GitHub Apps - GitHub Docs", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cli/go-gh/security/advisories/GHSA-55v3-xh23-96gh", "ref_desc": "`auth.TokenForHost` violates GitHub host security boundary when sourcing authentication token within a codespace \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cli/go-gh \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cli/go-gh/blob/71770357e0cb12867d3e3e288854c0aa09d440b7/pkg/auth/auth.go#L73-L77", "ref_desc": "go-gh/pkg/auth/auth.go at 71770357e0cb12867d3e3e288854c0aa09d440b7 \u00b7 cli/go-gh \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-security-log", "ref_desc": "Reviewing your security log - GitHub Docs", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens", "ref_desc": "Managing your personal access tokens - GitHub Enterprise Cloud Docs", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
