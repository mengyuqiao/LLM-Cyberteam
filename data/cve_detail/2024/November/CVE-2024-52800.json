{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52800", "Description": "veraPDF is an open source PDF/A validation library. Executing policy checks using custom schematron files via the CLI invokes an XSL transformation that may theoretically lead to a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. This doesn't affect the standard validation and policy checks functionality, veraPDF's common use cases. Most veraPDF users don't insert any custom XSLT code into policy profiles, which are based on Schematron syntax rather than direct XSL transforms. For users who do, only load custom policy files from sources you trust. This issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to be cautious of XSLT code until a patch is available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52800", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/veraPDF/veraPDF-library/security/advisories/GHSA-4cx5-89vm-833x", "ref_desc": "Potential XXE (XML External Entity Injection) vulnerability in veraPDF CLI \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 veraPDF/veraPDF-library \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/veraPDF/veraPDF-library/issues/1488", "ref_desc": "Potential XXE(XML External Entity Injection) vulnerability in veraPDFCli \u00b7 Issue #1488 \u00b7 veraPDF/veraPDF-library \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
