{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-51756", "Description": "The cap-std project is organized around the eponymous `cap-std` crate, and develops libraries to make it easy to write capability-based code. cap-std's filesystem sandbox implementation on Windows blocks access to special device filenames such as \"COM1\", \"COM2\", \"LPT0\", \"LPT1\", and so on, however it did not block access to the special device filenames which use superscript digits, such as \"COM\u00b9\", \"COM\u00b2\", \"LPT?\", \"LPT\u00b9\", and so on. Untrusted filesystem paths could bypass the sandbox and access devices through those special device filenames with superscript digits, and through them provide access peripheral devices connected to the computer, or network resources mapped to those devices. This can include modems, printers, network printers, and any other device connected to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB serial ports. The bug is fixed in #371, which is published in cap-primitives 3.4.1, cap-std 3.4.1, and cap-async-std 3.4.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue. Affected Windows users are recommended to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51756", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/pull/371", "ref_desc": "Add missing reserved file names by nathaniel-daniel \u00b7 Pull Request #371 \u00b7 bytecodealliance/cap-std \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KuULWrNsoCT8lA1jFZKLtKrJMOs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1", "ref_desc": "ISO/IEC 8859-1 - WikipediaCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pRWmK1UVA_caa8bVA-KIaBrPAv0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/security/advisories/GHSA-hxf5-99xg-86hw", "ref_desc": "cap-std doesn't fully sandbox all the Windows device filenames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bytecodealliance/cap-std \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/commit/dcc3818039761331fbeacbb3a40c542b65b5ebf7", "ref_desc": "Add missing reserved file names (#371) \u00b7 bytecodealliance/cap-std@dcc3818 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions", "ref_desc": "Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces - Win32 apps | Microsoft LearnCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZM2Pdg5YSC9BZ9NCCEpRmxG0_Xc.html"}]}
