{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52292", "Description": "Craft is a content management system (CMS). The dataUrl function can be exploited if an attacker has write permissions on system notification templates. This function accepts an absolute file path, reads the file's content, and converts it into a Base64-encoded string. By embedding this function within a system notification template, the attacker can exfiltrate the Base64-encoded file content through a triggered system email notification. Once the email is received, the Base64 payload can be decoded, allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. This is fixed in 5.4.9 and 4.12.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52292", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft CmsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0-alpha.1andbefore (<) 5.4.9cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft CmsVersions  from including (>=) 3.5.13andbefore (<) 4.12.8cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft CmsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.4.9cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-cw6g-qmjq-6w2w", "ref_desc": "Read Arbitrary System Files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 craftcms/cms \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
