{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50346", "Description": "WebFeed is a lightweight web feed reader extension for Firefox/Chrome. Multiple HTML injection vulnerabilities in WebFeed can lead to CSRF and UI spoofing attacks. A remote attacker can provide malicious RSS feeds and attract the victim user to visit it using WebFeed. The attacker can then inject malicious HTML into the extension page and fool the victim into sending out HTTP requests to arbitrary sites with the victim's credentials. Users are vulnerable to CSRF attacks when visiting malicious RSS feeds via WebFeed. Unwanted actions could be executed on the user's behalf on arbitrary websites. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.9.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50346", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/taoso/webfeed/security/advisories/GHSA-mrc7-2q3w-48j8", "ref_desc": "WebFeed HTML injection vulnerabilities leading to CSRF and UI spoofing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 taoso/webfeed \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/taoso/webfeed/commit/a2d1c1c3a98f30e0bd7a1bbcb746fae484985e6d", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 taoso/webfeed@a2d1c1c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
