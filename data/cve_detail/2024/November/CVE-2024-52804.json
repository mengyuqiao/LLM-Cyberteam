{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52804", "Description": "Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. The algorithm used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior to 6.4.2 sometimes has quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This parsing occurs in the event loop thread and may block the processing of other requests. Version 6.4.2 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52804", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/commit/d5ba4a1695fbf7c6a3e54313262639b198291533", "ref_desc": "httputil: Fix quadratic performance of cookie parsing \u00b7 tornadoweb/tornado@d5ba4a1 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7pwv-g7hj-39pr", "ref_desc": "There is a LOW severity vulnerability affecting CPython,... \u00b7 CVE-2024-7592 \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/security/advisories/GHSA-8w49-h785-mj3c", "ref_desc": "HTTP cookie parsing DoS vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tornadoweb/tornado \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
