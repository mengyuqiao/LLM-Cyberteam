{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52802", "Description": "RIOT is an operating system for internet of things (IoT) devices. In version 2024.04 and prior, the function `_parse_advertise`, located in `/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c`, has no minimum header length check for `dhcpv6_opt_t` after processing `dhcpv6_msg_t`. This omission could lead to an out-of-bound read, causing system inconsistency. Additionally, the same lack of a header length check is present in the function `_preparse_advertise`, which is called by `_parse_advertise` before handling the request. As of time of publication, no known patched version exists.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52802", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-xgv3-pcq6-qmrg", "ref_desc": "Missing dhcpv6_opt_t minimum header length check \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
