{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52309", "Description": "SFTPGo is a full-featured and highly configurable SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV server - S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob. One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52309", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/88b1850b5806eee81150873d4e565144b21021fb", "ref_desc": "EventManager: allow to define the allowed system commands \u00b7 drakkan/sftpgo@88b1850 \u00b7 GitHubmisc", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/security/advisories/GHSA-49cc-xrjf-9qf7", "ref_desc": "Restrict command execution from the EventManager \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 drakkan/sftpgo \u00b7 GitHubconfirm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/b524da11e9466d05fe03304713ee1c61bb276ec4", "ref_desc": "EventManager: disable commands by default \u00b7 drakkan/sftpgo@b524da1 \u00b7 GitHubmisc", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
