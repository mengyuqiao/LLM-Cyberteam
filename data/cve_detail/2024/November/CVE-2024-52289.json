{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52289", "Description": "authentik is an open-source identity provider. Redirect URIs in the OAuth2 provider in authentik are checked by RegEx comparison.\nWhen no Redirect URIs are configured in a provider, authentik will automatically use the first redirect_uri value received as an allowed redirect URI, without escaping characters that have a special meaning in RegEx. Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52289", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-185 Incorrect Regular Expression", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/185/Incorrect-Regular-Expression.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/85bb638243c8d7ea42ddd3b15b3f51a90d2b8c54", "ref_desc": "misc", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-3q5w-6m3x-64gj", "ref_desc": "confirm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
