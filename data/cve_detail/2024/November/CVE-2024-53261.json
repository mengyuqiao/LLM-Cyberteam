{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53261", "Description": "SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. \"Unsanitized input from *the request URL* flows into `end`, where it is used to render an HTML page returned to the user. This may result in a Cross-Site Scripting attack (XSS).\" The files `packages/kit/src/exports/vite/dev/index.js` and `packages/kit/src/exports/vite/utils.js` both contain user controllable data which under specific conditions may flow to dev mode pages. There is little to no expected impact. The Vite development is not exposed to the network by default and even if someone were able to trick a developer into executing an XSS against themselves, a development database should not have any sensitive data. None the less this issue has been addressed in version 2.8.3 and all users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53261", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/security/advisories/GHSA-rjjv-87mx-6x3h", "ref_desc": "XSS on dev mode 404 page \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sveltejs/kit \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/commit/d338d4635a7fd947ba5112df6ee632c4a0979438", "ref_desc": "fix: escape values included in dev 404 page (#13039) \u00b7 sveltejs/kit@d338d46 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
