{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52582", "Description": "Cachi2 is a command-line interface tool that pre-fetches a project's dependencies to aid in making the project's build process network-isolated. Prior to version 0.14.0, secrets may be shown in logs when an unhandled exception is triggered because the tool is logging locals of each function. This may uncover secrets if tool used in CI/build pipelines as it's the main use case. Version 0.14.0 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52582", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/497/Exposure-of-Sensitive-System-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/exceptions/?h=#disable-local-variables-for-security", "ref_desc": "Exceptions and Errors - Typer", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerbuildsystem/cachi2/security/advisories/GHSA-w9qc-9m5h-qqmh", "ref_desc": "Traceback prints locals \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 containerbuildsystem/cachi2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerbuildsystem/cachi2/commit/d6638e5e14474061a1ab1ba5d0ee72f58b9a11a9", "ref_desc": "fix(typer): do not log locals \u00b7 containerbuildsystem/cachi2@d6638e5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
