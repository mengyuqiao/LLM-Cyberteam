{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-51500", "Description": "Meshtastic firmware is a device firmware for the Meshtastic project. The Meshtastic firmware does not check for packets claiming to be from the special broadcast address (0xFFFFFFFF) which could result in unexpected behavior and potential for DDoS attacks on the network. A malicious actor could craft a packet to be from that address which would result in an amplification of this one message into every node on the network sending multiple messages. Such an attack could result in degraded network performance for all users as the available bandwidth is consumed. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.5.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51500", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-138 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/138/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-159 Improper Handling of Invalid Use of Special Elements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/159/Improper-Handling-of-Invalid-Use-of-Special-Elements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/security/advisories/GHSA-xfmq-5j3j-vgv8", "ref_desc": "Failure to check for packets from the broadcast address allows potential DDoS amplification attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 meshtastic/firmware \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
