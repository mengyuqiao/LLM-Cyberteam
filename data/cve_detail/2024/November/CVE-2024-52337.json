{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52337", "Description": "A log spoofing flaw was found in the Tuned package due to improper sanitization of some API arguments. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters; newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the 'evil' the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuned's D-Bus interface for such operations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52337", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10381", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2024:10381 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:11161", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2024:11161 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/11/28/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - tuned: local root exploit in D-Bus method instance_create and other issues in tuned >= 2.23 (CVE-2024-52336, CVE-2024-52337)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/a3sv_wrskNOOgeLkoGtgMlq1S2g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/11/28/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: tuned: local root exploit in D-Bus method instance_create and other issues in tuned >= 2.23 (CVE-2024-52336, CVE-2024-52337)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fZA5T8RnxdlywXQtPuBnb8vdEOI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2324541", "ref_desc": "2324541 \u2013 (CVE-2024-52337) CVE-2024-52337 tuned: improper sanitization of `instance_name` parameter of the `instance_create()` method", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.opensuse.org/2024/11/26/tuned-instance-create.html", "ref_desc": "tuned: local root exploit in D-Bus method instance_create and other issues in tuned >= 2.23 (CVE-2024-52336, CVE-2024-52337) | SUSE Security Team BlogCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QL3FiGc-SEiKWsW2thlDdTUHUAM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10384", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2024:10384 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xrcV8tTxat5zSBB9Kt4fjRTqG24.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-52337", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-52337 - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
