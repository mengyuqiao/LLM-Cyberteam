{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52587", "Description": "StepSecurity's Harden-Runner provides network egress filtering and runtime security for GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners. Versions of step-security/harden-runner prior to v2.10.2 contain multiple command injection weaknesses via environment variables that could potentially be exploited under specific conditions. However, due to the current execution order of pre-steps in GitHub Actions and the placement of harden-runner as the first step in a job, the likelihood of exploitation is low as the Harden-Runner action reads the environment variable during the pre-step stage. There are no known exploits at this time. Version 2.10.2 contains a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52587", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/security/advisories/GHSA-g85v-wf27-67xc", "ref_desc": "Command injection weaknesses in `setup.ts` and `arc-runner.ts` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 step-security/harden-runner \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L61", "ref_desc": "harden-runner/src/arc-runner.ts at 951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca \u00b7 step-security/harden-runner \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L40-L44", "ref_desc": "harden-runner/src/arc-runner.ts at 951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca \u00b7 step-security/harden-runner \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L53", "ref_desc": "harden-runner/src/arc-runner.ts at 951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca \u00b7 step-security/harden-runner \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/commit/0080882f6c36860b6ba35c610c98ce87d4e2f26f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #476 from step-security/rc-16 \u00b7 step-security/harden-runner@0080882 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/setup.ts#L229", "ref_desc": "harden-runner/src/setup.ts at 951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca \u00b7 step-security/harden-runner \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L57", "ref_desc": "harden-runner/src/arc-runner.ts at 951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca \u00b7 step-security/harden-runner \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/setup.ts#L169", "ref_desc": "harden-runner/src/setup.ts at 951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca \u00b7 step-security/harden-runner \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
