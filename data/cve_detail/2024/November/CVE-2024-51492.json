{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-51492", "Description": "Zusam is a free and open-source way to self-host private forums. Prior to version 0.5.6, specially crafted SVG files uploaded to the service as images allow for unrestricted script execution on (raw) image load. With certain payloads, theft of the target user\u2019s long-lived session token is possible. Note that Zusam, at the time of writing, uses a user\u2019s static API key as a long-lived session token, and these terms can be used interchangeably on the platform. This session token/API key remains valid indefinitely, so long as the user doesn\u2019t expressly request a new one via their Settings page. Version 0.5.6 fixes the cross-site scripting vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51492", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zusam/zusam/releases/tag/0.5.6", "ref_desc": "Release 0.5.6 \u00b7 zusam/zusam \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zusam/zusam/security/advisories/GHSA-96fx-5rqv-jfxh", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS allowing token theft via crafted SVG \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zusam/zusam \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zusam/zusam/commit/5930fdf86fa4abed01f0b345c8ec3c443656db9a", "ref_desc": "0.5.6 (#79) \u00b7 zusam/zusam@5930fdf \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pfeister.dev/CVE-2024-51492", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-51492 :: Zusam :: Paul Pfeister", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
