{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52296", "Description": "libosdp is an implementation of IEC 60839-11-5 OSDP (Open Supervised Device Protocol) and provides a C library with support for C++, Rust and Python3. At ospd_common.c, on the osdp_reply_name function, any reply id between REPLY_ACK and REPLY_XRD is valid, but names array do not declare all of the range. On a case of an undefined reply id within the range, name will be null (name = names[reply_id - REPLY_ACK];). Null name will casue a crash on next line: if (name[0] == '\\0') as null[0] is invalid. As this logic is not limited to a secure connection, attacker may trigger this vulnerability without any prior knowledge. This issue is fixed in 2.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52296", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp/commit/24409e98a260176765956ec766a04cb35984fab1", "ref_desc": "Fix null pointer deref issue osdp_reply_name \u00b7 goToMain/libosdp@24409e9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp/security/advisories/GHSA-7945-5mcv-f2pp", "ref_desc": "Null pointer deref in osdp_reply_name \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 goToMain/libosdp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
