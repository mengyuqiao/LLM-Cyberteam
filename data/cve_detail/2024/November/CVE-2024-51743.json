{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-51743", "Description": "MarkUs is a web application for the submission and grading of student assignments. In versions prior to 2.4.8, an arbitrary file write vulnerability in the update/upload/create file methods in Controllers allows authenticated instructors to write arbitrary files to any location on the web server MarkUs is running on (depending on the permissions of the underlying filesystem). e.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution in case an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the config/initializers/ subfolder of the Ruby on Rails application. MarkUs v2.4.8 has addressed this issue. No known workarounds are available at the application level aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51743", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus/pull/7026", "ref_desc": "Security updates (constantize and path injection) by david-yz-liu \u00b7 Pull Request #7026 \u00b7 MarkUsProject/Markus \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3hxUqtpUm1VJnsgcRA-z0Lxiins.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus/security/advisories/GHSA-hwgg-qvjx-572x", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Write leading up to remote code execution (from instructor accounts) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 MarkUsProject/Markus \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
