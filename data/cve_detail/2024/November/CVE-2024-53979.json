{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53979", "Description": "ibm.ibm_zhmc is an Ansible collection for the IBM Z HMC. The Ansible collection \"ibm.ibm_zhmc\" writes password-like properties in clear text into its log file and into the output returned by some of its Ansible module in the following cases: 1. The 'boot_ftp_password' and 'ssc_master_pw' properties are passed as input to the zhmc_partition Ansible module. 2. The 'ssc_master_pw' and 'zaware_master_pw' properties are passed as input to the zhmc_lpar Ansible module. 3. The 'password' property is passed as input to the zhmc_user Ansible module (just in log file, not in module output). 4. The 'bind_password' property is passed as input to the zhmc_ldap_server_definition Ansible module. These properties appear in the module output only when they were specified in the module input and when creating or updating the corresponding resources. They do not appear in the output when retrieving facts for the corresponding resources. These properties appear in the log file only when the \"log_file\" module input parameter is used. By default, no log file is created. This issue has been fixed in ibm.ibm_zhmc version 1.9.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53979", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-ansible-modules/security/advisories/GHSA-mw6c-f428-jx4f", "ref_desc": "Ansible collection \"ibm.ibm_zhmc\" has passwords in clear text in log file and in output of some modules when specified as input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zhmcclient/zhmc-ansible-modules \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-ansible-modules/commit/f5579f07da5f02d2496c41a313d4ae7a0a459b1d", "ref_desc": "Fixed return and logging of password-like props in clear text \u00b7 zhmcclient/zhmc-ansible-modules@f5579f0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
