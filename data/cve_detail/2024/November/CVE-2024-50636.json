{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50636", "Description": "PyMOL 2.5.0 contains a vulnerability in its \"Run Script\" function, which allows the execution of arbitrary Python code embedded within .PYM files. Attackers can craft a malicious .PYM file containing a Python reverse shell payload and exploit the function to achieve Remote Command Execution (RCE). This vulnerability arises because PyMOL treats .PYM files as Python scripts without properly validating or restricting the commands within the script, enabling attackers to run unauthorized commands in the context of the user running the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50636", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source/issues/405", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability notification \u00b7 Issue #405 \u00b7 schrodinger/pymol-open-source \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yamerooo123/CVE/blob/main/CVE-2024-50636/Description.md", "ref_desc": "CVE/CVE-2024-50636/Description.md at main \u00b7 yamerooo123/CVE \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://youtu.be/SWnN_a1tUNc", "ref_desc": "PyMOL - Remote Command Execution - YouTube", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
