{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50340", "Description": "symfony/runtime is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which enables decoupling PHP applications from global state. When the `register_argv_argc` php directive is set to `on` , and users call any URL with a special crafted query string, they are able to change the environment or debug mode used by the kernel when handling the request. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `SymfonyRuntime` now ignores the `argv` values for non-SAPI PHP runtimes. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50340", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-11-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/a77b308c3f179ed7c8a8bc295f82b2d6ee3493fa", "ref_desc": "Do not read from argv on non-CLI SAPIs \u00b7 symfony/symfony@a77b308 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-x8vp-gf4q-mw5j", "ref_desc": "Ability to change environment from query \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
