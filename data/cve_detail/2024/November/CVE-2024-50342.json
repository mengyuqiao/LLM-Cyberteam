{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50342", "Description": "symfony/http-client is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides powerful methods to fetch HTTP resources synchronously or asynchronously. When using the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`, some internal information is still leaking during host resolution, which leads to possible IP/port enumeration. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` now filters blocked IPs earlier to prevent such leaks. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50342", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/296d4b34a33b1a6ca5475c6040b3203622520f5b", "ref_desc": "[HttpClient] Filter private IPs before connecting when Host == IP \u00b7 symfony/symfony@296d4b3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-9c3x-r3wp-mgxm", "ref_desc": "Internal address and port enumeration allowed by NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
