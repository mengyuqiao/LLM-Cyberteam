{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52796", "Description": "Password Pusher, an open source application to communicate sensitive information over the web, comes with a configurable rate limiter.  In versions prior to v1.49.0, the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site potentially causing a denial of service. In v1.49.0, a fix was implemented to only authorize proxies on local IPs which resolves this issue. As a workaround, one may add rules to one's proxy and/or firewall to not accept external proxy headers such as `X-Forwarded-*` from clients.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52796", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/security/advisories/GHSA-ffp2-8p2h-4m5j", "ref_desc": "Rate limiter can be bypassed by forging proxy headers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pglombardo/PasswordPusher \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.49.0: Trust Only Local Proxies Unless Overridden \u00b7 pglombardo/PasswordPusher \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/proxies/#trusted-proxies", "ref_desc": "Proxies & Password Pusher - Password Pusher", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
