When Atlantis is used to administer a GitHub organization, this enables getting administration privileges on the organization. This was reported in #4060 and fixed in #4667 . The fix was included in Atlantis v0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52009", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/tag/v0.30.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.30.0 \u00b7 runatlantis/atlantis \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/security", "ref_desc": "Overview - Argo CD - Declarative GitOps CD for Kubernetes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/4667", "ref_desc": "fix: dont log GitHub app token in logs by dobby-dobster \u00b7 Pull Request #4667 \u00b7 runatlantis/atlantis \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/security/advisories/GHSA-gppm-hq3p-h4rp", "ref_desc": "Git credentials are exposed in atlantis logs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 runatlantis/atlantis \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060", "ref_desc": "Git credentials are exposed in atlantis logs \u00b7 Issue #4060 \u00b7 runatlantis/atlantis \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
