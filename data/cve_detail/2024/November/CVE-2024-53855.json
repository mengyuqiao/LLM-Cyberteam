{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53855", "Description": "Centurion ERP (Enterprise Rescource Planning) is a simple application developed to provide open source IT management with a large emphasis on the IT Service Management (ITSM) modules. A user who is authenticated and has view permissions for a ticket, can view the tickets of another organization they are not apart of. Users with following permissions are applicable: 1. `view_ticket_change` permission can view change tickets from organizations they are not apart of. 2. `view_ticket_incident` permission can view incident tickets from organizations they are not apart of. 3. `view_ticket_request` permission can view request tickets from organizations they are not apart of. 4. `view_ticket_problem` permission can view problem tickets from organizations they are not apart of. The access to view the tickets from different organizations is only applicable when browsing the API endpoints for the tickets in question. The Centurion UI is not affected. Project Tasks, although a \"ticket type\" are also **Not** affected. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.1 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may remove the ticket view permissions from users which would alleviate this vulnerability, if this is deemed not-viable, Upgrading is recommended.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53855", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-653 Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/653/Improper-Isolation-or-Compartmentalization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nofusscomputing/centurion_erp/pull/399", "ref_desc": "fix(core): Ensure user cant view tickets in orgs they are not part of by jon-nfc \u00b7 Pull Request #399 \u00b7 nofusscomputing/centurion_erp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nofusscomputing/centurion_erp/releases/tag/1.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release 1.3.1 \u00b7 nofusscomputing/centurion_erp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nofusscomputing/centurion_erp/security/advisories/GHSA-h9q2-fcc6-r65c", "ref_desc": "User can view tickets from organizations they're not apart of \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nofusscomputing/centurion_erp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nofusscomputing/centurion_erp/pull/399/commits/61f34876ed0f8362f7185bd5eecfc830a9de5cb0", "ref_desc": "fix(core): Ensure user cant view tickets in orgs they are not part of by jon-nfc \u00b7 Pull Request #399 \u00b7 nofusscomputing/centurion_erp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
