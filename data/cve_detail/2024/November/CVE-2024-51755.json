{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-51755", "Description": "Twig is a template language for PHP. In a sandbox, an attacker can access attributes of Array-like objects as they were not checked by the security policy. They are now checked via the property policy and the `__isset()` method is now called after the security check. This is a BC break. This issue has been patched in versions 3.11.2 and 3.14.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51755", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/commit/831c148e786178e5f2fde9db67266be3bf241c21", "ref_desc": "Sandbox ArrayAccess and do sandbox checks before isset() checks \u00b7 twigphp/Twig@831c148 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/security/advisories/GHSA-jjxq-ff2g-95vh", "ref_desc": "Unguarded calls to __isset() and to array-accesses in a sandbox \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 twigphp/Twig \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
