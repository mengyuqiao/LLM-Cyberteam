{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52525", "Description": "Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. Under certain conditions the password of a user was stored unencrypted in the session data. The session data is encrypted before being saved in the session storage (Redis or disk), but it would allow a malicious process that gains access to the memory of the PHP process, to get access to the cleartext password of the user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52525", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "1.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-w7v5-mgxm-v6gm", "ref_desc": "User password is available in memory of the PHP process \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/48915", "ref_desc": "fix: encrypt and store password, decrypt and retrieve the same by yemkareems \u00b7 Pull Request #48915 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/commit/d25a0a2896a2a981939cacb8ee0d555feef22b3b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #48915 from nextcloud/fix/encrypt-decrypt-password \u00b7 nextcloud/server@d25a0a2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
