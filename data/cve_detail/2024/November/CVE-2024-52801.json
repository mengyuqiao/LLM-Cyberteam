{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52801", "Description": "sftpgo is a full-featured and highly configurable event-driven file transfer solution. Server protocols: SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S, WebDAV. The OpenID Connect implementation allows authenticated users to brute force session cookies and thereby gain access to other users' data, since the cookies are generated predictably using the xid library and are therefore unique but not cryptographically secure. This issue was fixed in version v2.6.4, where cookies are opaque and cryptographically secure strings. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52801", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rs/xid", "ref_desc": "GitHub - rs/xid: xid is a globally unique id generator thought for the web", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/security/advisories/GHSA-6943-qr24-82vx", "ref_desc": "Brute force takeover of OpenID Connect session cookies \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 drakkan/sftpgo \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/f30a9a2095bf90c0661b04fe038e3b7efc788bc6", "ref_desc": "OIDC cookie: use a cryptographically secure random string \u00b7 drakkan/sftpgo@f30a9a2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
