{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-51493", "Description": "OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain a vulnerability that allows an attacker that has gained temporary control over an authenticated victim's OctoPrint browser session to retrieve/recreate/delete the user's or - if the victim has admin permissions - the global API key without having to reauthenticate by re-entering the user account's password. An attacker could use a stolen API key to access OctoPrint through its API, or disrupt workflows depending on the API key they deleted. This vulnerability will be patched in version 1.10.3 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51493", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctoprint\u00bbOctoprintVersions  before (<) 1.10.3cpe:2.3:a:octoprint:octoprint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-19  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-620 Unverified Password Change", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/620/Unverified-Password-Change.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/security/advisories/GHSA-cc6x-8cc7-9953", "ref_desc": "API key access in settings without reauthentication \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OctoPrint/OctoPrint \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
