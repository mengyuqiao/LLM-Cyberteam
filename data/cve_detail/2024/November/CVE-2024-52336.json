{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52336", "Description": "A script injection vulnerability was identified in the Tuned package. The `instance_create()` D-Bus function can be called by locally logged-in users without authentication. This flaw allows a local non-privileged user to execute a D-Bus call with `script_pre` or `script_post` options that permit arbitrary scripts with their absolute paths to be passed. These user or attacker-controlled executable scripts or programs could then be executed by Tuned with root privileges that could allow attackers to local privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52336", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/11/28/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - tuned: local root exploit in D-Bus method instance_create and other issues in tuned >= 2.23 (CVE-2024-52336, CVE-2024-52337)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/a3sv_wrskNOOgeLkoGtgMlq1S2g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-52336", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-52336 - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/11/28/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: tuned: local root exploit in D-Bus method instance_create and other issues in tuned >= 2.23 (CVE-2024-52336, CVE-2024-52337)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fZA5T8RnxdlywXQtPuBnb8vdEOI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2324540", "ref_desc": "2324540 \u2013 (CVE-2024-52336) CVE-2024-52336 tuned: `script_pre` and `script_post` options allow to pass arbitrary scripts executed by root", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.opensuse.org/2024/11/26/tuned-instance-create.html", "ref_desc": "tuned: local root exploit in D-Bus method instance_create and other issues in tuned >= 2.23 (CVE-2024-52336, CVE-2024-52337) | SUSE Security Team BlogCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QL3FiGc-SEiKWsW2thlDdTUHUAM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10384", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2024:10384 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xrcV8tTxat5zSBB9Kt4fjRTqG24.html"}]}
