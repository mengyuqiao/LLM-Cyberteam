{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52010", "Description": "Zoraxy is a general purpose HTTP reverse proxy and forwarding tool. A command injection vulnerability in the Web SSH feature allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the host. Zoraxy has a Web SSH terminal feature that allows authenticated users to connect to SSH servers from their browsers. In HandleCreateProxySession the request to create an SSH session is handled. An attacker can exploit the username variable to escape from the bash command and inject arbitrary commands into sshCommand. This is possible, because, unlike hostname and port, the username is not validated or sanitized.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52010", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tobychui/zoraxy/commit/c07d5f85dfc37bd32819358ed7d4bc32c604e8f0", "ref_desc": "v2 init commit \u00b7 tobychui/zoraxy@c07d5f8 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tobychui/zoraxy/commit/2e9bc77a5d832bff1093058d42ce7a61382e4bc6", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 tobychui/zoraxy@2e9bc77 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tobychui/zoraxy/security/advisories/GHSA-7hpf-g48v-hw3j", "ref_desc": "Authenticated command injection in Web SSH feature \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tobychui/zoraxy \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
