{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-51745", "Description": "Wasmtime is a fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime's filesystem sandbox implementation on Windows blocks access to special device filenames such as \"COM1\", \"COM2\", \"LPT0\", \"LPT1\", and so on, however it did not block access to the special device filenames which use superscript digits, such as \"COM\u00b9\", \"COM\u00b2\", \"LPT?\", \"LPT\u00b9\", and so on. Untrusted Wasm programs that are given access to any filesystem directory could bypass the sandbox and access devices through those special device filenames with superscript digits, and through them gain access peripheral devices connected to the computer, or network resources mapped to those devices. This can include modems, printers, network printers, and any other device connected to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB serial ports. Patch releases for Wasmtime have been issued as 24.0.2, 25.0.3, and 26.0.1. Users of Wasmtime 23.0.x and prior are recommended to upgrade to one of these patched versions. There are no known workarounds for this issue. Affected Windows users are recommended to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51745", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-67 Improper Handling of Windows Device Names", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/67/Improper-Handling-of-Windows-Device-Names.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/184/Incomplete-List-of-Disallowed-Inputs.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-c2f5-jxjv-2hh8", "ref_desc": "Wasmtime doesn't fully sandbox all the Windows device filenames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std/pull/371", "ref_desc": "Add missing reserved file names by nathaniel-daniel \u00b7 Pull Request #371 \u00b7 bytecodealliance/cap-std \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KuULWrNsoCT8lA1jFZKLtKrJMOs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1", "ref_desc": "ISO/IEC 8859-1 - WikipediaCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pRWmK1UVA_caa8bVA-KIaBrPAv0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions", "ref_desc": "Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces - Win32 apps | Microsoft LearnCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZM2Pdg5YSC9BZ9NCCEpRmxG0_Xc.html"}]}
