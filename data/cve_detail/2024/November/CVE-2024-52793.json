{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52793", "Description": "The Deno Standard Library provides APIs for Deno and the Web. Prior to version 1.0.11, `http/file-server`'s `serveDir` with `showDirListing: true` option is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when the attacker is a user who can control file names in the source directory on systems with POSIX file names. Exploitation might also be possible on other systems but less trivial due to e.g. lack of file name support for `<>` in Windows. Version 1.0.11 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52793", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/std/blob/065296ca5a05a47f9741df8f99c32fae4f960070/http/file_server.ts#L507", "ref_desc": "std/http/file_server.ts at 065296ca5a05a47f9741df8f99c32fae4f960070 \u00b7 denoland/std \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/std/blob/065296ca5a05a47f9741df8f99c32fae4f960070/http/file_server.ts#L532", "ref_desc": "std/http/file_server.ts at 065296ca5a05a47f9741df8f99c32fae4f960070 \u00b7 denoland/std \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/std/security/advisories/GHSA-32fx-h446-h8pf", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability in serveDir API of @std/http/file-server on POSIX systems \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/std \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
