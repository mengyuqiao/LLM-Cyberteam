{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-51735", "Description": "Osmedeus is a Workflow Engine for Offensive Security. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) occurs on the Osmedues web server when viewing results from the workflow, allowing commands to be executed on the server. When using a workflow that contains the summary module, it generates reports in HTML and Markdown formats. The default report is based on the `general-template.md` template.The contents of the files are read and used to generate the report. However, the file contents are not properly filtered, leading to XSS. This may lead to commands executed on the host as well. This issue is not yet resolved. Users are advised to add their own filtering or to reach out to the developer to aid in developing a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51735", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/j3ssie/osmedeus/security/advisories/GHSA-wvv7-wm5v-w2gv", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS to RCE on Osmedeus Web Server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 j3ssie/osmedeus \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
