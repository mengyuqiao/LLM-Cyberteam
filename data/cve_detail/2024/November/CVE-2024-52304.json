{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-52304", "Description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.10.11, the Python parser parses newlines in chunk extensions incorrectly which can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS` is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.10.11 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52304", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-8495-4g3g-x7pr", "ref_desc": "Request smuggling due to incorrect parsing of chunk extensions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/259edc369075de63e6f3a4eaade058c62af0df71", "ref_desc": "[PR #9851/541d86d backport][3.10] Fix incorrect parsing of chunk exte\u2026 \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp@259edc3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
