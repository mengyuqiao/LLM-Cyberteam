{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26149", "Description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. If an excessively large value is specified as the starting index for an array in `_abi_decode`, it can cause the read position to overflow. This results in the decoding of values outside the intended array bounds, potentially leading to exploitations in contracts that use arrays within `_abi_decode`. This vulnerability affects 0.3.10 and earlier versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26149", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-9p8r-4xp4-gw5w", "ref_desc": "_abi_decode Memory Overflow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
