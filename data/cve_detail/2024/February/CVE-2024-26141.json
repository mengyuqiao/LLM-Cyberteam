{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26141", "Description": "Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Carefully crafted Range headers can cause a server to respond with an unexpectedly large response. Responding with such large responses could lead to a denial of service issue. Vulnerable applications will use the `Rack::File` middleware or the `Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` methods (this includes Rails applications). The vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.9.1 and 2.2.8.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26141", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0007/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-26141 Rack Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/4849132bef471adb21131980df745f4bb84de2d9", "ref_desc": "Return an empty array when ranges are too large \u00b7 rack/rack@4849132 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/possible-dos-vulnerability-with-range-header-in-rack/84944", "ref_desc": "Possible DoS Vulnerability with Range Header in Rack - Security Announcements - Ruby on Rails Discussions", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-xj5v-6v4g-jfw6", "ref_desc": "Possible DoS Vulnerability with Range Header in Rack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rack/rack \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/rack/CVE-2024-26141.yml", "ref_desc": "ruby-advisory-db/gems/rack/CVE-2024-26141.yml at master \u00b7 rubysec/ruby-advisory-db \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/62457686b26d33a15a254c7768c2076e8e02b48b", "ref_desc": "Return an empty array when ranges are too large \u00b7 rack/rack@6245768 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00022.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3800-1] ruby-rack security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rRcrVt4ccVU9JpyvGS2tjxrfuJI.html"}]}
