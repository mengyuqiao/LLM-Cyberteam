{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23325", "Description": "Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy crashes in Proxy protocol when using an address type that isn\u2019t supported by the OS. Envoy is susceptible to crashing on a host with IPv6 disabled and a listener config with proxy protocol enabled when it receives a request where the client presents its IPv6 address.  It is valid for a client to present its IPv6 address to a target server even though the whole chain is connected via IPv4. This issue has been addressed in released 1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, and 1.26.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23325", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.26.0andbefore (<) 1.26.7cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.27.0andbefore (<) 1.27.3cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.29.0andbefore (<) 1.29.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.28.0andbefore (<) 1.28.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-15  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/bacd3107455b8d387889467725eb72aa0d5b5237", "ref_desc": "Fix crash when proxy protocol receives an address type that isn't \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy@bacd310 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-5m7c-mrwr-pm26", "ref_desc": "Envoy crashes when using an address type that isn\u2019t supported by the OS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
