{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25121", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. In affected versions of TYPO3 entities of the File Abstraction Layer (FAL) could be persisted directly via `DataHandler`. This allowed attackers to reference files in the fallback storage directly and retrieve their file names and contents. The fallback storage (\"zero-storage\") is used as a backward compatibility layer for files located outside properly configured file storages and within the public web root directory. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 version 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, or 13.0.1 which fix the problem described. When persisting entities of the File Abstraction Layer directly via DataHandler, `sys_file` entities are now denied by default, and `sys_file_reference` & `sys_file_metadata` entities are not permitted to reference files in the fallback storage anymore. When importing data from secure origins, this must be explicitly enabled in the corresponding DataHandler instance by using `$dataHandler->isImporting = true;`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25121", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andbefore (<) 12.4.11cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.43cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.7.57cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.5.35cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.46cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3\u00bbVersion:13.0.0cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:13.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-rj3x-wvc6-5j66", "ref_desc": "Improper Access Control Persisting File Abstraction Layer Entities via Data Handler \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2024-006", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2024-006: Improper Access Control Persisting File Abstraction Layer Entities via Data HandlerVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
