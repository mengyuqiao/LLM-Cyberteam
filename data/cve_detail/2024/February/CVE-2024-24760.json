{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24760", "Description": "mailcow is a dockerized email package, with multiple containers linked in one bridged network. A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions < 2024-01c. This vulnerability potentially allows attackers on the same subnet to connect to exposed ports of a Docker container, even when the port is bound to 127.0.0.1. The vulnerability has been addressed by implementing additional iptables/nftables rules. These rules drop packets for Docker containers on ports 3306, 6379, 8983, and 12345, where the input interface is not `br-mailcow` and the output interface is `br-mailcow`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24760", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMailcow\u00bbMailcow: DockerizedVersions  before (<) 2024-01ccpe:2.3:a:mailcow:mailcow\\:_dockerized:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/commit/087481ac12bfa5dd715f3630f0b1697be94f7e88", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #5696 from mailcow/fix/netfilter \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized@087481a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-gmpj-5xcm-xxx6", "ref_desc": "Docker Container Exposure to Local Network \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
