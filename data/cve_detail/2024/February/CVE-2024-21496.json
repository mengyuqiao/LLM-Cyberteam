{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21496", "Description": "All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the Referer header, due to improper input sanitization. Although the Referer header is sanitized by escaping some characters that can allow XSS (e.g., [&], [<], [>], [\"], [']), it does not account for the attack based on the JavaScript URL scheme (e.g., javascript:alert(document.domain)// payload). Exploiting this vulnerability may not be trivial, but it could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the target user\u2019s browser, compromising user sessions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21496", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security/issues/267", "ref_desc": "Referer-Based Header XSS \u00b7 Issue #267 \u00b7 greenpau/caddy-security \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/09/18/security-flaws-in-an-sso-plugin-for-caddy/", "ref_desc": "Security flaws in an SSO plugin for Caddy | Trail of Bits BlogCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/viclJFKS43mBUKoF5yafhOmvtKM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMGREENPAUCADDYSECURITY-6249860", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in github.com/greenpau/caddy-security | CVE-2024-21496 | Snyk", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
