{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25124", "Description": "Fiber is a web framework written in go. Prior to version 2.52.1, the CORS middleware allows for insecure configurations that could potentially expose the application to multiple CORS-related vulnerabilities. Specifically, it allows setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to a wildcard (`*`) while also having the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials set to true, which goes against recommended security best practices. The impact of this misconfiguration is high as it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data and expose the system to various types of attacks listed in the PortSwigger article linked in the references. Version 2.52.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, users may manually validate the CORS configurations in their implementation to ensure that they do not allow a wildcard origin when credentials are enabled. The browser fetch api, as well as browsers and utilities that enforce CORS policies, are not affected by this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25124", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-942 Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/942/Permissive-Cross-domain-Policy-with-Untrusted-Domains.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSNotSupportingCredentials", "ref_desc": "Reason: Credential is not supported if the CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' is '*' - HTTP | MDN", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/commit/f0cd3b44b086544a37886232d0530601f2406c23", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-fmg4-x8pw-hjhg \u00b7 gofiber/fiber@f0cd3b4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/10/exploiting-cors-misconfigurations-for.html", "ref_desc": "Exploiting CORS misconfigurations for Bitcoins and bounties | PortSwigger Research", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://saturncloud.io/blog/cors-cannot-use-wildcard-in-accesscontrolalloworigin-when-credentials-flag-is-true", "ref_desc": "Saturn Cloud | #1 Rated ML Platform", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-cors-misconfiguration-for-credentials", "ref_desc": "CORS misconfiguration for credentials transfer \u2014 CodeQL query help documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-protocol-and-credentials", "ref_desc": "Fetch Standard", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/releases/tag/v2.52.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.52.1 \u00b7 gofiber/fiber \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-fmg4-x8pw-hjhg", "ref_desc": "Insecure CORS Configuration Allowing Wildcard Origin with Credentials \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gofiber/fiber \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
