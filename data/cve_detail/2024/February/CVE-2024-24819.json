{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24819", "Description": "icingaweb2-module-incubator is a working project of bleeding edge Icinga Web 2 libraries. In affected versions the class `gipfl\\Web\\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default. This is done by automatically adding an element with a CSRF token to any form, unless explicitly disabled, but even if enabled, the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form relying on it) is not validated. This enables attackers to perform changes on behalf of a user which, unknowingly, interacts with a prepared link or website. The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24819", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaweb2-module-incubatorVersions  before (<) 0.22.0cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icingaweb2-module-incubator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator/commit/db7dc49585fee0b4e96be666d7f6009a74a1ccb5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-p8vv-9pqq-rm8p \u00b7 Icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator@db7dc49 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/search?q=gipfl%5CWeb%5CForm%3B&type=code", "ref_desc": "Code search results \u00b7 GitHubPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator/security/advisories/GHSA-p8vv-9pqq-rm8p", "ref_desc": "Base implementation for HTML forms is susceptible to CSRF \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
