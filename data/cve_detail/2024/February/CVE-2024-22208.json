{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22208", "Description": "phpMyFAQ is an Open Source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and other databases. The 'sharing FAQ' functionality allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application to send arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. The phpMyFAQ application has a functionality where anyone can share a FAQ item to others. The front-end of this functionality allows any phpMyFAQ articles to be shared with 5 email addresses. Any unauthenticated actor can perform this action. There is a CAPTCHA in place, however the amount of people you email with a single request is not limited to 5 by the backend. An attacker can thus solve a single CAPTCHA and send thousands of emails at once. An attacker can utilize the target application's email server to send phishing messages. This can get the server on a blacklist, causing all emails to end up in spam. It can also lead to reputation damages. This issue has been patched in version 3.2.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22208", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPhpmyfaq\u00bbPhpmyfaqVersions  before (<) 3.2.5cpe:2.3:a:phpmyfaq:phpmyfaq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/a34d94ab7b1be9256a9ef898f18ea6bfb63f6f1e", "ref_desc": "fix: only allow 5 mails per user, don't allow the user to change the URL \u00b7 thorsten/phpMyFAQ@a34d94a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-9hhf-xmcw-r3xg", "ref_desc": "Sharing FAQ functionality can easily be abused for phishing purposes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 thorsten/phpMyFAQ \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
