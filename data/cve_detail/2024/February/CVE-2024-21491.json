{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21491", "Description": "Versions of the package svix before 1.17.0 are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass due to an issue in the verify function where signatures of different lengths are incorrectly compared. An attacker can bypass signature verification by providing a shorter signature that matches the beginning of the actual signature.\r\r**Note:**\r\rThe attacker would need to know a victim uses the Rust library for verification,no easy way to automatically check that; and uses webhooks by a service that uses Svix, and then figure out a way to craft a malicious payload that will actually include all of the correct identifiers needed to trick the receivers to cause actual issues.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21491", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSvix\u00bbSvixVersions  before (<) 1.17.0cpe:2.3:a:svix:svix:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/288/Authentication-Bypass-Using-an-Alternate-Path-or-Channel.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1190", "ref_desc": "Rust verification library: fix comparison of different length signatures by tasn \u00b7 Pull Request #1190 \u00b7 svix/svix-webhooks \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/commit/958821bd3b956d1436af65f70a0964d4ffb7daf6", "ref_desc": "Rust verification library: fix comparison of different length signatu\u2026 \u00b7 svix/svix-webhooks@958821b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUST-SVIX-6230729", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass in svix | CVE-2024-21491 | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0010.html", "ref_desc": "RUSTSEC-2024-0010: svix: Improper comparison of different-length signatures \u203a RustSec Advisory DatabaseThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
