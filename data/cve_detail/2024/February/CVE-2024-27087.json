{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27087", "Description": "Kirby is a content management system. The new link field introduced in Kirby 4 allows several different link types that each validate the entered link to the relevant URL format. It also includes a \"Custom\" link type for advanced use cases that don't fit any of the pre-defined link formats.  As the \"Custom\" link type is meant to be flexible, it also allows the javascript: URL scheme. In some use cases this can be intended, but it can also be misused by attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when a user or visitor clicks on a link that is generated from the contents of the link field. This vulnerability is patched in 4.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27087", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/cda3dd9a15228d35e62ff86cfa87a67e7c687437", "ref_desc": "Link field: Don\u2019t allow custom type by default \u00b7 getkirby/kirby@cda3dd9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-63h4-w25c-3qv4", "ref_desc": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) in the link field \"Custom\" type \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
