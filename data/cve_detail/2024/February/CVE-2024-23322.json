{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23322", "Description": "Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy will crash when certain timeouts happen within the same interval. The crash occurs when the following are true: 1. hedge_on_per_try_timeout is enabled, 2. per_try_idle_timeout is enabled (it can only be done in configuration), 3. per-try-timeout is enabled, either through headers or configuration and its value is equal, or within the backoff interval of the per_try_idle_timeout. This issue has been addressed in released 1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, and 1.26.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23322", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.26.0andbefore (<) 1.26.7cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.27.0andbefore (<) 1.27.3cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.29.0andbefore (<) 1.29.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.28.0andbefore (<) 1.28.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-15  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/843f9e6a123ed47ce139b421c14e7126f2ac685e", "ref_desc": "Fix crash when idle and request per try timeouts occur within backoff\u2026 \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy@843f9e6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-6p83-mfmh-qv38", "ref_desc": "Envoy crashes when idle and request per try timeout occur within the backoff interval \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
