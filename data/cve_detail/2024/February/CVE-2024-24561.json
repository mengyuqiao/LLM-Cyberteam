{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24561", "Description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.10 and earlier, the bounds check for slices does not account for the ability for start + length to overflow when the values aren't literals. If a slice() function uses a non-literal argument for the start or length variable, this creates the ability for an attacker to overflow the bounds check. This issue can be used to do OOB access to storage, memory or calldata addresses. It can also be used to corrupt the length slot of the respective array.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24561", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyper\u00bbForPythonVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.3.10cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-10  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/b01cd686aa567b32498fefd76bd96b0597c6f099/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L404-L457", "ref_desc": "vyper/vyper/builtins/functions.py at b01cd686aa567b32498fefd76bd96b0597c6f099 \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-9x7f-gwxq-6f2c", "ref_desc": "Bounds check on built-in `slice()` function can be overflowed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/3756", "ref_desc": "invalid bounds check for `slice()` \u00b7 Issue #3756 \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
