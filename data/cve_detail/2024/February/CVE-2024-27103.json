{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27103", "Description": "Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI. When a user searches for their queries, datadocs, tables and lists, the search result is marked and highlighted, and this feature uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which means that if the highlighted result has an XSS payload it will trigger. While the input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML is not sanitized for the data inside of queries which leads to an XSS vulnerability. During the \"query auto-suggestion\" the name of the suggested tables are set with innerHTML which leads to the XSS vulnerability. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version 3.31.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27103", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/security/advisories/GHSA-3hjm-9277-5c88", "ref_desc": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting allows Privilege Elevation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pinterest/querybook \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/commit/449bdc9e7d679e042c3718b7ed07d2ffa3c46a8f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-3hjm-9277-5c88 \u00b7 pinterest/querybook@449bdc9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
