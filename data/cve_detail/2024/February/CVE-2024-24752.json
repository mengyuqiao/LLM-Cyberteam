{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24752", "Description": "Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and for each which contains a file, it is extracted and saved in `/tmp` with a random filename starting with `bref_upload_`. The flow mimics what plain PHP does but it does not delete the temporary files when the request has been processed. An attacker could fill the Lambda instance disk by performing multiple MultiPart requests containing files. This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24752", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMnapoli\u00bbBrefVersions  before (<) 2.1.13cpe:2.3:a:mnapoli:bref:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/brefphp/bref/security/advisories/GHSA-x4hh-frx8-98r5", "ref_desc": "Uploaded Files Not Deleted in Event-Driven Functions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 brefphp/bref \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/brefphp/bref/commit/350788de12880b6fd64c4c318ba995388bec840e", "ref_desc": "Support malformed multipart body \u00b7 brefphp/bref@350788d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
