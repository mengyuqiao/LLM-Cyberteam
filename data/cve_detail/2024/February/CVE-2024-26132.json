{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26132", "Description": "Element Android is an Android Matrix Client. A third-party malicious application installed on the same phone can force Element Android, version 0.91.0 through 1.6.12, to share files stored under the `files` directory in the application's private data directory to an arbitrary room. The impact of the attack is reduced by the fact that the databases stored in this folder are encrypted. However, it contains some other potentially sensitive information, such as the FCM token. Forks of Element Android which have set `android:exported=\"false\"` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for the `IncomingShareActivity` activity are not impacted. This issue is fixed in Element Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround to mitigate the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26132", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://element.io/blog/security-release-element-android-1-6-12", "ref_desc": "Security release: Element Android 1.6.12CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EF90tJH-WgqRyUH_bC8O6Vz5zno.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/security/advisories/GHSA-8wj9-cx7h-pvm4", "ref_desc": "Element Android can be forced to share internal files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 element-hq/element-android \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/commit/8f9695a9a8d944cb9b92568cbd76578c51d32e07", "ref_desc": "Store temporary files created for Camera in the media folder. \u00b7 element-hq/element-android@8f9695a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
