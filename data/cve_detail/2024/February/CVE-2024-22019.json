{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22019", "Description": "A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS). The server reads an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk extension bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion, bypassing standard safeguards like timeouts and body size limits.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22019", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0004/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-22019 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/2233486", "ref_desc": "Node.js | Report #2233486 - http: Reading unprocessed HTTP request with unbounded chunk extension allows DoS attacks | HackerOne", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - NodeJS v{18.x,20.x,21.x} February Security UpdatesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/V_YjBD7pkf4KuBkSCo3K6xlAajY.html"}]}
