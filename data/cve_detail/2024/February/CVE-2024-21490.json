{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21490", "Description": "This affects versions of the package angular from 1.3.0. A regular expression used to split the value of the ng-srcset directive is vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking. With large carefully-crafted input, this can result in catastrophic backtracking and cause a denial of service. \r\r\r**Note:**\r\rThis package is EOL and will not receive any updates to address this issue. Users should migrate to [@angular/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/core).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21490", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nAngularjs\u00bbAngular.jsVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:angularjs:angular.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-6091113", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in angular | CVE-2024-21490 | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-6241747", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in org.webjars.npm:angular | CVE-2024-21490 | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSBOWER-6241746", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in org.webjars.bower:angular | CVE-2024-21490 | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://stackblitz.com/edit/angularjs-vulnerability-ng-srcset-redos", "ref_desc": "AngularJS vulnerability: `ng-srcset` parsing ReDoS - StackBlitzExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.herodevs.com/hc/en-us/articles/25715686953485-CVE-2024-21490-AngularJS-Regular-Expression-Denial-of-Service-ReDoS", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-21490 - AngularJS Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) \u2013 HeroDevsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
