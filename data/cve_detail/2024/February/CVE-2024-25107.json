{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25107", "Description": "WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki managed farm to display wikis. On Special:WikiDiscover, the `Language::date` function is used when making the human-readable timestamp for inclusion on the wiki_creation column. This function uses interface messages to translate the names of months and days. It uses the `->text()` output mode, returning unescaped interface messages. Since the output is not escaped later, the unescaped interface message is included on the output, resulting in an XSS vulnerability. Exploiting this on-wiki requires the `(editinterface)` right. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `267e763a0`. Users are advised to update their installations. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25107", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMiraheze\u00bbWikidiscoverVersions  before (<) 2023-02-08cpe:2.3:a:miraheze:wikidiscover:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T11814", "ref_desc": "Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/commit/267e763a0d7460f001693c42f67717a0fc3fd6bb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-cfcf-94jv-455f \u00b7 miraheze/WikiDiscover@267e763 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/security/advisories/GHSA-cfcf-94jv-455f", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting on Special:WikiDiscover \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 miraheze/WikiDiscover \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
