{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26148", "Description": "Querybook is a user interface for querying big data. Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26148", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/pull/1412", "ref_desc": "fix: XSS injection with Querybook RichTextEditor by czgu \u00b7 Pull Request #1412 \u00b7 pinterest/querybook \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/security/advisories/GHSA-fh6g-gvvp-587f", "ref_desc": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting allows Privilege Evelvation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pinterest/querybook \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/commit/bc620dabaaf13ff1dcb30af0b46a490403fb9908", "ref_desc": "fix: XSS injection with Querybook RichTextEditor (#1412) \u00b7 pinterest/querybook@bc620da \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
