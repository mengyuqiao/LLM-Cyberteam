{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23660", "Description": "The Binance Trust Wallet app for iOS in commit 3cd6e8f647fbba8b5d8844fcd144365a086b629f, git tag 0.0.4 misuses the trezor-crypto library and consequently generates mnemonic words for which the device time is the only entropy source, leading to economic losses, as exploited in the wild in July 2023. An attacker can systematically generate mnemonics for each timestamp within an applicable timeframe, and link them to specific wallet addresses in order to steal funds from those wallets.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23660", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBinance\u00bbTrust Wallet\u00bbVersion:0.0.4ForIphone Oscpe:2.3:a:binance:trust_wallet:0.0.4:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://milksad.info/posts/research-update-5/", "ref_desc": "Milk Sad: Update #5 - Digging Into New Trust Wallet ResearchExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://secbit.io/blog/en/2024/01/19/trust-wallets-fomo3d-summer-vuln/", "ref_desc": "Trust Wallet's Fomo3D Summer: Fresh Discovery of Low Entropy Flaw From 2018 - SECBIT BlogExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
