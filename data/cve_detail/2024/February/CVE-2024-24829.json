{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24829", "Description": "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Sentry\u2019s integration platform provides a way for external services to interact with Sentry. One of such integrations, the Phabricator integration (maintained by Sentry) with version <=24.1.1 contains a constrained SSRF vulnerability. An attacker could make Sentry send POST HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs (including internal IP addresses) by providing an unsanitized input to the Phabricator integration. However, the body payload is constrained to a specific format. If an attacker has access to a Sentry instance, this allows them to: 1. interact with internal network; 2. scan local/remote ports. This issue has been fixed in Sentry self-hosted release 24.1.2, and has already been mitigated on sentry.io on February 8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24829", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nSentry\u00bbSentryVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.0andbefore (<) 24.1.2cpe:2.3:a:sentry:sentry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-17  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/24.1.2", "ref_desc": "Release 24.1.2 \u00b7 getsentry/self-hosted \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-rqxh-fp9p-p98r", "ref_desc": "SSRF via Phabricator integration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/64882", "ref_desc": "fix(integrations): phabricator host validation by oioki \u00b7 Pull Request #64882 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
