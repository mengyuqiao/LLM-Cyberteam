{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24815", "Description": "CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the core HTML parsing module in versions of CKEditor4 prior to 4.24.0-lts. It may affect all editor instances that enabled full-page editing mode or enabled CDATA elements in Advanced Content Filtering configuration (defaults to `script` and `style` elements). The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malformed HTML content bypassing Advanced Content Filtering mechanism, which could result in executing JavaScript code. An attacker could abuse faulty CDATA content detection and use it to prepare an intentional attack on the editor. A fix is available in version 4.24.0-lts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24815", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCkeditor\u00bbCkeditor\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andbefore (<) 4.24.0cpe:2.3:a:ckeditor:ckeditor:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html", "ref_desc": "Introduction | CKEditor 4 DocumentationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dtd.html#property-S-cdata", "ref_desc": "Class Dtd (CKEDITOR.dtd) | CKEditor 4 API docsProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/commit/8ed1a3c93d0ae5f49f4ecff5738ab8a2972194cb", "ref_desc": "Merge commit \u00b7 ckeditor/ckeditor4@8ed1a3c \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dx9zGESkXIg8WQVPf7HmDT74Cp0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2024-009", "ref_desc": "CKEditor 4 LTS - WYSIWYG HTML editor - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CONTRIB-2024-009 | Drupal.org", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/fullpage.html", "ref_desc": "Editing Complete HTML Pages | CKEditor 4 DocumentationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/fullpage.html)", "ref_desc": "Page not found", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-fq6h-4g8v-qqvm", "ref_desc": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability caused by incorrect CDATA detection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ckeditor/ckeditor4 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
