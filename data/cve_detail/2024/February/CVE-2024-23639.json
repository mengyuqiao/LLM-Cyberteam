{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23639", "Description": "Micronaut Framework is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language. Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are \"simple\" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23639", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nObjectcomputing\u00bbMicronautVersions  before (<) 3.8.3cpe:2.3:a:objectcomputing:micronaut:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-15 External Control of System or Configuration Setting", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/15/External-Control-of-System-or-Configuration-Setting.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-664 Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/664/Improper-Control-of-a-Resource-Through-its-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests", "ref_desc": "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) - HTTP | MDNNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/security/advisories/GHSA-583g-g682-crxf", "ref_desc": "Management endpoints vulnerable to drive-by localhost attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 micronaut-projects/micronaut-core \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
