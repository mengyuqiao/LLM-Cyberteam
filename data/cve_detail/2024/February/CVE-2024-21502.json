{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21502", "Description": "Versions of the package fastecdsa before 2.3.2 are vulnerable to Use of Uninitialized Variable on the stack, via the curvemath_mul function in src/curveMath.c, due to being used and interpreted as user-defined type. Depending on the variable's actual value it could be arbitrary free(), arbitrary realloc(), null pointer dereference and other. Since the stack can be controlled by the attacker, the vulnerability could be used to corrupt allocator structure, leading to possible heap exploitation. The attacker could cause denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21502", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-457 Use of Uninitialized Variable", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/457/Use-of-Uninitialized-Variable.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/commit/57fc5689c95d649dab7ef60cc99ac64589f01e36", "ref_desc": "fix memory corruption issue \u00b7 AntonKueltz/fastecdsa@57fc568 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-FASTECDSA-6262045", "ref_desc": "Use of Uninitialized Variable in fastecdsa | CVE-2024-21502 | Snyk", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa/blob/v2.3.1/src/curveMath.c%23L210", "ref_desc": "File not found \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/keltecc/49da037072276f21b005a8337c15db26", "ref_desc": "fastecdsa vulnerability PoC \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
