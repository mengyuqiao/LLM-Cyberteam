{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25140", "Description": "A default installation of RustDesk 1.2.3 on Windows places a WDKTestCert certificate under Trusted Root Certification Authorities with Enhanced Key Usage of Code Signing (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3), valid from 2023 until 2033. This is potentially unwanted, e.g., because there is no public documentation of security measures for the private key, and arbitrary software could be signed if the private key were to be compromised. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"we do not have EV cert, so we use test cert as a workaround.\" Insertion into Trusted Root Certification Authorities was the originally intended behavior, and the UI ensured that the certificate installation step (checked by default) was visible to the user before proceeding with the product installation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25140", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRustdesk\u00bbRustdesk\u00bbVersion:1.2.3cpe:2.3:a:rustdesk:rustdesk:1.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-14  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39256493", "ref_desc": "As HN: RustDesk Installs Chinese Root Certificates | Hacker NewsIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://serverfault.com/questions/837994", "ref_desc": "ssl - Why are CA root certificates all SHA-1 signed (since SHA-1 is deprecated)? - Server FaultIssue Tracking;Technical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/discussions/6444", "ref_desc": "Strange driversigning with untrusted test-certificate and certificate that signed the RustDeskIddDriver.dll is also not the same certificate \u00b7 rustdesk/rustdesk \u00b7 Discussion #6444 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
