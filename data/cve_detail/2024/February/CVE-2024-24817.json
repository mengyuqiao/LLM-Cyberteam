{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24817", "Description": "Discourse Calendar adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic on the open-source discussion platform Discourse. Prior to version 0.4, event invitees created in topics in private categories or PMs (private messages) can be retrieved by anyone, even if they're not logged in. This problem is resolved in version 0.4 of the discourse-calendar plugin. While no known workaround is available, putting the site behind `login_required` will disallow this endpoint to be used by anonymous users, but logged in users can still get the list of invitees in the private topics.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24817", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/security/advisories/GHSA-wwq5-g5cp-c69f", "ref_desc": "User can see invitees in events created in PMs and private categories \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-calendar \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/commit/84ef46a38cf02748ecacad16c5d9c6fec12dc8da", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Hide invitees from users who are not allowed to see the eve\u2026 \u00b7 discourse/discourse-calendar@84ef46a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
