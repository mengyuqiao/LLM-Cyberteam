{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25620", "Description": "Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. When either the Helm client or SDK is used to save a chart whose name within the `Chart.yaml` file includes a relative path change, the chart would be saved outside its expected directory based on the changes in the relative path. The validation and linting did not detect the path changes in the name. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.1. Users unable to upgrade should check all charts used by Helm for path changes in their name as found in the `Chart.yaml` file. This includes dependencies.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25620", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/0d0f91d1ce277b2c8766cdc4c7aa04dbafbf2503", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-v53g-5gjp-272r \u00b7 helm/helm@0d0f91d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-v53g-5gjp-272r", "ref_desc": "Dependency management path traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
