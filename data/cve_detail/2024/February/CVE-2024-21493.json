{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21493", "Description": "All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Improper Validation of Array Index when parsing a Caddyfile. Multiple parsing functions in the affected library do not validate whether their input values are nil before attempting to access elements, which can lead to a panic (index out of range). Panics during the parsing of a configuration file may introduce ambiguity and vulnerabilities, hindering the correct interpretation and configuration of the web server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21493", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/129/Improper-Validation-of-Array-Index.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security/issues/263", "ref_desc": "Multiple Panics when Parsing Caddyfile \u00b7 Issue #263 \u00b7 greenpau/caddy-security \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/09/18/security-flaws-in-an-sso-plugin-for-caddy/", "ref_desc": "Security flaws in an SSO plugin for Caddy | Trail of Bits BlogCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/viclJFKS43mBUKoF5yafhOmvtKM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMGREENPAUCADDYSECURITY-5961078", "ref_desc": "Improper Validation of Array Index in github.com/greenpau/caddy-security | CVE-2024-21493 | Snyk", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
