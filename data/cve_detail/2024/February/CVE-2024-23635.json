{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23635", "Description": "AntiSamy is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from untrusted sources. Prior to 1.7.5, there is a potential for a mutation XSS (mXSS) vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be subject to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive must be enabled in your policy file. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result in elements in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's sanitized output. Patched in AntiSamy 1.7.5 and later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23635", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nAntisamy Project\u00bbAntisamyVersions  before (<) 1.7.5cpe:2.3:a:antisamy_project:antisamy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-10  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/security/advisories/GHSA-2mrq-w8pv-5pvq", "ref_desc": "Malicious input can provoke XSS when preserving comments \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nahsra/antisamy \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
