{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21495", "Description": "Versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security before 1.0.42 are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness due to using an insecure random number generation library which could possibly be predicted via a brute-force search. Attackers could use the potentially predictable nonce value used for authentication purposes in the OAuth flow to conduct OAuth replay attacks. In addition, insecure randomness is used while generating multifactor authentication (MFA) secrets and creating API keys in the database package.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21495", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/greenpau/go-authcrunch/commit/ecd3725baf2683eb1519bb3c81ae41085fbf7dc2", "ref_desc": "security: addresses insecure randomness finding \u00b7 greenpau/go-authcrunch@ecd3725 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMGREENPAUCADDYSECURITY-6248275", "ref_desc": "Insecure Randomness in github.com/greenpau/caddy-security | CVE-2024-21495 | Snyk", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security/issues/265", "ref_desc": "Insecure Randomness \u00b7 Issue #265 \u00b7 greenpau/caddy-security \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/09/18/security-flaws-in-an-sso-plugin-for-caddy/", "ref_desc": "Security flaws in an SSO plugin for Caddy | Trail of Bits BlogCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/viclJFKS43mBUKoF5yafhOmvtKM.html"}]}
