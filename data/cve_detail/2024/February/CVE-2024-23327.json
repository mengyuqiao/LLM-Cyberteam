{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23327", "Description": "Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. When PPv2 is enabled both on a listener and subsequent cluster, the Envoy instance will segfault when attempting to craft the upstream PPv2 header. This occurs when the downstream request has a command type of LOCAL and does not have the protocol block. This issue has been addressed in releases 1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, and 1.26.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23327", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.26.0andbefore (<) 1.26.7cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.27.0andbefore (<) 1.27.3cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.29.0andbefore (<) 1.29.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.28.0andbefore (<) 1.28.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-15  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-4h5x-x9vh-m29j", "ref_desc": "Crash in proxy protocol when command type of LOCAL \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/63895ea8e3cca9c5d3ab4c5c128ed1369969d54a", "ref_desc": "Fix crash from AWS NLB healthchecks when proxy protocol is enabled \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy@63895ea \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
