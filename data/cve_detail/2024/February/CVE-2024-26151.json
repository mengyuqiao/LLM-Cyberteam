{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26151", "Description": "The `mjml` PyPI package, found at the `FelixSchwarz/mjml-python` GitHub repo, is an unofficial Python port of MJML, a markup language created by Mailjet. All users of `FelixSchwarz/mjml-python` who insert untrusted data into mjml templates unless that data is checked in a very strict manner. User input like `&lt;script&gt;` would be rendered as `<script>` in the final HTML output. The attacker must be able to control some data which is later injected in an mjml template which is then send out as email to other users. The attacker could control contents of email messages sent through the platform. The problem has been fixed in version 0.11.0 of this library. Versions before 0.10.0 are not affected by this security issue. As a workaround, ensure that potentially untrusted user input does not contain any sequences which could be rendered as HTML.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26151", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/8d410b7a500703080bb14ed7e3d2663fe16767e6", "ref_desc": "escaped HTML entities like `&gt;` were unescaped in the final mjml ou\u2026 \u00b7 FelixSchwarz/mjml-python@8d410b7 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/releases/tag/v0.11.0", "ref_desc": "Release 0.11.0 \u00b7 FelixSchwarz/mjml-python \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/84c495da20a91640a1ca551ace17df7f3be644aa", "ref_desc": "Fix CSS child selectors; don't load remote stylesheets \u00b7 FelixSchwarz/mjml-python@84c495d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/security/advisories/GHSA-578p-fxmm-6229", "ref_desc": "Potentially untrusted input is rendered as HTML in final output \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FelixSchwarz/mjml-python \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/issues/52", "ref_desc": "Escaped HTML tags are \"un-escaped\" when rendering HTML \u00b7 Issue #52 \u00b7 FelixSchwarz/mjml-python \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
