{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24557", "Description": "Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the image is built FROM scratch. Also, changes to some instructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not cause a cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. Image build API endpoint (/build) and ImageBuild function from github.com/docker/docker/client is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default. Patches are included in 24.0.9 and 25.0.2 releases.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24557", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMobyproject\u00bbMobyVersions  before (<) 24.0.9cpe:2.3:a:mobyproject:moby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMobyproject\u00bbMobyVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.0andbefore (<) 25.0.2cpe:2.3:a:mobyproject:moby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/3e230cfdcc989dc524882f6579f9e0dac77400ae", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xw73-rw38-6vjc \u00b7 moby/moby@3e230cf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-xw73-rw38-6vjc", "ref_desc": "Classic builder cache poisoning \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 moby/moby \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
