{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25629", "Description": "c-ares is a C library for asynchronous DNS requests. `ares__read_line()` is used to parse local configuration files such as `/etc/resolv.conf`, `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, the `HOSTALIASES` file, and if using a c-ares version prior to 1.27.0, the `/etc/hosts` file. If any of these configuration files has an embedded `NULL` character as the first character in a new line, it can lead to attempting to read memory prior to the start of the given buffer which may result in a crash. This issue is fixed in c-ares 1.27.0. No known workarounds exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25629", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-127 Buffer Under-read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/127/Buffer-Under-read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GX37LFPFQ3T6FFMMFYQTEGIQXXN7F27U/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: c-ares-1.28.1-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/commit/a804c04ddc8245fc8adf0e92368709639125e183", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-mg26-v6qh-x48q \u00b7 c-ares/c-ares@a804c04 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/security/advisories/GHSA-mg26-v6qh-x48q", "ref_desc": "Out of bounds read in ares__read_line() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 c-ares/c-ares \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2P76QYINQNPEHUTEEDOUYIRZ2X6UVZ5K/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: c-ares-1.28.1-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CSCMTSPDIE2UHU34TIXQQHZ6JTE3Y3VF/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: c-ares-1.28.1-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
