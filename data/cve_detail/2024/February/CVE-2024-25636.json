{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25636", "Description": "Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25636", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-qqrm-9grj-6v32", "ref_desc": "Lack of media type verification of Activity Streams objects allows impersonation and takeover of remote accounts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/2024.2.0-beta.10/packages/backend/src/core/activitypub/ApResolverService.ts#L69-L119", "ref_desc": "misskey/packages/backend/src/core/activitypub/ApResolverService.ts at 2024.2.0-beta.10 \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/2024.2.0-beta.10/packages/backend/src/core/activitypub/models/ApNoteService.ts#L112-L308", "ref_desc": "misskey/packages/backend/src/core/activitypub/models/ApNoteService.ts at 2024.2.0-beta.10 \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/2024.2.0-beta.10/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints/ap/show.ts#L125-L143", "ref_desc": "misskey/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints/ap/show.ts at 2024.2.0-beta.10 \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/9a70ce8f5ea9df00001894809f5ce7bc69b14c8a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qqrm-9grj-6v32 \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey@9a70ce8 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
