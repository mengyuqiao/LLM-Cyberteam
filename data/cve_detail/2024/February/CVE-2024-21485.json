{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21485", "Description": "Versions of the package dash-core-components before 2.13.0; versions of the package dash-core-components before 2.0.0; versions of the package dash before 2.15.0; versions of the package dash-html-components before 2.0.0; versions of the package dash-html-components before 2.0.16 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when the href of the a tag is controlled by an adversary. An authenticated attacker who stores a view that exploits this vulnerability could steal the data that's visible to another user who opens that view - not just the data already included on the page, but they could also, in theory, make additional requests and access other data accessible to this user. In some cases, they could also steal the access tokens of that user, which would allow the attacker to act as that user, including viewing other apps and resources hosted on the same server.\r\r**Note:**\r\rThis is only exploitable in Dash apps that include some mechanism to store user input to be reloaded by a different user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21485", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPlotly\u00bbDashVersions  before (<) 2.13.0cpe:2.3:a:plotly:dash:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPlotly\u00bbDashVersions  from including (>=) 2.14.0andbefore (<) 2.15.0cpe:2.3:a:plotly:dash:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-10  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-DASHCORECOMPONENTS-6226334", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in dash-core-components | CVE-2024-21485 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DASHHTMLCOMPONENTS-6226337", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in dash-html-components | CVE-2024-21485 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-DASHHTMLCOMPONENTS-6226336", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in dash-html-components | CVE-2024-21485 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/2732", "ref_desc": "Sanitize html props with xss vulnerability. by T4rk1n \u00b7 Pull Request #2732 \u00b7 plotly/dash \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/plotly/dash/commit/9920073c9a8619ae8f90fcec1924f2f3a4332a8c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2732 from plotly/fix/xss-props \u00b7 plotly/dash@9920073 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/2729", "ref_desc": "Validate url to prevent XSS attacks \u00b7 Issue #2729 \u00b7 plotly/dash \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-DASH-6226335", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in dash | CVE-2024-21485 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/plotly/dash/releases/tag/v2.15.0", "ref_desc": "Release Dash v2.15.0 \u00b7 plotly/dash \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DASHCORECOMPONENTS-6183084", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in dash-core-components | CVE-2024-21485 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
