{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26150", "Description": "`@backstage/backend-common` is a common functionality library for backends for Backstage, an open platform for building developer portals. In `@backstage/backend-common` prior to versions 0.21.1, 0.20.2, and 0.19.10, paths checks with the `resolveSafeChildPath` utility were not exhaustive enough, leading to risk of path traversal vulnerabilities if symlinks can be injected by attackers. This issue is patched in `@backstage/backend-common` versions 0.21.1, 0.20.2, and 0.19.10.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26150", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/edf65d7d31e027599c2415f597d085ee84807871", "ref_desc": "fix: make sure to construct the target from the resolved base path too \u00b7 backstage/backstage@edf65d7 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/1ad2b1b61ebb430051f7d804b0cc7ebfe7922b6f", "ref_desc": "chore: return the original input path, and add a test \u00b7 backstage/backstage@1ad2b1b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/78f892b3a84d63de2ba167928f171154c447b717", "ref_desc": "fix: resolve the actual paths for base and target \u00b7 backstage/backstage@78f892b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-2fc9-xpp8-2g9h", "ref_desc": "Path traversal through symlinks for @backstage/backend-common \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
