{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24814", "Description": "mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified\u2122 authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24814", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:39cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:39:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenidc\u00bbMod Auth OpenidcVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.4.15.1cpe:2.3:a:openidc:mod_auth_openidc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00004.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3751-1] libapache2-mod-auth-openidc security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T7DKVEVREYAI4F46CQAVOTPL75WLOZOE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: mod_auth_openidc-2.4.15.3-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-hxr6-w4gc-7vvv", "ref_desc": "DoS when using `OIDCSessionType client-cookie` and manipulating cookies \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/4022c12f314bd89d127d1be008b1a80a08e1203d", "ref_desc": "release 2.4.15.2: fix DoS CVE-2024-24814 \u00b7 OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc@4022c12 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
