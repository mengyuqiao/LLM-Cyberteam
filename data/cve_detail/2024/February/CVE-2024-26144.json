{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26144", "Description": "Rails is a web-application framework. Starting with version 5.2.0, there is a possible sensitive session information leak in Active Storage. By default, Active Storage sends a Set-Cookie header along with the user's session cookie when serving blobs. It also sets Cache-Control to public. Certain proxies may cache the Set-Cookie, leading to an information leak. The vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.8.1 and 6.1.7.7.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26144", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/possible-sensitive-session-information-leak-in-active-storage/84945", "ref_desc": "Possible Sensitive Session Information Leak in Active Storage - Security Announcements - Ruby on Rails Discussions", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0013/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-26144 Ruby on Rails Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/activestorage/CVE-2024-26144.yml", "ref_desc": "ruby-advisory-db/gems/activestorage/CVE-2024-26144.yml at master \u00b7 rubysec/ruby-advisory-db \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-8h22-8cf7-hq6g", "ref_desc": "Possible Sensitive Session Information Leak in Active Storage \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rails/rails \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/723f54566023e91060a67b03353e7c03e7436433", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #48869 from brunoprietog/disable-session-active-st\u2026 \u00b7 rails/rails@723f545 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/78fe149509fac5b05e54187aaaef216fbb5fd0d3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #48869 from brunoprietog/disable-session-active-st\u2026 \u00b7 rails/rails@78fe149 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
