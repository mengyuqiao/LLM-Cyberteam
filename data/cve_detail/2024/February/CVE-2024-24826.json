{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24826", "Description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. In most cases this out of bounds read will result in a crash. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24826", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nExiv2\u00bbExiv2\u00bbVersion:0.28.0cpe:2.3:a:exiv2:exiv2:0.28.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nExiv2\u00bbExiv2\u00bbVersion:0.28.1cpe:2.3:a:exiv2:exiv2:0.28.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/2337", "ref_desc": "Restore some video capabilities by restoring `quicktimevideo.cpp` by hassec \u00b7 Pull Request #2337 \u00b7 Exiv2/exiv2 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6qwrILPNZ297Vo8mBTgRKA4vJ_Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-g9xm-7538-mq8w", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read in QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Exiv2/exiv2 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
