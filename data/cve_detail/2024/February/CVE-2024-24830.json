{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24830", "Description": "OpenObserve is a observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces, analytics, designed to work at petabyte scale. A vulnerability has been identified in the \"/api/{org_id}/users\" endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated regular user ('member') to add new users with elevated privileges, including the 'root' role, to an organization. This issue circumvents the intended security controls for role assignments. The vulnerability resides in the user creation process, where the payload does not validate the user roles. A regular user can manipulate the payload to assign root-level privileges. This vulnerability leads to Unauthorized Privilege Escalation and significantly compromises the application's role-based access control system. It allows unauthorized control over application resources and poses a risk to data security. All users, particularly those in administrative roles, are impacted. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24830", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOpenobserve\u00bbOpenobserveVersions  before (<) 0.8.0cpe:2.3:a:openobserve:openobserve:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-272 Least Privilege Violation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/272/Least-Privilege-Violation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/security/advisories/GHSA-hfxx-g56f-8h5v", "ref_desc": "OpenObserve Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Users API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openobserve/openobserve \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
