{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26130", "Description": "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. Starting in version 38.0.0 and prior to version 42.0.4, if `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates` is called with both a certificate whose public key did not match the provided private key and an `encryption_algorithm` with `hmac_hash` set (via `PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`, then a NULL pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process. This has been resolved in version 42.0.4, the first version in which a `ValueError` is properly raised.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26130", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/10423", "ref_desc": "Fixes #10422 -- don't crash when a PKCS#12 key and cert don't match by alex \u00b7 Pull Request #10423 \u00b7 pyca/cryptography \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/security/advisories/GHSA-6vqw-3v5j-54x4", "ref_desc": "NULL pointer deference with pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates when called with a non-matching certificate and private key and an hmac_hash override \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pyca/cryptography \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/97d231672763cdb5959a3b191e692a362f1b9e55", "ref_desc": "Fixes #10422 -- don't crash when a PKCS#12 key and cert don't match (\u2026 \u00b7 pyca/cryptography@97d2316 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
