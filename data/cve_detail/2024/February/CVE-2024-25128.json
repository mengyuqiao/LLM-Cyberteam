{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25128", "Description": "Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of Flask. When Flask-AppBuilder is set to AUTH_TYPE AUTH_OID, it allows an attacker to forge an HTTP request, that could deceive the backend into using any requested OpenID service. This vulnerability could grant an attacker unauthorised privilege access if a custom OpenID service is deployed by the attacker and accessible by the backend. This vulnerability is only exploitable when the application is using the OpenID 2.0 authorization protocol. Upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 4.3.11 to fix the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25128", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/security/advisories/GHSA-j2pw-vp55-fqqj", "ref_desc": "Incorrect authentication when using auth type OpenID \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/commit/6336456d83f8f111c842b2b53d1e89627f2502c8", "ref_desc": "fix: openID provider validation flow (#2186) \u00b7 dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder@6336456 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
