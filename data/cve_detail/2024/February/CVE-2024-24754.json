{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24754", "Description": "Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and its content added in the `$files` or `$parsedBody` arrays. The conversion process produces a different output compared to the one of plain PHP when keys ending with and open square bracket ([) are used. Based on the application logic the difference in the body parsing might lead to vulnerabilities and/or undefined behaviors. This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24754", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMnapoli\u00bbBrefVersions  before (<) 2.1.13cpe:2.3:a:mnapoli:bref:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-24  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/brefphp/bref/security/advisories/GHSA-82vx-mm6r-gg8w", "ref_desc": "Body Parsing Inconsistency in Event-Driven Functions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 brefphp/bref \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/brefphp/bref/commit/c77d9f5abf021f29fa96b5720b7b84adbd199092", "ref_desc": "Cleanup uploaded files for PSR-15 handlers \u00b7 brefphp/bref@c77d9f5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
