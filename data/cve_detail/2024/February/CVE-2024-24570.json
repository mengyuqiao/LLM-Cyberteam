{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24570", "Description": "Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. HTML files crafted to look like jpg files are able to be uploaded, allowing for XSS. This affects the front-end forms with asset fields without any mime type validation, asset fields in the control panel, and asset browser in the control panel. Additionally, if the XSS is crafted in a specific way, the \"copy password reset link\" feature may be exploited to gain access to a user's password reset token and gain access to their account. The authorized user is required to execute the XSS in order for the vulnerability to occur. In versions 4.46.0 and 3.4.17, the XSS vulnerability has been patched, and the copy password reset link functionality has been disabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24570", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nStatamic\u00bbStatamicVersions  before (<) 3.4.17cpe:2.3:a:statamic:statamic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nStatamic\u00bbStatamicVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.46.0cpe:2.3:a:statamic:statamic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Feb/17", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: SEC Consult SA-20240212-0 :: Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in Statamic CMS", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/statamic/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-vqxq-hvxw-9mv9", "ref_desc": "Account takeover via XSS and password reset link \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 statamic/cms \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/177133/Statamic-CMS-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "Statamic CMS Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
