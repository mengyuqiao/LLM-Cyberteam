{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-1892", "Description": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the XMLFeedSpider class of the scrapy/scrapy project, specifically in the parsing of XML content. By crafting malicious XML content that exploits inefficient regular expression complexity used in the parsing process, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability allows for the system to hang and consume significant resources, potentially rendering services that utilize Scrapy for XML processing unresponsive.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1892", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://huntr.com/bounties/271f94f2-1e05-4616-ac43-41752389e26b", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service when parsing downloaded XML content in XMLFeedSpider vulnerability found in scrapy", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/commit/479619b340f197a8f24c5db45bc068fb8755f2c5", "ref_desc": "Merge branch '2.11-redos' into 2.11 \u00b7 scrapy/scrapy@479619b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
