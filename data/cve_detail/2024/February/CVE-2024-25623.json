{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25623", "Description": "Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Prior to versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19, when fetching remote statuses, Mastodon doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Mastodon server fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the attacker to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as the ActivityPub actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19 contain a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25623", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-jhrq-qvrm-qr36", "ref_desc": "Lack of media type verification of Activity Streams objects allows impersonation of remote accounts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mastodon/mastodon \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/9fee5e852669e26f970e278021302e1a203fc022", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jhrq-qvrm-qr36 \u00b7 mastodon/mastodon@9fee5e8 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
