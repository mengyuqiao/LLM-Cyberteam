{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26147", "Description": "Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Versions prior to 3.14.2 contain an uninitialized variable vulnerability when Helm parses index and plugin yaml files missing expected content. When either an `index.yaml` file or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were missing all metadata a panic would occur in Helm. In the Helm SDK, this is found when using the `LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile` functions in the `repo` package or the `LoadDir` function in the `plugin` package. For the Helm client this impacts functions around adding a repository and all Helm functions if a malicious plugin is added as Helm inspects all known plugins on each invocation. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a malicious plugin has been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic, the malicious plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If using Helm SDK versions prior to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use `recover` to catch the panic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26147", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-457 Use of Uninitialized Variable", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/457/Use-of-Uninitialized-Variable.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/bb4cc9125503a923afb7988f3eb478722a8580af", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-r53h-jv2g-vpx6 \u00b7 helm/helm@bb4cc91 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-r53h-jv2g-vpx6", "ref_desc": "Missing YAML Content Leads To Panic \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
