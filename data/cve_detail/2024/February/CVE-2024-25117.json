{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25117", "Description": "php-svg-lib is a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file parsing/rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.2, php-svg-lib fails to validate that font-family doesn't contain a PHAR url, which might leads to RCE on PHP < 8.0, and doesn't validate if external references are allowed. This might leads to bypass of restrictions or RCE on projects that are using it, if they do not strictly revalidate the fontName that is passed by php-svg-lib. The `Style::fromAttributes(`), or the `Style::parseCssStyle()` should check the content of the `font-family` and prevents it to use a PHAR url, to avoid passing an invalid and dangerous `fontName` value to other libraries. The same check as done in the `Style::fromStyleSheets` might be reused. Libraries using this library as a dependency might be vulnerable to some bypass of restrictions, or even remote code execution, if they do not double check the value of the `fontName` that is passed by php-svg-lib. Version 0.5.2 contains a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25117", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/73/External-Control-of-File-Name-or-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/commit/8ffcc41bbde39f09f94b9760768086f12bbdce42", "ref_desc": "Update resource validation logic \u00b7 dompdf/php-svg-lib@8ffcc41 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/security/advisories/GHSA-f3qr-qr4x-j273", "ref_desc": "Lack of path validation on font through SVG inline styles \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dompdf/php-svg-lib \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/commit/732faa9fb4309221e2bd9b2fda5de44f947133aa", "ref_desc": "Remove invalid condition around image href validation \u00b7 dompdf/php-svg-lib@732faa9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
