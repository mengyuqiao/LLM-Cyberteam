{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23831", "Description": "LedgerSMB is a free web-based double-entry accounting system. When a LedgerSMB database administrator has an active session in /setup.pl, an attacker can trick the admin into clicking on a link which automatically submits a request to setup.pl without the admin's consent.  This request can be used to create a new user account with full application (/login.pl) privileges, leading to privilege escalation.  The vulnerability is patched in versions 1.10.30 and 1.11.9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23831", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nLedgersmb\u00bbLedgersmbVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.9cpe:2.3:a:ledgersmb:ledgersmb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLedgersmb\u00bbLedgersmbVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0andbefore (<) 1.10.30cpe:2.3:a:ledgersmb:ledgersmb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-10  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/security/advisories/GHSA-98ff-f638-qxjm", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation through CSRF attack on 'setup.pl' \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ledgersmb/LedgerSMB \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/commit/8c2ae5be68a782d62cb9c0e17c0127bf30ef4165", "ref_desc": "Fix missing CSRF mitigation \u00b7 ledgersmb/LedgerSMB@8c2ae5b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
