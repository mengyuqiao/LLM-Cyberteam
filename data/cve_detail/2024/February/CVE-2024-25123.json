{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25123", "Description": "MSS (Mission Support System) is an open source package designed for planning atmospheric research flights. In file: `index.py`, there is a method that is vulnerable to path manipulation attack. By modifying file paths, an attacker can acquire sensitive information from different resources. The `filename` variable is joined with other variables to form a file path in `_file`. However, `filename` is a route parameter that can capture path type values i.e. values including slashes (\\). So it is possible for an attacker to manipulate the file being read by assigning a value containing ../ to `filename` and so the attacker may be able to gain access to other files on the host filesystem. This issue has been addressed in MSS version 8.3.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25123", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Open-MSS/MSS/commit/f23033729ee930b97f8bdbd07df0174311c9b658", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-pf2h-qjcr-qvq2 \u00b7 Open-MSS/MSS@f230337 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Open-MSS/MSS/security/advisories/GHSA-pf2h-qjcr-qvq2", "ref_desc": "Potential Path Manipulation in file mslib/index.py \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Open-MSS/MSS \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
