{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-20290", "Description": "A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check for end-of-string values during scanning, which may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software and consuming available system resources.\r\n\r For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog .", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-20290", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSecure Endpoint\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 7.5.17cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Endpoint\u00bbForWindowsVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.1.21160andbefore (<) 8.2.3.30119cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Endpoint Private CloudVersions  before (<) 3.8.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_endpoint_private_cloud:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:39cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:39:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-02-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-126 Buffer Over-read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/126/Buffer-Over-read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5FXZYVDNV66RNMNVJOHAJAYRZV4U64CQ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: clamav-1.0.5-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6MUDUPAHAAV6FPB2C2QIQCFJ4SHYBOTY/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: clamav-1.0.5-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-clamav-hDffu6t", "ref_desc": "ClamAV OLE2 File Format Parsing Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
