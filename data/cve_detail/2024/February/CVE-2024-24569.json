{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24569", "Description": "The Pixee Java Code Security Toolkit is a set of security APIs meant to help secure Java code. `ZipSecurity#isBelowCurrentDirectory` is vulnerable to a partial-path traversal bypass. To be vulnerable to the bypass, the application must use toolkit version <=1.1.1, use ZipSecurity as a guard against path traversal, and have an exploit path. Although the control still protects attackers from escaping the application path into higher level directories (e.g., /etc/), it will allow \"escaping\" into sibling paths. For example, if your running path is /my/app/path you an attacker could navigate into /my/app/path-something-else. This vulnerability is patched in 1.1.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24569", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nPixee\u00bbJava Code Security ToolkitVersions  before (<) 1.1.2cpe:2.3:a:pixee:java_code_security_toolkit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/commit/b885b03c9cfae53d62d239037f9654d973dd54d9", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qh4g-4m4w-jgv2 \u00b7 pixee/java-security-toolkit@b885b03 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/security/advisories/GHSA-qh4g-4m4w-jgv2", "ref_desc": "`ZipSecurity` is vulnerable to partial-path traversal vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pixee/java-security-toolkit \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/blob/7c8e93e6fb2420fb6003c54a741e267c4f883bab/src/main/java/io/github/pixee/security/ZipSecurity.java#L82-L87", "ref_desc": "java-security-toolkit/src/main/java/io/github/pixee/security/ZipSecurity.java at 7c8e93e6fb2420fb6003c54a741e267c4f883bab \u00b7 pixee/java-security-toolkit \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
