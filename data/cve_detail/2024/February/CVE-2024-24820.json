{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24820", "Description": "Icinga Director is a tool designed to make Icinga 2 configuration handling easy. Not any of Icinga Director's configuration forms used to manipulate the monitoring environment are protected against cross site request forgery (CSRF). It enables attackers to perform changes in the monitoring environment managed by Icinga Director without the awareness of the victim. Users of the map module in version 1.x, should immediately upgrade to v2.0. The mentioned XSS vulnerabilities in Icinga Web are already fixed as well and upgrades to the most recent release of the 2.9, 2.10 or 2.11 branch must be performed if not done yet. Any later major release is also suitable. Icinga Director will receive minor updates to the 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 branches to remedy this issue. Upgrade immediately to a patched release. If that is not feasible, disable the director module for the time being.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24820", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.8.2cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.0andbefore (<) 1.9.2cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.3cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.3cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-17  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/", "ref_desc": "Firefox Rolls Out Total Cookie Protection By DefaultPress/Media Coverage", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nbuchwitz/icingaweb2-module-map/pull/86", "ref_desc": "Fix XSS Vulnerability by jason0x90 \u00b7 Pull Request #86 \u00b7 nbuchwitz/icingaweb2-module-map \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/issues?q=is%3Aissue++is%3Aclosed+4979+4960+4947", "ref_desc": "Issues \u00b7 Icinga/icingaweb2 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.apple.com/en-is/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0", "ref_desc": "Manage cookies and website data in Safari on Mac - Apple Support (IS)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director/security/advisories/GHSA-3mwp-5p5v-j6q3", "ref_desc": "Configuration is susceptible to CSRF \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Icinga/icingaweb2-module-director \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site/", "ref_desc": "SameSite UpdatesIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
