{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24559", "Description": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. There is an error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated. The vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand (that is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code). `sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key` was found so the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated `IR`. This issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper code so the impact is low. At the time of publication there is no patch available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24559", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyper\u00bbForPythonVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.3.10cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/c150fc49ee9375a930d177044559b83cb95f7963/vyper/ir/compile_ir.py#L585-L586", "ref_desc": "vyper/vyper/ir/compile_ir.py at c150fc49ee9375a930d177044559b83cb95f7963 \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-6845-xw22-ffxv", "ref_desc": "sha3 codegen bug \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
