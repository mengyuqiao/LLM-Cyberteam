{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-55451", "Description": "A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in authenticated SVG file upload and viewing functionality in UJCMS 9.6.3. The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of embedded attributes in uploaded SVG files. When a maliciously crafted SVG file is viewed by other backend users, it allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other backend users' browsers, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive tokens.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-55451", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dromara/ujcms", "ref_desc": "GitHub - dromara/ujcms: Java\u5f00\u6e90\u7f51\u7ad9\u5185\u5bb9\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf(java cms)\u3002\u4f7f\u7528SpringBoot\u3001MyBatis\u3001Spring Security\u3001Lucene\u3001FreeMarker\u3001TypeScript\u3001Vue3\u3001ElementPlus\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u3002CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LQrDS-KMDjY_0Kkh3SGPf7bQK_k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cydtseng/Vulnerability-Research/blob/main/ujcms/StoredXSS-SVGUpload.md", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability-Research/ujcms/StoredXSS-SVGUpload.md at main \u00b7 cydtseng/Vulnerability-Research \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
