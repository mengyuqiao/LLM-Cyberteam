{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56334", "Description": "systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In affected versions SSIDs are not sanitized when before they are passed as a parameter to cmd.exe in the `getWindowsIEEE8021x` function. This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. This vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation. This issue has been addressed in version 5.23.7 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56334", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/security/advisories/GHSA-cvv5-9h9w-qp2m", "ref_desc": "Command injection vulnerability in getWindowsIEEE8021x (SSID) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sebhildebrandt/systeminformation \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/commit/f7af0a67b78e7894335a6cad510566a25e06ae41", "ref_desc": "networkInterfaces() sanitizing SSID names (windows) \u00b7 sebhildebrandt/systeminformation@f7af0a6 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
