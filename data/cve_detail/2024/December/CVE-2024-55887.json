{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-55887", "Description": "Ucum-java is a FHIR Java library providing UCUM Services. In versions prior to 1.0.9, XML parsing performed by the UcumEssenceService is vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where ucum is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. Release 1.0.9 of Ucum-java fixes this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that the source xml for instantiating UcumEssenceService is trusted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-55887", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FHIR/Ucum-java/security/advisories/GHSA-w9j7-phm3-f97j", "ref_desc": "XXE vulnerability in XML parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FHIR/Ucum-java \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
