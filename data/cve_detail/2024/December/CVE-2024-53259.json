{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53259", "Description": "quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO, the kernel would then return a \"message too large\" error on sendmsg, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53259", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/ca31dd355cbe5fc6c5807992d9d1149c66c96a50", "ref_desc": "use IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE instead of IP_PMTUDISC_DO on Linux (#4729) \u00b7 quic-go/quic-go@ca31dd3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/4729", "ref_desc": "use IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE instead of IP_PMTUDISC_DO on Linux by marten-seemann \u00b7 Pull Request #4729 \u00b7 quic-go/quic-go \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-px8v-pp82-rcvr", "ref_desc": "ICMP Packet Too Large Injection Attack on Linux \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 quic-go/quic-go \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/releases/tag/v0.48.2", "ref_desc": "Release v0.48.2 \u00b7 quic-go/quic-go \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
