{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56201", "Description": "Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, a bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the template author can also choose the template filename. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56201", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-150 Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/150/Improper-Neutralization-of-Escape-Meta-or-Control-Sequence.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1792", "ref_desc": "f-string sytax error when importing macro in a template which filename is also a template \u00b7 Issue #1792 \u00b7 pallets/jinja \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/767b23617628419ae3709ccfb02f9602ae9fe51f", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases/tag/3.1.5", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jU4GvdeKEF1IcY92Z3MGmAuc_UY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
