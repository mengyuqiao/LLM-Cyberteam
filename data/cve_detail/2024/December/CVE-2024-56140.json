{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56140", "Description": "Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. In affected versions a bug in Astro\u2019s CSRF-protection middleware allows requests to bypass CSRF checks. When the `security.checkOrigin` configuration option is set to `true`, Astro middleware will perform a CSRF check. However, a vulnerability exists that can bypass this security. A semicolon-delimited parameter is allowed after the type in `Content-Type`. Web browsers will treat a `Content-Type` such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; abc` as a `simple request` and will not perform preflight validation. In this case, CSRF is not blocked as expected. Additionally, the `Content-Type` header is not required for a request. This issue has been addressed in version 4.16.17 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56140", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/e7d14c374b9d45e27089994a4eb72186d05514de", "ref_desc": "fix: `checkOrigin` headers check (#12632) \u00b7 withastro/astro@e7d14c3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/6031962ab5f56457de986eb82bd24807e926ba1b/packages/astro/src/core/app/middlewares.ts", "ref_desc": "astro/packages/astro/src/core/app/middlewares.ts at 6031962ab5f56457de986eb82bd24807e926ba1b \u00b7 withastro/astro \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/withastro/astro/security/advisories/GHSA-c4pw-33h3-35xw", "ref_desc": "Bypass CSRF Middleware (security.checkOrigin) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 withastro/astro \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests", "ref_desc": "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) - HTTP | MDNCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JxIn8O0oHvRfbfellwSf5umDi5Y.html"}]}
