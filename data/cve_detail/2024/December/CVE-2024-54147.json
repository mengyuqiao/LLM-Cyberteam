{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-54147", "Description": "Altair is a GraphQL client for all platforms. Prior to version 8.0.5, Altair GraphQL Client's desktop app does not validate HTTPS certificates allowing a man-in-the-middle to intercept all requests. Any Altair users on untrusted networks (eg. public wifi, malicious DNS servers) may have all GraphQL request and response headers and bodies fully compromised including authorization tokens. The attack also allows obtaining full access to any signed-in Altair GraphQL Cloud account and replacing payment checkout pages with a malicious website. Version 8.0.5 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54147", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/altair-graphql/altair/security/advisories/GHSA-8v9h-hxp5-9jcx", "ref_desc": "Altair GraphQL Client's desktop app does not validate HTTPS certificates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 altair-graphql/altair \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/altair-graphql/altair/blob/004f645d1cae032787fccf7166dc193b775e9660/packages/altair-electron/src/app/index.ts#L162-L170", "ref_desc": "altair/packages/altair-electron/src/app/index.ts at 004f645d1cae032787fccf7166dc193b775e9660 \u00b7 altair-graphql/altair \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
