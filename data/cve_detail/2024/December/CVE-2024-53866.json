{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53866", "Description": "The package manager pnpm prior to version 9.15.0 seems to mishandle overrides and global cache: Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache; npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces; and installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation). This can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B. Users generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it). Here, that expectation is broken. Global state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs. Version 9.15.0 fixes the issue. As a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53866", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/commit/11afcddea48f25ed5117a87dc1780a55222b9743", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 pnpm/pnpm@11afcdd \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/security/advisories/GHSA-vm32-9rqf-rh3r", "ref_desc": "No-script global cache poisoning via overrides / `ignore-scripts` evasion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pnpm/pnpm \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
