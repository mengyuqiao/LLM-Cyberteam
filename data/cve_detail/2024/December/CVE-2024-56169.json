{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56169", "Description": "A validation integrity issue was discovered in Fort through 1.6.4 before 2.0.0. RPKI Relying Parties (such as Fort) are supposed to maintain a backup cache of the remote RPKI data. This can be employed as a fallback in case a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files. However, the product currently uses its cache merely as a bandwidth saving tool (because fetching is performed through deltas). If a fetch fails midway or yields incorrect files, there is no viable fallback. This leads to incomplete route origin validation data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56169", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/CVE.html", "ref_desc": "CVE | FORT Validator - RPKI Relying PartyCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4jQyPxhwWqQo5omPvRu_tfso44o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/82", "ref_desc": "Reach 100% RFC 9286 compliance \u00b7 Issue #82 \u00b7 NICMx/FORT-validator \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
