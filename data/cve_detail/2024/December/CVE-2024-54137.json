{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-54137", "Description": "liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms. A correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism. Due to an indexing error, part of the secret key is incorrectly treated as non-secret data. This results in an incorrect shared secret value being returned when the decapsulation function is called with a malformed ciphertext. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.12.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54137", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/cce1bfde4e52c524b087b9687020d283fbde0f24", "ref_desc": "Run copy_from_upstream.py \u00b7 open-quantum-safe/liboqs@cce1bfd \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7", "ref_desc": "Correctness error in HQC decapsulation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-quantum-safe/liboqs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
