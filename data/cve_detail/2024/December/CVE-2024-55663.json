{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-55663", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 13.10.5 and 14.3-rc-1, in `getdocument.vm`; the ordering of the returned documents is defined from an unsanitized request parameter (request.sort) and can allow any user to inject HQL. Depending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries. This has been patched in 13.10.5 and 14.3-rc-1. There is no known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-55663", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/673076e2e8b88a36cdeaf7007843aa9ca1a068a0", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-17568: clean sort parameter value \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@673076e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17568", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-17568] HQL injection in getdocuments.vm with sort parameter - XWiki.org JIRA", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-wh34-m772-5398", "ref_desc": "SQL injection in getdocuments.vm with sort parameter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/T9BiGBJB_MTlUUkOvpQB8AohnSI.html"}]}
