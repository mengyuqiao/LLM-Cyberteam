{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56433", "Description": "shadow-utils (aka shadow) 4.4 through 4.17.0 establishes a default /etc/subuid behavior (e.g., uid 100000 through 165535 for the first user account) that can realistically conflict with the uids of users defined on locally administered networks, potentially leading to account takeover, e.g., by leveraging newuidmap for access to an NFS home directory (or same-host resources in the case of remote logins by these local network users). NOTE: it may also be argued that system administrators should not have assigned uids, within local networks, that are within the range that can occur in /etc/subuid.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56433", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1188/Initialization-of-a-Resource-with-an-Insecure-Default.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/blob/e2512d5741d4a44bdd81a8c2d0029b6222728cf0/etc/login.defs#L238-L241", "ref_desc": "shadow/etc/login.defs at e2512d5741d4a44bdd81a8c2d0029b6222728cf0 \u00b7 shadow-maint/shadow \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/issues/1157", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/releases/tag/4.4", "ref_desc": "Release Shadow 4.4 \u00b7 shadow-maint/shadow \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
