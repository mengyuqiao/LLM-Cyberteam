{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56326", "Description": "Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56326", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1336 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1336/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-Used-in-a-Templa.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases/tag/3.1.5", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jU4GvdeKEF1IcY92Z3MGmAuc_UY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/48b0687e05a5466a91cd5812d604fa37ad0943b4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
