{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53270", "Description": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In affected versions `sendOverloadError` is going to assume the active request exists when `envoy.load_shed_points.http1_server_abort_dispatch` is configured. If `active_request` is nullptr, only onMessageBeginImpl() is called. However, the `onMessageBeginImpl` will directly return ok status if the stream is already reset leading to the nullptr reference. The downstream reset can actually happen during the H/2 upstream reset. As a result envoy may crash. This issue has been addressed in releases 1.32.3, 1.31.5, 1.30.9, and 1.29.12. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable `http1_server_abort_dispatch` load shed point and/or use a high threshold.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53270", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/37743/commits/6cf8afda956ba67c9afad185b962325a5242ef02", "ref_desc": "[IMPORTANT] CVE patches by phlax \u00b7 Pull Request #37743 \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-q9qv-8j52-77p3", "ref_desc": "HTTP/1: sending overload crashes when the request is reset beforehand \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
