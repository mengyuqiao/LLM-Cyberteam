{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56509", "Description": "changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection, website watcher, restock monitor and notification service. Improper input validation in the application can allow attackers to perform local file read (LFR) or path traversal attacks. These vulnerabilities occur when user input is used to construct file paths without adequate sanitization or validation. For example, using file:../../../etc/passwd or file: ///etc/passwd can bypass weak validations and allow unauthorized access to sensitive files. Even though this has been addressed in previous patch, it is still insufficient. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.05.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56509", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Bypass", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/commit/f7e9846c9b40a229813d19cdb66bf60fbe5e6a2a", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-56509 - Stricter file protocol checking pre-check ( Improper\u2026 \u00b7 dgtlmoon/changedetection.io@f7e9846 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-j5vv-6wjg-cfr8", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
