{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-54143", "Description": "openwrt/asu is an image on demand server for OpenWrt based distributions. The request hashing mechanism truncates SHA-256 hashes to only 12 characters. This significantly reduces entropy, making it feasible for an attacker to generate collisions. By exploiting this, a previously built malicious image can be served in place of a legitimate one, allowing the attacker to \"poison\" the artifact cache and deliver compromised images to unsuspecting users. This can be combined with other attacks, such as a command injection in Imagebuilder that allows malicious users to inject arbitrary commands into the build process, resulting in the production of malicious firmware images signed with the legitimate build key. This has been patched with 920c8a1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54143", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-328 Use of Weak Hash", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/328/Use-of-Weak-Hash.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openwrt/asu/security/advisories/GHSA-r3gq-96h6-3v7q", "ref_desc": "Build artifact poisoning via truncated SHA-256 hash and command injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openwrt/asu \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openwrt/asu/commit/920c8a13d97b4d4095f0d939cf0aaae777e0f87e", "ref_desc": "chore: cleanups and OpenWrt One as default \u00b7 openwrt/asu@920c8a1 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
