{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56695", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'\n\nThe `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large\n`cu_occupancy` array as a local variable, which could lead to stack\noverflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static\narray allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`,\nthereby reducing the stack size.\n\nThis change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space,  in\nscenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory is\nfreed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memory\nleaks.\n\nFixes the below with gcc W=1:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function \u2018kfd_get_cu_occupancy\u2019:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]\n  322 | }\n      | ^", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56695", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/922f0e00017b09d9d47e3efac008c8b20ed546a0", "ref_desc": "drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()' - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6d9f07196389f35a3afebcf1a12c1425725caddd", "ref_desc": "drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()' - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
