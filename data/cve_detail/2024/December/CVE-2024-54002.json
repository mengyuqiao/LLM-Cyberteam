{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-54002", "Description": "Dependency-Track is a Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Performing a login request against the /api/v1/user/login endpoint with a username that exist in the system takes significantly longer than performing the same action with a username that is not known by the system. The observable difference in request duration can be leveraged by actors to enumerate valid names of managed users. LDAP and OpenID Connect users are not affected. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54002", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-9w3m-hm36-w32w", "ref_desc": "Enumeration of managed users via /api/v1/user/login endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DependencyTrack/dependency-track \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
