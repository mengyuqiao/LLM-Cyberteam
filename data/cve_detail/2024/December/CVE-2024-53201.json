{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53201", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe\n\nThis commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in\ndcn20_program_pipe(). Previously, commit 8e4ed3cf1642 (\"drm/amd/display:\nAdd null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe\")\npartially fixed the null pointer dereference issue. However, in\ndcn20_update_dchubp_dpp(), the variable pipe_ctx is passed in, and\nplane_state is accessed again through pipe_ctx. Multiple if statements\ndirectly call attributes of plane_state, leading to potential null\npointer dereference issues. This patch adds necessary null checks to\nensure stability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53201", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b4ee2560d4d8de2688da68cd9581177035e0876", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3609259326171cd5b98462636580fb2ae5c87d40", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6a057072ddd127255350357dd880903e8fa23f36", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
