{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56337", "Description": "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97.\n\nThe mitigation for CVE-2024-50379 was incomplete.\n\nUsers running Tomcat on a case insensitive file system with the default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation \nparameter set to the non-default value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which version of Java they are using with Tomcat:\n- running on Java 8 or Java 11: the system property\u00a0sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false (it defaults to true)\n- running on Java 17: the\u00a0system property sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false\u00a0(it defaults to false)\n- running on Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is required\u00a0(the system property and the problematic cache have been removed)\n\nTomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks that\u00a0sun.io.useCanonCaches is set appropriately before allowing the default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file system. Tomcat will also set\u00a0sun.io.useCanonCaches to false by default where it can.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56337", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/b2b9qrgjrz1kvo4ym8y2wkfdvwoq6qbp", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] CVE-2024-56337 Apache Tomcat - RCE via write-enabled default servlet - CVE-2024-50379 mitigation was incomplete-Apache Mail Archives", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-50379", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-50379 | CVE", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
