{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-54037", "Description": "Adobe Connect versions 12.6, 11.4.7 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser session. By manipulating a DOM element through a crafted URL or user input, the attacker can inject malicious scripts that run when the page is rendered. This type of attack requires user interaction, as the victim would need to visit a malicious link or input data into a compromised form.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54037", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAdobe\u00bbConnectVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.4.7cpe:2.3:a:adobe:connect:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbConnectVersions  before (<) 11.4.9cpe:2.3:a:adobe:connect:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbConnectVersions  from including (>=) 12andup to, including, (<=) 12.6cpe:2.3:a:adobe:connect:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbConnectVersions  from including (>=) 12.0andbefore (<) 12.7cpe:2.3:a:adobe:connect:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-19  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/connect/apsb24-99.html", "ref_desc": "Adobe Security BulletinVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Q6mF0SDGGRe3wMdwl9lBkaLyrVw.html"}]}
