{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-55603", "Description": "Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`), to store the session data in a database. Therefore, when a `session_id` is given, kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`).\nThus, a session which's lifetime is already `> time()`, is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function, that does remove invalid sessions, is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()`, based on `session.gc_divisor`, `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1, session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus, an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-55603", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.php.net/manual/en/sessionhandlerinterface.gc.php", "ref_desc": "PHP: SessionHandlerInterface::gc - Manual", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/main/app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php#L40", "ref_desc": "kanboard/app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php at main \u00b7 kanboard/kanboard \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-divisor", "ref_desc": "PHP: Runtime Configuration - Manual", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/7ce61c34d962ca8b5dce776289ddf4b207be6e78", "ref_desc": "fix: verify the session hasn't expired before returning data \u00b7 kanboard/kanboard@7ce61c3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-probability", "ref_desc": "PHP: Runtime Configuration - Manual", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/security/advisories/GHSA-gv5c-8pxr-p484", "ref_desc": "Insufficient session invalidation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kanboard/kanboard \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php", "ref_desc": "PHP: session_start - Manual", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-maxlifetime", "ref_desc": "PHP: Runtime Configuration - Manual", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
