{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56657", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errors\n\nUsing WARN() for showing the error of symlink creations don't give\nmore information than telling that something goes wrong, since the\nusual code path is a lregister callback from each control element\ncreation.  More badly, the use of WARN() rather confuses fuzzer as if\nit were serious issues.\n\nThis patch downgrades the warning messages to use the normal dev_err()\ninstead of WARN().  For making it clearer, add the function name to\nthe prefix, too.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56657", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b2e538a9827dd04ab5273bf4be8eb2edb84357b0", "ref_desc": "ALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errors - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d5a1ca7b59804d6779644001a878ed925a4688ca", "ref_desc": "ALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errors - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36c0764474b637bbee498806485bed524cad486b", "ref_desc": "ALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errors - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
