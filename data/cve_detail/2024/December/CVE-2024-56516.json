{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56516", "Description": "free-one-api allows users to access large language model reverse engineering libraries through the standard OpenAI API format. In versions up to and including 1.0.1, MD5 is used to hash passwords before sending them to the backend. MD5 is a cryptographically broken hashing algorithm and is no longer considered secure for password storage or transmission. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be easily cracked using modern hardware, exposing user credentials to potential compromise. As of time of publication, a replacement for MD5 has not been committed to the free-one-api GitHub repository.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56516", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-328 Use of Weak Hash", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/328/Use-of-Weak-Hash.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RockChinQ/free-one-api/blob/4d6ee42ffbb224b95be32c26cabc28d54d01bf78/web/src/main.js#L15", "ref_desc": "free-one-api/web/src/main.js at 4d6ee42ffbb224b95be32c26cabc28d54d01bf78 \u00b7 RockChinQ/free-one-api \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RockChinQ/free-one-api/security/advisories/GHSA-36cc-58vm-wm4h", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
