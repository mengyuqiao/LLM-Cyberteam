{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56753", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu/gfx9: Add Cleaner Shader Deinitialization in gfx_v9_0 Module\n\nThis commit addresses an omission in the previous patch related to the\ncleaner shader support for GFX9 hardware. Specifically, it adds the\nnecessary deinitialization code for the cleaner shader in the\ngfx_v9_0_sw_fini function.\n\nThe added line amdgpu_gfx_cleaner_shader_sw_fini(adev); ensures that any\nallocated resources for the cleaner shader are freed correctly, avoiding\npotential memory leaks and ensuring that the GPU state is clean for the\nnext initialization sequence.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56753", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/720c0376b3d29cbab921a60062fda5980742ed9d", "ref_desc": "drm/amdgpu/gfx9: Add Cleaner Shader Deinitialization in gfx_v9_0 Module - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e47cb9d2533200d49dd5364d4a148119492f8a3d", "ref_desc": "drm/amdgpu/gfx9: Add Cleaner Shader Deinitialization in gfx_v9_0 Module - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
