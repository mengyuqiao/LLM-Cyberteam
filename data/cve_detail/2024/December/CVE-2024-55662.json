{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-55662", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.3-milestone-1 and prior to versions 15.10.9 and 16.3.0, on instances where `Extension Repository Application` is installed, any user can execute any code requiring `programming` rights on the server. This vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 15.10.9 and 16.3.0. Since `Extension Repository Application` is not mandatory, it can be safely disabled on instances that do not use it as a workaround. It is also possible to manually apply the patches from commit 8659f17d500522bf33595e402391592a35a162e8 to the page `ExtensionCode.ExtensionSheet` and to the page `ExtensionCode.ExtensionAuthorsDisplayer`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-55662", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-96 Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/96/Improper-Neutralization-of-Directives-in-Statically-Saved-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/8659f17d500522bf33595e402391592a35a162e8", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21890: Improve escaping in Extension Sheet \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@8659f17 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-j2pq-22jj-4pm5", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution through the extension sheet \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21890", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-21890] Remote code execution through the extension sheet - XWiki.org JIRA", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
