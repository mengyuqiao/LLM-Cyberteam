{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53990", "Description": "The AsyncHttpClient (AHC) library allows Java applications to easily execute HTTP requests and asynchronously process HTTP responses. When making any HTTP request, the automatically enabled and self-managed CookieStore (aka cookie jar) will silently replace explicitly defined Cookies with any that have the same name from the cookie jar. For services that operate with multiple users, this can result in one user's Cookie being used for another user's requests.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53990", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/security/advisories/GHSA-mfj5-cf8g-g2fv", "ref_desc": "`CookieStore` replaces explicitly defined `Cookie`s \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/pull/2033", "ref_desc": "[CookieStore] Only set `Cookie`s if they are not already set by pickypg \u00b7 Pull Request #2033 \u00b7 AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/1964", "ref_desc": "Cookie explicitly set on the request is getting discarded in favor of the one from the cookie jar \u00b7 Issue #1964 \u00b7 AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/commit/d5a83362f7aed81b93ebca559746ac9be0f95425", "ref_desc": "[CookieStore] Only set `Cookie`s if they are not already set (#2033) \u00b7 AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client@d5a8336 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
