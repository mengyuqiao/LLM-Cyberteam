{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53981", "Description": "python-multipart is a streaming multipart parser for Python. When parsing form data, python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \\r or LF \\n) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.18.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53981", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/security/advisories/GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3", "ref_desc": "Denial of service (DoS) via deformation `multipart/form-data` boundary \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Kludex/python-multipart \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart/commit/c4fe4d3cebc08c660e57dd709af1ffa7059b3177", "ref_desc": "Don't warn when CRLF is found after last boundary (#193) \u00b7 Kludex/python-multipart@c4fe4d3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
