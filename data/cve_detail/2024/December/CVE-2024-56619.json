{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56619", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry()\n\nSyzbot reported that when searching for records in a directory where the\ninode's i_size is corrupted and has a large value, memory access outside\nthe folio/page range may occur, or a use-after-free bug may be detected if\nKASAN is enabled.\n\nThis is because nilfs_last_byte(), which is called by nilfs_find_entry()\nand others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a\npage from i_size and the page index, loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit\nsize information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which\nthe i_size value is assigned.\n\nThis caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address\ncalculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry(), resulting in memory access\nthat exceeds the folio/page size.\n\nFix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit\nloss from \"unsigned int\" to \"u64\".  The return value of nilfs_last_byte()\nis also of type \"unsigned int\", but it is truncated so as not to exceed\nPAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56619", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/985ebec4ab0a28bb5910c3b1481a40fbf7f9e61d", "ref_desc": "nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/48eb6e7404948032bbe811c5affbe39f6b316951", "ref_desc": "nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c3afea07477baccdbdec4483f8d5e59d42a3f67f", "ref_desc": "nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5af8366625182f01f6d8465c9a3210574673af57", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09d6d05579fd46e61abf6e457bb100ff11f3a9d3", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31f7b57a77d4c82a34ddcb6ff35b5aa577ef153e", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3732102a9d638d8627d14fdf7b208462f0520e0", "ref_desc": "nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
