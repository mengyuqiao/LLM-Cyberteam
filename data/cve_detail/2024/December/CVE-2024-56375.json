{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56375", "Description": "An integer underflow was discovered in Fort 1.6.3 and 1.6.4 before 1.6.5. A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a Manifest RPKI object containing an empty fileList. Fort dereferences (and, shortly afterwards, writes to) this array during a shuffle attempt, before the validation that would normally reject it when empty. This out-of-bounds access is caused by an integer underflow that causes the surrounding loop to iterate infinitely. Because the product is permanently stuck attempting to overshuffle an array that doesn't actually exist, a crash is nearly guaranteed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56375", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/CVE.html", "ref_desc": "CVE | FORT Validator - RPKI Relying PartyCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4jQyPxhwWqQo5omPvRu_tfso44o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/154", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
