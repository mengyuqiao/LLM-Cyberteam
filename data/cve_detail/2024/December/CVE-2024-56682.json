Use\ndev_err_probe() to avoid printing an error message when returning\n-EPROBE_DEFER.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56682", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f181d1cda56c2fbe379c5ace1aa1fac6306669e", "ref_desc": "irqchip/riscv-aplic: Prevent crash when MSI domain is missing - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/285a07810ab3bcedc2bd380ebacbf6b4942a889a", "ref_desc": "irqchip/riscv-aplic: Prevent crash when MSI domain is missing - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
