{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-55655", "Description": "sigstore-python is a Python tool for generating and verifying Sigstore signatures. Versions of sigstore-python newer than 2.0.0 but prior to 3.6.0 perform insufficient validation of the \"integration time\" present in \"v2\" and \"v3\" bundles during the verification flow: the \"integration time\" is verified *if* a source of signed time (such as an inclusion promise) is present, but is otherwise trusted if no source of signed time is present. This does not affect \"v1\" bundles, as the \"v1\" bundle format always requires an inclusion promise.\n\nSigstore uses signed time to support verification of signatures made against short-lived signing keys. The impact and severity of this weakness is *low*, as Sigstore contains multiple other enforcing components that prevent an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp within a bundle from impersonating a valid signature. In particular, an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp can induce a Denial of Service, but in no different manner than already possible with bundle access (e.g. modifying the signature itself such that it fails to verify). Separately, an attacker could upload a *new* entry to the transparency service, and substitute their new entry's time. However, this would still be rejected at validation time, as the new entry's (valid) signed time would be outside the validity window of the original signing certificate and would nonetheless render the attacker auditable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-55655", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-325 Missing Cryptographic Step", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/325/Missing-Cryptographic-Step.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/commit/300b502ae99ebfaace124f1f4e422a6a669369cf", "ref_desc": "fix: require an inclusion promise when log integration time is used (\u2026 \u00b7 sigstore/sigstore-python@300b502 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/security/advisories/GHSA-hhfg-fwrw-87w7", "ref_desc": "Insufficient validation of integration timestamp during verification \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sigstore/sigstore-python \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/releases/tag/v3.6.0", "ref_desc": "Release v3.6.0 \u00b7 sigstore/sigstore-python \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
