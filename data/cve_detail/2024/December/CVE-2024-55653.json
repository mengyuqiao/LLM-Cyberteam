{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-55653", "Description": "PwnDoc is a penetration test report generator. In versions up to and including 0.5.3, an authenticated user is able to crash the backend by raising a `UnhandledPromiseRejection` on audits which exits the backend. The user doesn't need to know the audit id, since a bad audit id will also raise the rejection. With the backend being unresponsive, the whole application becomes unusable for all users of the application. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-55653", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc/security/advisories/GHSA-ggqg-3f7v-c8rc", "ref_desc": "UnhandledPromiseRejection on audits causes Denial of Service (DoS) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pwndoc/pwndoc \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
