{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53256", "Description": "Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. `rizin.c` still had an old snippet of code which suffered a command injection due the usage of `rz_core_cmdf` to invoke the command `m` which was removed in v0.1.x. A malicious binary defining `bclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is executed if `rclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is set to `fs`; the vulnerability can be exploited by any bin format where `bclass` and `rclass` are user defined. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.7.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53256", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/be24ca8879ed9c58f288bdf21c271b6294720da4/librz/main/rizin.c#L1275-L1278", "ref_desc": "rizin/librz/main/rizin.c at be24ca8879ed9c58f288bdf21c271b6294720da4 \u00b7 rizinorg/rizin \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/db6c5b39c065ce719f587c9815c47fbb834b10fa", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/security/advisories/GHSA-5jhc-frm4-p8v9", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
