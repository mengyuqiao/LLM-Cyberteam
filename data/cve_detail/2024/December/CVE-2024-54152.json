{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-54152", "Description": "Angular Expressions provides expressions for the Angular.JS web framework as a standalone module. Prior to version 1.4.3, an attacker can write a malicious expression that escapes the sandbox to execute arbitrary code on the system. With a more complex (undisclosed) payload, one can get full access to Arbitrary code execution on the system. The problem has been patched in version 1.4.3 of Angular Expressions. Two possible workarounds are available. One may either disable access to `__proto__` globally or make sure that one uses the function with just one argument.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54152", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/peerigon/angular-expressions/commit/97f7ad94006156eeb97fc942332578b6cfbf8eef", "ref_desc": "Fix CVE-2024-54152 \u00b7 peerigon/angular-expressions@97f7ad9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/peerigon/angular-expressions/security/advisories/GHSA-5462-4vcx-jh7j", "ref_desc": "Angular Expressions - Remote Code Execution when using locals \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 peerigon/angular-expressions \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
