{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-54135", "Description": "ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. ClipBucket-v5 Version 2.0 to Version 5.5.1 Revision 199 are vulnerable to PHP Deserialization vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in upload/photo_upload.php  within the decode_key function. User inputs were supplied to this function without sanitization via collection GET parameter and photoIDS POST parameter respectively. The decode_key function invokes PHP unserialize function as defined in upload/includes/classes/photos.class.php. As a result, it is possible for an adversary to inject maliciously crafted PHP serialized object and utilize gadget chains to cause unexpected behaviors of the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 Revision 200.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54135", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/76a829c088f0813ab3244a3bd0036111017409b0", "ref_desc": "Front office : Fix upload security issue (Thanks @0xbko) \u00b7 MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5@76a829c \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nySMxe5Z_vjI44x6JGQXTXmsMcU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-4523-mqmv-wrqx", "ref_desc": "Untrusted Deserialization in ClipBucket-v5 Version 2.0 to 5.5.1 Revision 199 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
