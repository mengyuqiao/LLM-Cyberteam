{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-54133", "Description": "Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. There is a possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability  in the `content_security_policy` helper starting in version 5.2.0 of Action Pack and prior to versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1. Applications which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers dynamically from untrusted user input may be vulnerable to carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new directives into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its protection against XSS and other attacks. Versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1 contain a fix. As a workaround, applications can avoid setting CSP headers dynamically from untrusted input, or can validate/sanitize that input.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-54133", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5558e72f22fc69c1c407b31ac5fb3b4ce087b542", "ref_desc": "Add CSP directive validation \u00b7 rails/rails@5558e72 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-vfm5-rmrh-j26v", "ref_desc": "Possible Content Security Policy bypass in Action Dispatch \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rails/rails \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3da2479cfe1e00177114b17e496213c40d286b3a", "ref_desc": "Add CSP directive validation \u00b7 rails/rails@3da2479 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/cb16a3bb515b5d769f73926d9757270ace691f1d", "ref_desc": "Add CSP directive validation \u00b7 rails/rails@cb16a3b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2e3f41e4538b9ca1044357f6644f037bbb7c6c49", "ref_desc": "Add CSP directive validation \u00b7 rails/rails@2e3f41e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
