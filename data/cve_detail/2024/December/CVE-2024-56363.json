{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56363", "Description": "APTRS (Automated Penetration Testing Reporting System) is a Python and Django-based automated reporting tool designed for penetration testers and security organizations. In 1.0, there is a vulnerability in the web application's handling of user-supplied input that is incorporated into a Jinja2 template. Specifically, when user input is improperly sanitized or validated, an attacker can inject Jinja2 syntax into the template, causing the server to execute arbitrary code. For example, an attacker might be able to inject expressions like {{ config }}, {{ self.class.mro[1].subclasses() }}, or more dangerous payloads that trigger execution of arbitrary Python code. The vulnerability can be reproduced by submitting crafted input to all the template fields handled by ckeditor, that are passed directly to a Jinja2 template. If the input is rendered without sufficient sanitization, it results in the execution of malicious Jinja2 code on the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56363", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-97 Improper Neutralization of Server-Side Includes (SSI) Within a Web Page", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/97/Improper-Neutralization-of-Server-Side-Includes-SSI-Within.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/APTRS/APTRS/security/advisories/GHSA-h4w2-hvcg-938j", "ref_desc": "Server Side Template Injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 APTRS/APTRS \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/APTRS/APTRS/commit/9f6b6e4a56a9119eb12126a4909441e83b6d7c11", "ref_desc": "Fixed SSTI \u00b7 APTRS/APTRS@9f6b6e4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
