{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56327", "Description": "pyrage is a set of Python bindings for the rage file encryption library (age in Rust). `pyrage` uses the Rust `age` crate for its underlying operations, and `age` is vulnerable to GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w. All details of GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w are relevant to `pyrage` for the versions specified in this advisory. See GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w for full details. Versions of `pyrage` before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are therefore **not affected**. An equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go implementation of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), see advisory GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.3 and all users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56327", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/security/advisories/GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w", "ref_desc": "rage vulnerable to malicious plugin names, recipients, or identities causing arbitrary binary execution \u00b7 GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/woodruffw/pyrage/security/advisories/GHSA-47h8-jmp3-9f28", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
