{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53186", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix use-after-free in SMB request handling\n\nA race condition exists between SMB request handling in\n`ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` and the freeing of `ksmbd_conn` in the\nworkqueue handler `handle_ksmbd_work()`. This leads to a UAF.\n- KASAN: slab-use-after-free Read in handle_ksmbd_work\n- KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rtlock_slowlock_locked\n\nThis race condition arises as follows:\n- `ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` waits for `conn->r_count` to reach zero:\n  `wait_event(conn->r_count_q, atomic_read(&conn->r_count) == 0);`\n- Meanwhile, `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count` using\n  `atomic_dec_return(&conn->r_count)`, and if it reaches zero, calls\n  `ksmbd_conn_free()`, which frees `conn`.\n- However, after `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count`,\n  it may still access `conn->r_count_q` in the following line:\n  `waitqueue_active(&conn->r_count_q)` or `wake_up(&conn->r_count_q)`\n  This results in a UAF, as `conn` has already been freed.\n\nThe discovery of this UAF can be referenced in the following PR for\nsyzkaller's support for SMB requests.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53186", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/96261adb998a3b513468b6ce17dbec76be5507d4", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a8c5d89d327ff58e9b2517f8a6afb4181d32c6e", "ref_desc": "ksmbd: fix use-after-free in SMB request handling - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f20b77f7897e6aab9ce5527e6016ad2be5d70a33", "ref_desc": "ksmbd: fix use-after-free in SMB request handling - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a96f9eb7add30ba0fafcfe7b7aca090978196800", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
