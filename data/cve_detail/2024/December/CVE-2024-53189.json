{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53189", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: nl80211: fix bounds checker error in nl80211_parse_sched_scan\n\nThe channels array in the cfg80211_scan_request has a __counted_by\nattribute attached to it, which points to the n_channels variable. This\nattribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the\narray is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a\nkernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.\n\nThis patch sets the size of allocated memory as the initial value for\nn_channels. It is updated with the actual number of added elements after\nthe array is filled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53189", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9c46a3a5b394d6d123866aa44436fc2cd342eb0d", "ref_desc": "wifi: nl80211: fix bounds checker error in nl80211_parse_sched_scan - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d4ef643ea78c59c22546046c25dc6e7206267672", "ref_desc": "wifi: nl80211: fix bounds checker error in nl80211_parse_sched_scan - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1a7b62ddf2c7642878c24f0e556041bb58c37527", "ref_desc": "wifi: nl80211: fix bounds checker error in nl80211_parse_sched_scan - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
