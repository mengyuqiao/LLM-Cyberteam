{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-55890", "Description": "D-Tale is a visualizer for pandas data structures. Prior to version 3.16.1, users hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to remote code execution allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server. Users should upgrade to version 3.16.1 where the `update-settings` endpoint blocks the ability for users to update the `enable_custom_filters` flag. The only workaround for versions earlier than 3.16.1 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-55890", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/man-group/dtale/commit/1e26ed3ca12fe83812b90f12a2b3e5fb0b740f7a", "ref_desc": "https://github.com/man-group/dtale/issues/894: updates to 'update-set\u2026 \u00b7 man-group/dtale@1e26ed3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/man-group/dtale#custom-filter", "ref_desc": "GitHub - man-group/dtale: Visualizer for pandas data structuresCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Mnl1r2I_eINykrL14emZTqIRjYw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/man-group/dtale/security/advisories/GHSA-832w-fhmw-w4f4", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution through the Custom Filter Input using update-settings endpoint to turn on custom filters \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 man-group/dtale \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
