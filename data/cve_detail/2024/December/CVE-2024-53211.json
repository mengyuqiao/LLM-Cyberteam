{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-53211", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/l2tp: fix warning in l2tp_exit_net found by syzbot\n\nIn l2tp's net exit handler, we check that an IDR is empty before\ndestroying it:\n\n\tWARN_ON_ONCE(!idr_is_empty(&pn->l2tp_tunnel_idr));\n\tidr_destroy(&pn->l2tp_tunnel_idr);\n\nBy forcing memory allocation failures in idr_alloc_32, syzbot is able\nto provoke a condition where idr_is_empty returns false despite there\nbeing no items in the IDR. This turns out to be because the radix tree\nof the IDR contains only internal radix-tree nodes and it is this that\ncauses idr_is_empty to return false. The internal nodes are cleaned by\nidr_destroy.\n\nUse idr_for_each to check that the IDR is empty instead of\nidr_is_empty to avoid the problem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53211", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5d066766c5f1252f98ff859265bcd1a5b52ac46c", "ref_desc": "net/l2tp: fix warning in l2tp_exit_net found by syzbot - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a487cc8986d6dd75b60b59004f3bd2ea9b4dd541", "ref_desc": "net/l2tp: fix warning in l2tp_exit_net found by syzbot - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
