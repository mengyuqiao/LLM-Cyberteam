{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56722", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hns: Fix cpu stuck caused by printings during reset\n\nDuring reset, cmd to destroy resources such as qp, cq, and mr may fail,\nand error logs will be printed. When a large number of resources are\ndestroyed, there will be lots of printings, and it may lead to a cpu\nstuck.\n\nDelete some unnecessary printings and replace other printing functions\nin these paths with the ratelimited version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56722", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e2e64f9c42c717beb459ab209ec1c4baa73d3760", "ref_desc": "RDMA/hns: Fix cpu stuck caused by printings during reset - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a0e4c78770faa0d56d47391476fe1d827e72eded", "ref_desc": "RDMA/hns: Fix cpu stuck caused by printings during reset - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/323275ac2ff15b2b7b3eac391ae5d8c5a3c3a999", "ref_desc": "RDMA/hns: Fix cpu stuck caused by printings during reset - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4ba31e5aaffbda9b22d9a35c40b16dc39e475a6", "ref_desc": "RDMA/hns: Fix cpu stuck caused by printings during reset - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31c6fe9b79ed42440094f2367897aea0c0ce96ec", "ref_desc": "RDMA/hns: Fix cpu stuck caused by printings during reset - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
