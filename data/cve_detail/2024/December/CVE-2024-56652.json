{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-56652", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe/reg_sr: Remove register pool\n\nThat pool implementation doesn't really work: if the krealloc happens to\nmove the memory and return another address, the entries in the xarray\nbecome invalid, leading to use-after-free later:\n\n\tBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in xe_reg_sr_apply_mmio+0x570/0x760 [xe]\n\tRead of size 4 at addr ffff8881244b2590 by task modprobe/2753\n\n\tAllocated by task 2753:\n\t kasan_save_stack+0x39/0x70\n\t kasan_save_track+0x14/0x40\n\t kasan_save_alloc_info+0x37/0x60\n\t __kasan_kmalloc+0xc3/0xd0\n\t __kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof+0x200/0x6d0\n\t krealloc_noprof+0x229/0x380\n\nSimplify the code to fix the bug.
