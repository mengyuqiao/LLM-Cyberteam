{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34713", "Description": "sshproxy is used on a gateway to transparently proxy a user SSH connection on the gateway to an internal host via SSH. Prior to version 1.6.3, any user authorized to connect to a ssh server using `sshproxy` can inject options to the `ssh` command executed by `sshproxy`. All versions of `sshproxy` are impacted. The problem is patched starting in version 1.6.3. The only workaround is to use the `force_command` option in `sshproxy.yaml`, but it's rarely relevant.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34713", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cea-hpc/sshproxy/commit/f7eabd05d5f0f951e160293692327cad9a7d9580", "ref_desc": "Prevent ssh option injection (#16) \u00b7 cea-hpc/sshproxy@f7eabd0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cea-hpc/sshproxy/security/advisories/GHSA-jmqp-37m5-49wh", "ref_desc": "SSH option injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cea-hpc/sshproxy \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
