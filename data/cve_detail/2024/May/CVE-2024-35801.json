{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35801", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD\n\nCommit 672365477ae8 (\"x86/fpu: Update XFD state where required\") and\ncommit 8bf26758ca96 (\"x86/fpu: Add XFD state to fpstate\") introduced a\nper CPU variable xfd_state to keep the MSR_IA32_XFD value cached, in\norder to avoid unnecessary writes to the MSR.\n\nOn CPU hotplug MSR_IA32_XFD is reset to the init_fpstate.xfd, which\nwipes out any stale state. But the per CPU cached xfd value is not\nreset, which brings them out of sync.\n\nAs a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to update\nthe MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernel\nspace, which crashes the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state together\nwith MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35801", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/21c7c00dae55cb0e3810d5f9506b58f68475d41d", "ref_desc": "x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/92b0f04e937665bde5768f3fcc622dcce44413d8", "ref_desc": "x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10e4b5166df9ff7a2d5316138ca668b42d004422", "ref_desc": "x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b61e3b7055ac6edee4be071c52f48c26472d2624", "ref_desc": "x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1acbca933313aa866e39996904c9aca4d435c4cd", "ref_desc": "x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
