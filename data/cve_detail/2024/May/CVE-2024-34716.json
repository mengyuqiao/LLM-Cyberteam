{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34716", "Description": "PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that only affects PrestaShops with customer-thread feature flag enabled is present starting from PrestaShop 8.1.0 and prior to PrestaShop 8.1.6. When the customer thread feature flag is enabled through the front-office contact form, a hacker can upload a malicious file containing an XSS that will be executed when an admin opens the attached file in back office. The script injected can access the session and the security token, which allows it to perform any authenticated action in the scope of the administrator's right. This vulnerability is patched in 8.1.6. A workaround is to disable the customer-thread feature-flag.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34716", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/8.1.6", "ref_desc": "Release PrestaShop 8.1.6 \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gWqMvaoJjHNCBZwGDJ0Y4QWKrLA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-45vm-3j38-7p78", "ref_desc": "XSS via customer contact form in FO, through file upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
