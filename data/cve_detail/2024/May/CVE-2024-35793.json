Turns out that despite\nall the review on the locking, we missed completely that the\nlogic is wrong: if the refcount hits zero we can finish (and\nneed not wait for the completion), but if it doesn't we have\nto trigger all the cancellations. As written, we can _never_\nget into the loop triggering the cancellations. Fix this, and\nexplain it better while at it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35793", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d08cca5fd0aabb62b7015067ab40913b33da906", "ref_desc": "debugfs: fix wait/cancellation handling during remove - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/952c3fce297f12c7ff59380adb66b564e2bc9b64", "ref_desc": "debugfs: fix wait/cancellation handling during remove - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e88b5ae01901c4a655a53158397746334778a57b", "ref_desc": "debugfs: fix wait/cancellation handling during remove - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
