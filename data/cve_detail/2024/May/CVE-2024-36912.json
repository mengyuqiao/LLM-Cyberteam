{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36912", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nDrivers: hv: vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadl\n\nIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause\nset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an\nerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to\ntake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)\nmemory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security\nissues.\n\nIn order to make sure callers of vmbus_establish_gpadl() and\nvmbus_teardown_gpadl() don't return decrypted/shared pages to\nallocators, add a field in struct vmbus_gpadl to keep track of the\ndecryption status of the buffers. This will allow the callers to\nknow if they should free or leak the pages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36912", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1258 Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1258/Exposure-of-Sensitive-System-Information-Due-to-Uncleared-De.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1999644d95194d4a58d3e80ad04ce19220a01a81", "ref_desc": "Drivers: hv: vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadl - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/211f514ebf1ef5de37b1cf6df9d28a56cfd242ca", "ref_desc": "Drivers: hv: vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadl - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bfae56be077ba14311509e70706a13458f87ea99", "ref_desc": "Drivers: hv: vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadl - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e62341f5c45b27519b7d193bcc32ada416ad9d8", "ref_desc": "Drivers: hv: vmbus: Track decrypted status in vmbus_gpadl - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
