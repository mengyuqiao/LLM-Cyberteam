{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36932", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal\n\nSince thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock, it can\nrun in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() and it may free\nthe struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been\nchecked against NULL.\n\nIf that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory\nthat has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.\n\nAddress this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() around\nthe cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at the\nsame time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.\n\nCc :6.8+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 6.8+", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36932", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.8andbefore (<) 6.8.10cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1279dee33369e2525f532364bb87207d23b9481", "ref_desc": "thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d351eb0ab04c3e8109895fc33250cebbce9c11da", "ref_desc": "thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
