{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34068", "Description": "Pterodactyl wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. An authenticated user who has access to a game server is able to bypass the previously implemented access control (GHSA-6rg3-8h8x-5xfv) that prevents accessing internal endpoints of the node hosting Wings in the pull endpoint. This would allow malicious users to potentially access resources on local networks that would otherwise be inaccessible. This issue has been addressed in version 1.11.2 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may enable the `api.disable_remote_download` option as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34068", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-441 Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/441/Unintended-Proxy-or-Intermediary-Confused-Deputy-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-qq22-jj8x-4wwv", "ref_desc": "Server-side Request Forgery during remote file pull \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-6rg3-8h8x-5xfv", "ref_desc": "Unchecked hostname resolution could allow access to local network resources by users outside the local network \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/c152e36101aba45d8868a9a0eeb890995e8934b8", "ref_desc": "downloader: move internal subnet validation into http Transport \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings@c152e36 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
