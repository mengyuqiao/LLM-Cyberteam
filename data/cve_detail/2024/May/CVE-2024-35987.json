{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35987", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: Fix loading 64-bit NOMMU kernels past the start of RAM\n\ncommit 3335068f8721 (\"riscv: Use PUD/P4D/PGD pages for the linear\nmapping\") added logic to allow using RAM below the kernel load address.\nHowever, this does not work for NOMMU, where PAGE_OFFSET is fixed to the\nkernel load address. Since that range of memory corresponds to PFNs\nbelow ARCH_PFN_OFFSET, mm initialization runs off the beginning of\nmem_map and corrupts adjacent kernel memory. Fix this by restoring the\nprevious behavior for NOMMU kernels.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35987", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ea6628e4e2353978af7e3b4ad4fdaab6149acf3d", "ref_desc": "riscv: Fix loading 64-bit NOMMU kernels past the start of RAM - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b008e327fa570aca210f98c817757649bae56694", "ref_desc": "riscv: Fix loading 64-bit NOMMU kernels past the start of RAM - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aea702dde7e9876fb00571a2602f25130847bf0f", "ref_desc": "riscv: Fix loading 64-bit NOMMU kernels past the start of RAM - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
