{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34706", "Description": "Valtimo is an open source business process and case management platform. When opening a form in Valtimo, the access token (JWT) of the user is exposed to `api.form.io` via the the `x-jwt-token` header. An attacker can retrieve personal information from this token, or use it to execute requests to the Valtimo REST API on behalf of the logged-in user. This issue is caused by a misconfiguration of the Form.io component.\n\nThe following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: An attacker needs to have access to the network traffic on the `api.form.io` domain; the content of the `x-jwt-token` header is logged or otherwise available to the attacker; an attacker needs to have network access to the Valtimo API; and an attacker needs to act within the time-to-live of the access token. The default TTL in Keycloak is 5 minutes.\n\nVersions 10.8.4, 11.1.6 and 11.2.2 have been patched.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34706", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/commit/8c2dbf2a41180d2b0358d878290e4d37168f0fb6", "ref_desc": "TP Story #110428 - [FE] Exposed JWT token to form.io (#955) \u00b7 valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries@8c2dbf2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/commit/d65e05fd2784bd4a628778b34a5b79ce2f0cef8c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #963 from valtimo-platform/fix/form-io-token-10-8-\u2026 \u00b7 valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries@d65e05f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-xcp4-62vj-cq3r", "ref_desc": "@valtimo/components exposes access token to form.io \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/commit/1aaba5ef5750dafebbc7476fb08bf2375a25f19e", "ref_desc": "TP Story #110428 - [FE] Exposed JWT token to form.io (#955) \u00b7 valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries@1aaba5e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
