{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35236", "Description": "Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35236", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/ce7f891b9b2cb57c6644aaf96f89a8bda6307664", "ref_desc": "Update:Disable epubs from running scripts by default, add library set\u2026 \u00b7 advplyr/audiobookshelf@ce7f891 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/04ed4810fdfcafc2e82db536edc5870e3f937d00/client/components/readers/EpubReader.vue#L319", "ref_desc": "audiobookshelf/client/components/readers/EpubReader.vue at 04ed4810fdfcafc2e82db536edc5870e3f937d00 \u00b7 advplyr/audiobookshelf \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-7j99-76cj-q9pg", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability via crafted ebooks \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 advplyr/audiobookshelf \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/releases/tag/v2.10.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.10.0 \u00b7 advplyr/audiobookshelf \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/assets/36849099/46f6dfe0-9860-4ec0-a987-b3a553f7e45d", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
