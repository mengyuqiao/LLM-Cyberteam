Driver\nthinks DTBCLK is disabled by default, so we don't send disable message to\nPMFW. DTBCLK is then enabled at idle desktop on boot, burning power.\n\n[How]\nSet dtbclk_en to true on boot so that disable message is sent during first\ncommit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35906", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0dab75b433ed2480d57ae4f8f725186a46223e42", "ref_desc": "Revert \"drm/amd/display: Send DTBCLK disable message on first commit\" - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treeCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7zQwIJeLL_s874p8UQLbRSx_VYg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f341055b10bd8be55c3c995dff5f770b236b8ca9", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Send DTBCLK disable message on first commit - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
