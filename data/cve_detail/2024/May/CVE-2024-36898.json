{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36898", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpiolib: cdev: fix uninitialised kfifo\n\nIf a line is requested with debounce, and that results in debouncing\nin software, and the line is subsequently reconfigured to enable edge\ndetection then the allocation of the kfifo to contain edge events is\noverlooked.  This results in events being written to and read from an\nuninitialised kfifo.  Read events are returned to userspace.\n\nInitialise the kfifo in the case where the software debounce is\nalready active.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36898", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee0166b637a5e376118e9659e5b4148080f1d27e", "ref_desc": "gpiolib: cdev: fix uninitialised kfifo - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1a51e24404d77bb3307c1e39eee0d8e86febb1a5", "ref_desc": "gpiolib: cdev: fix uninitialised kfifo - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/883e4bbf06eb5fb7482679e4edb201093e9f55a2", "ref_desc": "gpiolib: cdev: fix uninitialised kfifo - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bd7139a70ee8d8ea872b223e043730cf6f5e2b0e", "ref_desc": "gpiolib: cdev: fix uninitialised kfifo - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
