{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34351", "Description": "Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions. If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself. The required conditions are 1) Next.js is running in a self-hosted manner; 2) the Next.js application makes use of Server Actions; and 3) the Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`. This vulnerability was fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34351", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-12  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-17  0.06%  0.12%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-05-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62561", "ref_desc": "Improve redirection handling by shuding \u00b7 Pull Request #62561 \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/8f7a6ca7d21a97bc9f7a1bbe10427b5ad74b9085", "ref_desc": "Improve redirection handling (#62561) \u00b7 vercel/next.js@8f7a6ca \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-fr5h-rqp8-mj6g", "ref_desc": "Server-Side Request Forgery in Server Actions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
