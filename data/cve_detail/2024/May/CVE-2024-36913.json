{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36913", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nDrivers: hv: vmbus: Leak pages if set_memory_encrypted() fails\n\nIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause\nset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an\nerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to\ntake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)\nmemory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security\nissues.\n\nVMBus code could free decrypted pages if set_memory_encrypted()/decrypted()\nfails. Leak the pages if this happens.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36913", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1258 Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1258/Exposure-of-Sensitive-System-Information-Due-to-Uncleared-De.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e813a0fc2e597146e9cebea61ced9c796d4e308f", "ref_desc": "Drivers: hv: vmbus: Leak pages if set_memory_encrypted() fails - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/03f5a999adba062456c8c818a683beb1b498983a", "ref_desc": "Drivers: hv: vmbus: Leak pages if set_memory_encrypted() fails - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6123a4e8e25bd40cf44db14694abac00e6b664e6", "ref_desc": "Drivers: hv: vmbus: Leak pages if set_memory_encrypted() fails - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
