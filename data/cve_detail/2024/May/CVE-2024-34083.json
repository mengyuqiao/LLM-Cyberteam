{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34083", "Description": "aiosmptd is  a reimplementation of the Python stdlib smtpd.py based on asyncio. Prior to version 1.4.6, servers based on aiosmtpd accept extra unencrypted commands after STARTTLS, treating them as if they came from inside the encrypted connection. This could be exploited by a man-in-the-middle attack. Version 1.4.6 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34083", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-349 Acceptance of Extraneous Untrusted Data With Trusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/349/Acceptance-of-Extraneous-Untrusted-Data-With-Trusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiosmtpd/commit/b3a4a2c6ecfd228856a20d637dc383541fcdbfda", "ref_desc": "starttls: Clear unencrypted commands from buffer (#380) \u00b7 aio-libs/aiosmtpd@b3a4a2c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nostarttls.secvuln.info", "ref_desc": "NO STARTTLSCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jYD-0rECyiWrfIIMsPoEOdbH56c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiosmtpd/security/advisories/GHSA-wgjv-9j3q-jhg8", "ref_desc": "STARTTLS unencrypted commands injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aio-libs/aiosmtpd \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
