{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34070", "Description": "Froxlor is open source server administration software. Prior to 2.1.9, a Stored Blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the Failed Login Attempts Logging Feature of the Froxlor Application. An unauthenticated User can inject malicious scripts in the loginname parameter on the Login attempt, which will then be executed when viewed by the Administrator in the System Logs.  By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform various malicious actions such as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34070", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/froxlor/Froxlor/security/advisories/GHSA-x525-54hf-xr53", "ref_desc": "Blind XSS Leading to Froxlor Application Compromise \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 froxlor/Froxlor \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/froxlor/Froxlor/commit/a862307bce5cdfb1c208b835f3e8faddd23046e6", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-x525-54hf-xr53 \u00b7 froxlor/Froxlor@a862307 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
