{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35808", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly\n\nCurrently md_reap_sync_thread() is called from raid_message() directly\nwithout holding 'reconfig_mutex', this is definitely unsafe because\nmd_reap_sync_thread() can change many fields that is protected by\n'reconfig_mutex'.\n\nHowever, hold 'reconfig_mutex' here is still problematic because this\nwill cause deadlock, for example, commit 130443d60b1b (\"md: refactor\nidle/frozen_sync_thread() to fix deadlock\").\n\nFix this problem by using stop_sync_thread() to unregister sync_thread,\nlike md/raid did.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35808", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9e59b8d76ff511505eb0dd1478329f09e0f04669", "ref_desc": "md/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cd32b27a66db8776d8b8e82ec7d7dde97a8693b0", "ref_desc": "md/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/347dcdc15a1706f61aa545ae498ededdf31aeebc", "ref_desc": "md/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
