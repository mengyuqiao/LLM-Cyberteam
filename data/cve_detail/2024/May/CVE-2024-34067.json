{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34067", "Description": "Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel built with PHP, React, and Go. Importing a malicious egg or gaining access to wings instance could lead to cross site scripting (XSS) on the panel, which could be used to gain an administrator account on the panel. Specifically, the following things are impacted: Egg Docker images and Egg variables: Name, Environment variable, Default value, Description, Validation rules. Additionally, certain fields would reflect malicious input, but it would require the user knowingly entering such input to have an impact. To iterate, this would require an administrator to perform actions and can't be triggered by a normal panel user. This issue has has been addressed in version 1.11.6 and users are advised to upgrade. No workaround is available other than updating to the latest version of the panel.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34067", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/f671046947e4695b5e1c647df79305c1cefdf817", "ref_desc": "admin: tweaks to validation and rendering \u00b7 pterodactyl/panel@f671046 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/1172d71d31561c4e465dabdf6b838e64de48ad16", "ref_desc": "app: improve `docker_image` validation \u00b7 pterodactyl/panel@1172d71 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/0dad4c5a488661f9adc27dd311542516d9bfa0f2", "ref_desc": "ui(admin): better handling of manual HTML rendering \u00b7 pterodactyl/panel@0dad4c5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-384w-wffr-x63q", "ref_desc": "Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in the admin area \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/panel \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
