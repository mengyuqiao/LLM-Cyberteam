{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35952", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/ast: Fix soft lockup\n\nThere is a while-loop in ast_dp_set_on_off() that could lead to\ninfinite-loop. This is because the register, VGACRI-Dx, checked in\nthis API is a scratch register actually controlled by a MCU, named\nDPMCU, in BMC.\n\nThese scratch registers are protected by scu-lock. If suc-lock is not\noff, DPMCU can not update these registers and then host will have soft\nlockup due to never updated status.\n\nDPMCU is used to control DP and relative registers to handshake with\nhost's VGA driver. Even the most time-consuming task, DP's link\ntraining, is less than 100ms. 200ms should be enough.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35952", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8a6fea3fcb577a543ef67683ca7105bde49a38fb", "ref_desc": "drm/ast: Fix soft lockup - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a81b2acd43e24e419f65df97348c76a5a1496066", "ref_desc": "drm/ast: Fix soft lockup - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/35768baf0fdfc47ede42d899506bad78450e9294", "ref_desc": "drm/ast: Fix soft lockup - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bc004f5038220b1891ef4107134ccae44be55109", "ref_desc": "drm/ast: Fix soft lockup - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
