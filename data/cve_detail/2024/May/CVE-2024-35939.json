{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35939", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndma-direct: Leak pages on dma_set_decrypted() failure\n\nOn TDX it is possible for the untrusted host to cause\nset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an\nerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to\ntake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)\nmemory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security\nissues.\n\nDMA could free decrypted/shared pages if dma_set_decrypted() fails. This\nshould be a rare case. Just leak the pages in this case instead of\nfreeing them.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35939", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b9fa16949d18e06bdf728a560f5c8af56d2bdcaf", "ref_desc": "dma-direct: Leak pages on dma_set_decrypted() failure - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4031b72ca747a1e6e9ae4fa729e765b43363d66a", "ref_desc": "dma-direct: Leak pages on dma_set_decrypted() failure - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e0cfb25d49da2e6261ad582f58ffa5b5dd8c8e9", "ref_desc": "dma-direct: Leak pages on dma_set_decrypted() failure - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b57326c96b7bc7638aa8c44e12afa2defe0c934c", "ref_desc": "dma-direct: Leak pages on dma_set_decrypted() failure - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
