{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32890", "Description": "librespeed/speedtest is an open source, self-hosted speed test for HTML5. In affected versions missing neutralization of the ISP information in a speedtest result leads to stored Cross-site scripting in the JSON API. The `processedString` field in the `ispinfo` parameter is missing neutralization. It is stored when a user submits a speedtest result to the telemetry API (`results/telemetry.php`) and returned in the JSON API (`results/json.php`). This vulnerability has been introduced in commit 3937b94. This vulnerability affects LibreSpeed speedtest instances running version 5.2.5 or higher which have telemetry enabled and has been addressed in version 5.3.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32890", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "N/A", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest/commit/3937b940e80b734acae36cd41a2a31819593e728", "ref_desc": "Results can now be fetched in json format instead of just an image (r\u2026 \u00b7 librespeed/speedtest@3937b94 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest/commit/dd1ce2cb8830d94dcaa0b8e70b9406144a0e5f8d", "ref_desc": "Fixed vulnerability in json.php caused my missing Content-Type header \u00b7 librespeed/speedtest@dd1ce2c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest/security/advisories/GHSA-3954-xrwh-fq4q", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in results JSON API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 librespeed/speedtest \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
