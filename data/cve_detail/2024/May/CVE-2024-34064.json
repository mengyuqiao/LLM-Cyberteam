{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34064", "Description": "Jinja is an extensible templating engine. The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34064", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-11  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SSCBHIL6BYKR5NRCBXP4XMP2CEEKGFVS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: python-jinja2-3.1.4-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZALNWE3TXPPHVPSI3AZ5CTMSTAVN5UMS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: python-jinja2-3.1.4-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/567XIGSZMABG6TSMYWD7MIYNJSUQQRUC/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: mingw-python-jinja2-3.1.4-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GCLF44KY43BSVMTE6S53B4V5WP3FRRSE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: mingw-python-jinja2-3.1.4-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-h75v-3vvj-5mfj", "ref_desc": "Jinja vulnerable to HTML attribute injection when passing user input as keys to xmlattr filter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pallets/jinja \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/0668239dc6b44ef38e7a6c9f91f312fd4ca581cb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-h75v-3vvj-5mfj \u00b7 pallets/jinja@0668239 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
