{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35231", "Description": "rack-contrib provides contributed rack middleware and utilities for Rack, a Ruby web server interface. Versions of rack-contrib prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not constrained to any limitation. This would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation and a potential denial of service by remotely user-controlled data. Version 2.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35231", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-8c8q-2xw3-j869", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service due to the unconstrained value of the incoming \"profiler_runs\" parameter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rack/rack-contrib \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/commit/0eec2a9836329051c6742549e65a94a4c24fe6f7", "ref_desc": "Specify a maximum number of runs to limit the request params -> DoS. \u2026 \u00b7 rack/rack-contrib@0eec2a9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
