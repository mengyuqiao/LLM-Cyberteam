{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35908", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: get psock ref after taking rxlock to avoid leak\n\nAt the start of tls_sw_recvmsg, we take a reference on the psock, and\nthen call tls_rx_reader_lock. If that fails, we return directly\nwithout releasing the reference.\n\nInstead of adding a new label, just take the reference after locking\nhas succeeded, since we don't need it before.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35908", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1b7f14130d782433bc98c1e1e41ce6b4d4c3096", "ref_desc": "tls: get psock ref after taking rxlock to avoid leak - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/30fabe50a7ace3e9d57cf7f9288f33ea408491c8", "ref_desc": "tls: get psock ref after taking rxlock to avoid leak - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b565d294e3d5aa809566a4d819835da11997d8b3", "ref_desc": "tls: get psock ref after taking rxlock to avoid leak - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/417e91e856099e9b8a42a2520e2255e6afe024be", "ref_desc": "tls: get psock ref after taking rxlock to avoid leak - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
