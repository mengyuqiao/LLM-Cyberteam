{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35993", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: turn folio_test_hugetlb into a PageType\n\nThe current folio_test_hugetlb() can be fooled by a concurrent folio split\ninto returning true for a folio which has never belonged to hugetlbfs. \nThis can't happen if the caller holds a refcount on it, but we have a few\nplaces (memory-failure, compaction, procfs) which do not and should not\ntake a speculative reference.\n\nSince hugetlb pages do not use individual page mapcounts (they are always\nfully mapped and use the entire_mapcount field to record the number of\nmappings), the PageType field is available now that page_mapcount()\nignores the value in this field.\n\nIn compaction and with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled, the current implementation\ncan result in an oops, as reported by Luis. This happens since 9c5ccf2db04b\n(\"mm: remove HUGETLB_PAGE_DTOR\") effectively added some VM_BUG_ON() checks\nin the PageHuge() testing path.\n\n[willy@infradead.org: update vmcoreinfo]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/ZgGZUvsdhaT1Va-T@casper.infradead.org", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35993", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2431b5f2650dfc47ce782d1ca7b02d6b3916976f", "ref_desc": "mm: turn folio_test_hugetlb into a PageType - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9fdcc5b6359dfdaa52a55033bf50e2cedd66eb32", "ref_desc": "mm: turn folio_test_hugetlb into a PageType - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d99e3140a4d33e26066183ff727d8f02f56bec64", "ref_desc": "mm: turn folio_test_hugetlb into a PageType - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
