{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35223", "Description": "Dapr is a portable, event-driven, runtime for building distributed applications across cloud and edge. Dapr sends the app token of the invoker app instead of the app token of the invoked app. This causes of a leak of the application token of the invoker app to the invoked app when using Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation. This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who use Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation as well as the Dapr App API token functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the app token of the invoker app, potentially compromising security and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability was patched in version 1.13.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35223", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7344", "ref_desc": "dapr-api-token passed back to the application 'as-is' when proxying \u00b7 Issue #7344 \u00b7 dapr/dapr \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/7404", "ref_desc": "append app token to outgoing calls, if it is provided by vermillionsword \u00b7 Pull Request #7404 \u00b7 dapr/dapr \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/commit/e0591e43d0cdfd30a2f2960dce5d9892dc98bc2c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-284c-x8m7-9w5h \u00b7 dapr/dapr@e0591e4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.13.3", "ref_desc": "Release Dapr Runtime v1.13.3 \u00b7 dapr/dapr \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/security/advisories/GHSA-284c-x8m7-9w5h", "ref_desc": "Dapr API token CVE \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dapr/dapr \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
