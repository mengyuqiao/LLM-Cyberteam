{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36935", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated\n\nCurrently, we allocate a count-sized kernel buffer and copy count bytes\nfrom userspace to that buffer. Later, we use sscanf on this buffer but we\ndon't ensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead\nto OOB read when using sscanf. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul\ninstead of memdup_user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36935", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5ff4de981983ed84f29b5d92b6550ec054e12a92", "ref_desc": "ice: ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/666854ea9cad844f75a068f32812a2d78004914a", "ref_desc": "ice: ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
