{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34715", "Description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. The Fides webserver requires a connection to a hosted PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of application data. If the password used by the webserver for this database connection includes special characters such as `@` and `$`, webserver startup fails and the part of the password following the special character is exposed in webserver error logs. This is caused by improper escaping of the SQLAlchemy password string. As a result users are subject to a partial exposure of hosted database password in webserver logs. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.37.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34715", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-8cm5-jfj2-26q7", "ref_desc": "Hosted Database Password Partial Exposure Vulnerability in Fides Webserver Logs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/discussions/6615", "ref_desc": "postgres connection failing when password has a $ in it \u00b7 sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy \u00b7 Discussion #6615 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/6ab37b1ffe2b1a3bd35b706a82f78e061086141c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8cm5-jfj2-26q7 \u00b7 ethyca/fides@6ab37b1 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#escaping-special-characters-such-as-signs-in-passwords", "ref_desc": "Engine Configuration \u2014 SQLAlchemy 1.4 Documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
