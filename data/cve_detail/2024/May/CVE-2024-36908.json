{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36908", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined\n\nIn iocg_pay_debt(), warn is triggered if 'active_list' is empty, which\nis intended to confirm iocg is active when it has debt. However, warn\ncan be triggered during a blkcg or disk removal, if iocg_waitq_timer_fn()\nis run at that time:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2344971 at block/blk-iocost.c:1402 iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190\n  Call trace:\n  iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190\n  iocg_kick_waitq+0x438/0x4c0\n  iocg_waitq_timer_fn+0xd8/0x130\n  __run_hrtimer+0x144/0x45c\n  __hrtimer_run_queues+0x16c/0x244\n  hrtimer_interrupt+0x2cc/0x7b0\n\nThe warn in this situation is meaningless. Since this iocg is being\nremoved, the state of the 'active_list' is irrelevant, and 'waitq_timer'\nis canceled after removing 'active_list' in ioc_pd_free(), which ensures\niocg is freed after iocg_waitq_timer_fn() returns.\n\nTherefore, add the check if iocg was already offlined to avoid warn\nwhen removing a blkcg or disk.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36908", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/01bc4fda9ea0a6b52f12326486f07a4910666cf6", "ref_desc": "blk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/14b3275f93d4a0d8ddc02195bc4e9869b7a3700e", "ref_desc": "blk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c172ac7afe4442964f4153b2c78fe4e005d9d67", "ref_desc": "blk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
