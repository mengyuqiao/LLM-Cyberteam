{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34073", "Description": "sagemaker-python-sdk is a library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker. In affected versions the capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils` module allows for potentially unsafe Operating System (OS) Command Injection if inappropriate command is passed as the \u201crequirements_path\u201d parameter. This consequently may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, affecting both confidentiality and integrity. This issue has been addressed in version 2.214.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not override the \u201crequirements_path\u201d parameter of capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils`, and instead use the default value.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34073", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-7pc3-pr3q-58vg", "ref_desc": "GHSA for Command Injection in capture_dependencies \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aws/sagemaker-python-sdk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/4556", "ref_desc": "[Fix] Switch to subprocess in ModelBuilder when capturing dependencies by jiapinw \u00b7 Pull Request #4556 \u00b7 aws/sagemaker-python-sdk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/commit/2d873d53f708ea570fc2e2a6974f8c3097fe9df5", "ref_desc": "[Fix] Switch to subprocess in ModelBuilder when capturing dependencie\u2026 \u00b7 aws/sagemaker-python-sdk@2d873d5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
