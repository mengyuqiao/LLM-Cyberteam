{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34063", "Description": "vodozemac is an implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust. Versions 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 of vodozemac have degraded secret zeroization capabilities, due to changes in third-party cryptographic dependencies (the Dalek crates), which moved secret zeroization capabilities behind a feature flag and defaulted this feature to off. The degraded zeroization capabilities could result in the production of more memory copies of encryption secrets and secrets could linger in memory longer than necessary. This marginally increases the risk of sensitive data exposure. This issue has been addressed in version 0.6.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34063", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1188/Initialization-of-a-Resource-with-an-Insecure-Default.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/commit/297548cad4016ce448c4b5007c54db7ee39489d9", "ref_desc": "fix: Bump our dependencies and enable zeroization in the dalek crates \u00b7 matrix-org/vodozemac@297548c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/security/advisories/GHSA-c3hm-hxwf-g5c6", "ref_desc": "Degraded secret zeroization capabilities \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/vodozemac \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
