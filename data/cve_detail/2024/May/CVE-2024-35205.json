{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35205", "Description": "The WPS Office (aka cn.wps.moffice_eng) application before 17.0.0 for Android fails to properly sanitize file names before processing them through external application interactions, leading to a form of path traversal.

Successful exploitation could result in the execution of arbitrary commands under the guise of WPS Office's application ID.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35205", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "N/A", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/01/dirty-stream-attack-discovering-and-mitigating-a-common-vulnerability-pattern-in-android-apps/", "ref_desc": "\u201cDirty stream\u201d attack: Discovering and mitigating a common vulnerability pattern in Android apps | Microsoft Security Blog", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
