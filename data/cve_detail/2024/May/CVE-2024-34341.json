{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34341", "Description": "Trix is a rich text editor. The Trix editor, versions prior to 2.1.1, is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when copying and pasting content from the web or other documents with markup into the editor. The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of pasted content, allowing an attacker to embed malicious scripts which are executed within the context of the application. Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.1 or later, which incorporates proper sanitization of input from copied content.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34341", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/releases/tag/v2.1.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.1.1 \u00b7 basecamp/trix \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/security/advisories/GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99", "ref_desc": "XSS Vulnerabilities in Trix Editor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 basecamp/trix \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BKJQ4gdXGdFvOEW0aK0iJcqw8c0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/1147", "ref_desc": "Sanitize noscript to prevent copy and paste XSS by lewispb \u00b7 Pull Request #1147 \u00b7 basecamp/trix \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/commit/841ff19b53f349915100bca8fcb488214ff93554", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #1147 from basecamp/sanitize-noscript \u00b7 basecamp/trix@841ff19 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/commit/1a5c68a14d48421fc368e30026f4a7918028b7ad", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #1149 from basecamp/paste-html-sanitize \u00b7 basecamp/trix@1a5c68a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/1149", "ref_desc": "Sanitize HTML content in data-trix-* attributes by afcapel \u00b7 Pull Request #1149 \u00b7 basecamp/trix \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xY1Ov8LXxRwhWgPp2lp9kTTGY7g.html"}]}
