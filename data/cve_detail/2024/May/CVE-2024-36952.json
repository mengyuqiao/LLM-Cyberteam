{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36952", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up\n\nThere are cases after NPIV deletion where the fabric switch still believes\nthe NPIV is logged into the fabric.  This occurs when a vport is\nunregistered before the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the\nfabric.\n\nCurrently fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDs including\nthe fabric D_ID, removes the last ndlp reference and frees the ndlp rport\nobject.  This sometimes causes the race condition where the final DA_ID and\nLOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch.\n\nFix by moving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID\nand LOGO are sent.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36952", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f2c7f029051edc4b394bb48edbe2297575abefe0", "ref_desc": "scsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ddf01f2f1504fa08b766e8cfeec558e9f8eef6c", "ref_desc": "scsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/718602cd15f4c5710850090ea3066a89eeb46278", "ref_desc": "scsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0936809d968ecf81e0726fbd02ff2a5732d960c3", "ref_desc": "scsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/76337eb8daee32bcc67742efab3168ed4ca299d0", "ref_desc": "scsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
