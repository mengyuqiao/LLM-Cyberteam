{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35882", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP\n\nJan Schunk reports that his small NFS servers suffer from memory\nexhaustion after just a few days. A bisect shows that commit\ne18e157bb5c8 (\"SUNRPC: Send RPC message on TCP with a single\nsock_sendmsg() call\") is the first bad commit.\n\nThat commit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in\nthe underlying bio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't.\nsvc_xprt_release() releases the rqst's response pages, but the\nrecord marker page fragment isn't one of those, so it is never\nreleased.\n\nThis is a narrow fix that can be applied to stable kernels. A\nmore extensive fix is in the works.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35882", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ba1291172f935e6b6fe703161a948f3347400b8", "ref_desc": "SUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2ebedf7bcd17a1194a0a18122c885eb578ee882", "ref_desc": "SUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/05258a0a69b3c5d2c003f818702c0a52b6fea861", "ref_desc": "SUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
