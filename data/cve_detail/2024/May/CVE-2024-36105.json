{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36105", "Description": "dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications. Prior to versions 1.6.15, 1.7.15, and 1.8.1, Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. As stated in the Python docs, a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent to `\"0.0.0.0\"`. On systems with IPv6, '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to `\"::\"`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15, dbt-core v1.7.15, and dbt-core v1.8.1 by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36105", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1327 Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1327/Binding-to-an-Unrestricted-IP-Address.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.securesauce.dev/rules/PY030", "ref_desc": "socketserver \u2014 unrestricted bind | Precaution", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/commit/0c08d7a19ad1740be3cb0b2e6d9d64f6537176f7", "ref_desc": "change port bind and add a unittest (#10208) \u00b7 dbt-labs/dbt-core@0c08d7a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.7.15", "ref_desc": "Release dbt-core v1.7.15 \u00b7 dbt-labs/dbt-core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/core/dbt/task/docs/serve.py#L23C38-L23C39", "ref_desc": "dbt-core/core/dbt/task/docs/serve.py at main \u00b7 dbt-labs/dbt-core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket-families", "ref_desc": "socket \u2014 Low-level networking interface \u2014 Python 3.12.3 documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/security/advisories/GHSA-pmrx-695r-4349", "ref_desc": "Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address via socketsocket \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dbt-labs/dbt-core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/10209", "ref_desc": "Explicitly bind to localhost in docs serve \u00b7 Issue #10209 \u00b7 dbt-labs/dbt-core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1327.html", "ref_desc": "CWE - CWE-1327: Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address (4.14)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/pull/10208", "ref_desc": "change port bind and add a unittest by MichelleArk \u00b7 Pull Request #10208 \u00b7 dbt-labs/dbt-core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.8.1", "ref_desc": "Release dbt-core v1.8.1 \u00b7 dbt-labs/dbt-core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.6.15", "ref_desc": "Release dbt-core v1.6.15 \u00b7 dbt-labs/dbt-core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
