{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34081", "Description": "MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker.  Improper escaping of a custom field's name allows an attacker to inject HTML and, if CSP settings permit, achieve execution of arbitrary JavaScript when resolving or closing issues (`bug_change_status_page.php`) belonging to a project linking said custom field, viewing issues (`view_all_bug_page.php`) when the custom field is displayed as a column, or printing issues (`print_all_bug_page.php`) when the custom field is displayed as a column. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure Custom Field Names do not contain HTML tags.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34081", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/security/advisories/GHSA-wgx7-jp56-65mq", "ref_desc": "Cross-site scripting in Custom Field name \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mantisbt/mantisbt \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=34432", "ref_desc": "0034432: CVE-2024-34081: Unsanitised custom field names printed - MantisBT - Signup temporarily disabled due to spam", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/447a521aae0f82f791b8116a14a20e276df739be", "ref_desc": "Proper escaping of Custom Field name for display \u00b7 mantisbt/mantisbt@447a521 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
