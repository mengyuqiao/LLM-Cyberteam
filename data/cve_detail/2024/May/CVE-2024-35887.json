{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35887", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer\n\nWhen the ax25 device is detaching, the ax25_dev_device_down()\ncalls ax25_ds_del_timer() to cleanup the slave_timer. When\nthe timer handler is running, the ax25_ds_del_timer() that\ncalls del_timer() in it will return directly. As a result,\nthe use-after-free bugs could happen, one of the scenarios\nis shown below:\n\n      (Thread 1)          |      (Thread 2)\n                          | ax25_ds_timeout()\nax25_dev_device_down()    |\n  ax25_ds_del_timer()     |\n    del_timer()           |\n  ax25_dev_put() //FREE   |\n                          |  ax25_dev-> //USE\n\nIn order to mitigate bugs, when the device is detaching, use\ntimer_shutdown_sync() to stop the timer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35887", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/74204bf9050f7627aead9875fe4e07ba125cb19b", "ref_desc": "ax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fd819ad3ecf6f3c232a06b27423ce9ed8c20da89", "ref_desc": "ax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c6a368f9c7af4c14b14d390c2543af8001c9bdb9", "ref_desc": "ax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
