{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35183", "Description": "wolfictl is a command line tool for working with Wolfi. A git authentication issue in versions prior to 0.16.10 allows a local user\u2019s GitHub token to be sent to remote servers other than `github.com`. Most git-dependent functionality in wolfictl relies on its own `git` package, which contains centralized logic for implementing interactions with git repositories. Some of this functionality requires authentication in order to access private repositories. A central function `GetGitAuth` looks for a GitHub token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` and returns it as an HTTP basic auth object to be used with the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library. Most callers (direct or indirect) of `GetGitAuth` use the token to authenticate to github.com only; however, in some cases callers were passing this authentication without checking that the remote git repository was hosted on github.com. This behavior has existed in one form or another since commit 0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0 - committed January 25, 2023. This impacts anyone who ran the `wolfictl check update` commands with a Melange configuration that included a `git-checkout` directive step that referenced a git repository not hosted on github.com. This also impacts anyone who ran `wolfictl update <url>` with a remote URL outside of github.com. Additionally, these subcommands must have run with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable set to a valid GitHub token. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.10 to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35183", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/403e93569f46766b4e26e06cf9cd0cae5ee0c2a2", "ref_desc": "Git based commands, only use GITHUB_TOKEN when interacting with GitHu\u2026 \u00b7 wolfi-dev/wolfictl@403e935 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0", "ref_desc": "wolfictl update: use git auth when cloning melange config repo \u00b7 wolfi-dev/wolfictl@0d06e15 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/security/advisories/GHSA-8fg7-hp93-qhvr", "ref_desc": "GitHub token can be leaked to remote non-GitHub git servers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wolfi-dev/wolfictl \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/6d99909f7b1aa23f732d84dad054b02a61f530e6/pkg/git/git.go#L22", "ref_desc": "wolfictl/pkg/git/git.go at 6d99909f7b1aa23f732d84dad054b02a61f530e6 \u00b7 wolfi-dev/wolfictl \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/488b53823350caa706de3f01ec0eded9350c7da7/pkg/update/update.go#L143", "ref_desc": "wolfictl/pkg/update/update.go at 488b53823350caa706de3f01ec0eded9350c7da7 \u00b7 wolfi-dev/wolfictl \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/4dd6c95abb4bc0f9306350a8601057bd7a92bded/pkg/update/deps/cleanup.go#L49", "ref_desc": "wolfictl/pkg/update/deps/cleanup.go at 4dd6c95abb4bc0f9306350a8601057bd7a92bded \u00b7 wolfi-dev/wolfictl \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
