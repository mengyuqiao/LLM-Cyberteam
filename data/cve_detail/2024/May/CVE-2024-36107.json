{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36107", "Description": "MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. `If-Modified-Since` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers when used with anonymous requests by sending a random object name requests can be used to determine if an object exists or not on the server on a specific bucket and also gain access to some amount of\ninformation such as  `Last-Modified (of the latest version)`, `Etag (of the latest version)`, `x-amz-version-id (of the latest version)`, `Expires (metadata value of the latest version)`, `Cache-Control (metadata value of the latest version)`. This conditional check was being honored before validating if the anonymous access is indeed allowed on the metadata of an object. This issue has been addressed in commit `e0fe7cc3917`. Users must upgrade to RELEASE.2024-05-27T19-17-46Z for the fix. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36107", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/e0fe7cc391724fc5baa85b45508f425020fe4272", "ref_desc": "fix: information disclosure bug in preconditions GET (#19810) \u00b7 minio/minio@e0fe7cc \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-95fr-cm4m-q5p9", "ref_desc": "Information disclosure in GetObject with If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since headers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Unmodified-Since", "ref_desc": "If-Unmodified-Since - HTTP | MDN", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Modified-Since", "ref_desc": "If-Modified-Since - HTTP | MDN", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/19810", "ref_desc": "fix: information disclosure bug in preconditions GET by harshavardhana \u00b7 Pull Request #19810 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
