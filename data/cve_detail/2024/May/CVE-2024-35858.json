{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35858", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: bcmasp: fix memory leak when bringing down interface\n\nWhen bringing down the TX rings we flush the rings but forget to\nreclaimed the flushed packets. This leads to a memory leak since we\ndo not free the dma mapped buffers. This also leads to tx control\nblock corruption when bringing down the interface for power\nmanagement.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35858", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2389ad1990163d29cba5480d693b4c2e31cc545c", "ref_desc": "net: bcmasp: fix memory leak when bringing down interface - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f898fc2c31fbf0ac5ecd289f528a716464cb005", "ref_desc": "net: bcmasp: fix memory leak when bringing down interface - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09040baf8779ad880e0e0d0ea10e57aa929ef3ab", "ref_desc": "net: bcmasp: fix memory leak when bringing down interface - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
