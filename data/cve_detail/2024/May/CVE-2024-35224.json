{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35224", "Description": "OpenProject is the leading open source project management software. OpenProject utilizes `tablesorter` inside of the Cost Report feature. This dependency, when misconfigured, can lead to Stored XSS via `{icon}` substitution in table header values. This attack requires the permissions \"Edit work packages\" as well as \"Add attachments\". A project admin could attempt to escalate their privileges by sending this XSS to a System Admin. Otherwise, if a full System Admin is required, then this attack is significantly less impactful. By utilizing a ticket's attachment, you can store javascript in the application itself and bypass the application's CSP policy to achieve Stored XSS. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 14.1.0, 14.0.2 and 13.4.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35224", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://community.openproject.org/projects/openproject/work_packages/55198/relations", "ref_desc": "Bug: Improper escaping of custom field values in cost report (#55198) | OpenProject | OpenProject Community", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-h26c-j8wg-frjc", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in Cost Report Tables \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opf/openproject \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
