{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34080", "Description": "MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker. If an issue references a note that belongs to another issue that the user doesn't have access to, then it gets hyperlinked. Clicking on the link gives an access denied error as expected, yet some information remains available via the link, link label, and tooltip. This can result in disclosure of the existence of the note, the note author name, the note creation timestamp, and the issue id the note belongs to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34080", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/pull/2000", "ref_desc": "Fix access level check for note links by vboctor \u00b7 Pull Request #2000 \u00b7 mantisbt/mantisbt \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=34434", "ref_desc": "0034434: CVE-2024-34080: Don't hyperlink references to notes whose issues are not accessible to user - MantisBT - Signup temporarily disabled due to spam", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/security/advisories/GHSA-99jc-wqmr-ff2q", "ref_desc": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in MantisBT \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mantisbt/mantisbt \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/0a50562369d823689c9b946066d1e49d3c2df226", "ref_desc": "Fix access level check for note links \u00b7 mantisbt/mantisbt@0a50562 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
