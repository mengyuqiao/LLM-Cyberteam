{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35197", "Description": "gitoxide is a pure Rust implementation of Git. On Windows, fetching refs that clash with legacy device names reads from the devices, and checking out paths that clash with such names writes arbitrary data to the devices. This allows a repository, when cloned, to cause indefinite blocking or the production of arbitrary message that appear to have come from the application, and potentially other harmful effects under limited circumstances. If Windows is not used, or untrusted repositories are not cloned or otherwise used, then there is no impact. A minor degradation in availability may also be possible, such as with a very large file named `CON`, though the user could interrupt the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35197", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-67 Improper Handling of Windows Device Names", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/67/Improper-Handling-of-Windows-Device-Names.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9", "ref_desc": "Refs and paths with reserved Windows device names access the devices \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Byron/gitoxide \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
