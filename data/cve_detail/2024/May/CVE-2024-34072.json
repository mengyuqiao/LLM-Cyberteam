{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34072", "Description": "sagemaker-python-sdk is a library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker. The sagemaker.base_deserializers.NumpyDeserializer module before v2.218.0 allows potentially unsafe deserialization when untrusted data is passed as pickled object arrays. This consequently may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, affecting both confidentiality and integrity. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.218.0. Users unable to upgrade should not pass pickled numpy object arrays which originated from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with. Only pass pickled numpy object arrays from trusted sources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34072", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/4557", "ref_desc": "feature: set default allow_pickle param to False by akrishna1995 \u00b7 Pull Request #4557 \u00b7 aws/sagemaker-python-sdk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-wjvx-jhpj-r54r", "ref_desc": "GHSA for sagemaker.base_deserializers.NumpyDeserializer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aws/sagemaker-python-sdk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
