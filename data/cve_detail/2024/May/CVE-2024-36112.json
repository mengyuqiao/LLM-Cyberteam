{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36112", "Description": "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A user with permissions to view Dynamic Group records (`extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission) can use the Dynamic Group detail UI view (`/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/`) and/or the members REST API view (`/api/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/members/`) to list the objects that are members of a given Dynamic Group. In versions of Nautobot between 1.3.0 (where the Dynamic Groups feature was added) and 1.6.22 inclusive, and 2.0.0 through 2.2.4 inclusive, Nautobot fails to restrict these listings based on the member object permissions - for example a Dynamic Group of Device objects will list all Devices that it contains, regardless of the user's `dcim.view_device` permissions or lack thereof. This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.23 and 2.2.5. Users are advised to upgrade. This vulnerability can be partially mitigated by removing `extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission from users however a full fix will require upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36112", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-280 Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/280/Improper-Handling-of-Insufficient-Permissions-or-Privileges-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5757", "ref_desc": "Dynamic group permissions improvements by glennmatthews \u00b7 Pull Request #5757 \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5762", "ref_desc": "[LTM] Dynamic groups permissions improvements by glennmatthews \u00b7 Pull Request #5762 \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-qmjf-wc2h-6x3q", "ref_desc": "Nautobot dynamic-group-members UI and REST API doesn't enforce permission restrictions on member objects \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
