{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35221", "Description": "Rubygems.org is the Ruby community's gem hosting service. A Gem publisher can cause a Remote DoS when publishing a Gem. This is due to how Ruby reads the Manifest of Gem files when using Gem::Specification.from_yaml. from_yaml makes use of SafeYAML.load which allows YAML aliases inside the YAML-based metadata of a gem. YAML aliases allow for Denial of Service attacks with so-called `YAML-bombs` (comparable to Billion laughs attacks). This was patched. There is is no action required by users. This issue is also tracked as GHSL-2024-001 and was discovered by the GitHub security lab.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35221", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack", "ref_desc": "Billion laughs attack - Wikipedia", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/7cf74a2ff28b1b4c26e367d0d67521f7e1fed239/lib/rubygems/safe_yaml.rb#L28", "ref_desc": "ruby/lib/rubygems/safe_yaml.rb at 7cf74a2ff28b1b4c26e367d0d67521f7e1fed239 \u00b7 ruby/ruby \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/security/advisories/GHSA-4vc5-whwr-7hh2", "ref_desc": "Remote DoS when publishing a package \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rubygems/rubygems.org \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
