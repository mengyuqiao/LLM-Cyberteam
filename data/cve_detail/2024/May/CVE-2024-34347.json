{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34347", "Description": "@hoppscotch/cli is a CLI to run Hoppscotch Test Scripts in CI environments. Prior to 0.8.0, the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However, the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox, multiple references to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34347", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/commit/22c6eabd133195d22874250a5ae40cb26b851b01", "ref_desc": "chore: migrate `Node.js` implementation for `js-sandbox` to `isolated\u2026 \u00b7 hoppscotch/hoppscotch@22c6eab \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/security/advisories/GHSA-qmmm-73r2-f8xr", "ref_desc": "Sandbox Escape in @hoppscotch/js-sandbox leads to RCE \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hoppscotch/hoppscotch \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
