{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32973", "Description": "Pluto is a superset of Lua 5.4 with a focus on general-purpose programming. In affected versions an attacker with the ability to actively intercept network traffic would be able to use a specifically-crafted certificate to fool Pluto into trusting it to be the intended remote for the TLS session. This results in the HTTP library and socket.starttls providing less transport integrity than expected. This issue has been patched in pull request #851 which has been included in version 0.9.3. Users are advised to upgrade. there are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32973", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PlutoLang/Pluto/security/advisories/GHSA-84hj-7j2v-w665", "ref_desc": "Remote for TLS session may be trusted despite constraints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PlutoLang/Pluto \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PlutoLang/Pluto/pull/851", "ref_desc": "Update Soup by Sainan \u00b7 Pull Request #851 \u00b7 PlutoLang/Pluto \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
