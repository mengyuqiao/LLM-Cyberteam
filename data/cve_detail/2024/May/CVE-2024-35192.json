{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35192", "Description": "Trivy is a security scanner. Prior to 0.51.2, if a malicious actor is able to trigger Trivy to scan container images from a crafted malicious registry, it could result in the leakage of credentials for legitimate registries such as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Cloud Artifact/Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry (ACR). These tokens can then be used to push/pull images from those registries to which the identity/user running Trivy has access. Systems are not affected if the default credential provider chain is unable to obtain valid credentials. This vulnerability only applies when scanning container images directly from a registry. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.51.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35192", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/security/advisories/GHSA-xcq4-m2r3-cmrj", "ref_desc": "Possible registry credential leakage when scanning images from malicious registries \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aquasecurity/trivy \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/commit/e7f14f729de259551203f313e57d2d9d3aa2ff87", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xcq4-m2r3-cmrj \u00b7 aquasecurity/trivy@e7f14f7 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
