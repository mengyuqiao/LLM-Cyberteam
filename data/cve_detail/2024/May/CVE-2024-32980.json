{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32980", "Description": "Spin is the developer tool for building and running serverless applications powered by WebAssembly. Prior to 2.4.3, some specifically configured Spin applications that use `self` requests without a specified URL authority can be induced to make requests to arbitrary hosts via the `Host` HTTP header. The following conditions need to be met for an application to be vulnerable: 1. The environment Spin is deployed in routes requests to the Spin runtime based on the request URL instead of the `Host` header, and leaves the `Host` header set to its original value; 2. The Spin application's component handling the incoming request is configured with an `allow_outbound_hosts` list containing `\"self\"`; and 3. In reaction to an incoming request, the component makes an outbound request whose URL doesn't include the hostname/port. Spin 2.4.3 has been released to fix this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32980", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fermyon/spin/security/advisories/GHSA-f3h7-gpjj-wcvh", "ref_desc": "Potential network sandbox escape for specifically configured Spin applications \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fermyon/spin \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fermyon/spin/commit/b3db535c9edb72278d4db3a201f0ed214e561354", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-f3h7-gpjj-wcvh \u00b7 fermyon/spin@b3db535 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
