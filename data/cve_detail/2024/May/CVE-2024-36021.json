{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36021", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hns3: fix kernel crash when devlink reload during pf initialization\n\nThe devlink reload process will access the hardware resources,\nbut the register operation is done before the hardware is initialized.\nSo, processing the devlink reload during initialization may lead to kernel\ncrash. This patch fixes this by taking devl_lock during initialization.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36021", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1b550dae55901c2cc9075d6a7155a71b4f516e86", "ref_desc": "net: hns3: fix kernel crash when devlink reload during pf initialization - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7ca0f73e5e2da3c129935b97f3a0877cce8ebdf5", "ref_desc": "net: hns3: fix kernel crash when devlink reload during pf initialization - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/93305b77ffcb042f1538ecc383505e87d95aa05a", "ref_desc": "net: hns3: fix kernel crash when devlink reload during pf initialization - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50b69054f455dcdb34bd6b22764c7579b270eef3", "ref_desc": "net: hns3: fix kernel crash when devlink reload during pf initialization - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
