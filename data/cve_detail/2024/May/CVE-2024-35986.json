{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35986", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered\n\nThe power_supply frame-work is not really designed for there to be\nlong living in kernel references to power_supply devices.\n\nSpecifically unregistering a power_supply while some other code has\na reference to it triggers a WARN in power_supply_unregister():\n\n\tWARN_ON(atomic_dec_return(&psy->use_cnt));\n\nFolllowed by the power_supply still getting removed and the\nbacking data freed anyway, leaving the tusb1210 charger-detect code\nwith a dangling reference, resulting in a crash the next time\ntusb1210_get_online() is called.\n\nFix this by only holding the reference in tusb1210_get_online()\nfreeing it at the end of the function. Note this still leaves\na theoretical race window, but it avoids the issue when manually\nrmmod-ing the charger chip driver during development.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35986", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bf6e4ee5c43690e4c5a8a057bbcd4ff986bed052", "ref_desc": "phy: ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9827caa5105fb16d1fae2e75c8d0e4662014b3ca", "ref_desc": "phy: ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/73224a5d2180066c7fe05b4656647601ba08d588", "ref_desc": "phy: ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/25b3498485ac281e5851700e33b97f12c9533fd8", "ref_desc": "phy: ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
