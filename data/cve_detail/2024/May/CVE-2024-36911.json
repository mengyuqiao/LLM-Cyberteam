{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36911", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhv_netvsc: Don't free decrypted memory\n\nIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause\nset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an\nerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to\ntake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)\nmemory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security\nissues.\n\nThe netvsc driver could free decrypted/shared pages if\nset_memory_decrypted() fails. Check the decrypted field in the gpadl\nto decide whether to free the memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36911", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a56fe611326332bf6b7126e5559590c57dcebad4", "ref_desc": "hv_netvsc: Don't free decrypted memory - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bbf9ac34677b57506a13682b31a2a718934c0e31", "ref_desc": "hv_netvsc: Don't free decrypted memory - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4aaed9dbe8acd2b6114458f0498a617283d6275b", "ref_desc": "hv_netvsc: Don't free decrypted memory - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
