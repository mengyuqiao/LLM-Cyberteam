{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36887", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ne1000e: change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access\n\nThis is a partial revert of commit 6dbdd4de0362 (\"e1000e: Workaround\nfor sporadic MDI error on Meteor Lake systems\"). The referenced commit\nused usleep_range inside the PHY access routines, which are sometimes\ncalled from an atomic context. This can lead to a kernel panic in some\nscenarios, such as cable disconnection and reconnection on vPro systems.\n\nSolve this by changing the usleep_range calls back to udelay.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36887", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/950d5226cd6bb83ba720961a8d4d5cf79e6afd57", "ref_desc": "e1000e: change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f8a139656c95db893a543159873c57a470d7376d", "ref_desc": "e1000e: change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/387f295cb2150ed164905b648d76dfcbd3621778", "ref_desc": "e1000e: change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
