The affected application does not properly limit the size of specific logs. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to exhaust system resources by creating a great number of log entries which could potentially lead to a denial of service condition. A successful exploitation requires the attacker to have access to specific SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager Clients in the deployment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33495", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-093430.html", "ref_desc": "SSA-093430CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VHjQuDKxv6eKI2Vd_lZWcR2SErY.html"}]}
