{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34360", "Description": "go-spacemesh is a Go implementation of the Spacemesh protocol full node. Nodes can publish activations transactions (ATXs) which reference the incorrect previous ATX of the Smesher that created the ATX. ATXs are expected to form a single chain from the newest to the first ATX ever published by an identity. Allowing Smeshers to reference an earlier (but not the latest) ATX as previous breaks this protocol rule and can serve as an attack vector where Nodes are rewarded for holding their PoST data for less than one epoch but still being eligible for rewards. This vulnerability is fixed in go-spacemesh 1.5.2-hotfix1 and Spacemesh API 1.37.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34360", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/commit/9aff88d54be809ac43d60e8a8b4d65359c356b87", "ref_desc": "Verify that previous ATX points to correct ATX when handling incoming\u2026 \u00b7 spacemeshos/go-spacemesh@9aff88d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/spacemeshos/api/commit/1d5bd972bbe225d024c3e0ae5214ddb6b481716e", "ref_desc": "Add malfeasance type for incorrect previous ATX (#2) \u00b7 spacemeshos/api@1d5bd97 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/security/advisories/GHSA-jcqq-g64v-gcm7", "ref_desc": "Previous ATX is not checked to be the newest valid ATX by Smesher when validating incoming ATX \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 spacemeshos/go-spacemesh \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
