{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36881", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/userfaultfd: reset ptes when close() for wr-protected ones\n\nUserfaultfd unregister includes a step to remove wr-protect bits from all\nthe relevant pgtable entries, but that only covered an explicit\nUFFDIO_UNREGISTER ioctl, not a close() on the userfaultfd itself.  Cover\nthat too.  This fixes a WARN trace.\n\nThe only user visible side effect is the user can observe leftover\nwr-protect bits even if the user close()ed on an userfaultfd when\nreleasing the last reference of it.  However hopefully that should be\nharmless, and nothing bad should happen even if so.\n\nThis change is now more important after the recent page-table-check\npatch we merged in mm-unstable (446dd9ad37d0 (\"mm/page_table_check:\nsupport userfault wr-protect entries\")), as we'll do sanity check on\nuffd-wp bits without vma context.  So it's better if we can 100%\nguarantee no uffd-wp bit leftovers, to make sure each report will be\nvalid.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36881", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c88033efe9a391e72ba6b5df4b01d6e628f4e734", "ref_desc": "mm/userfaultfd: reset ptes when close() for wr-protected ones - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/377f3a9a3d032a52325a5b110379a25dd1ab1931", "ref_desc": "mm/userfaultfd: reset ptes when close() for wr-protected ones - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d8b68a5b0c9fb23d37df06bb273ead38fd5a29d", "ref_desc": "mm/userfaultfd: reset ptes when close() for wr-protected ones - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
