{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32888", "Description": "The Amazon JDBC Driver for Redshift is a Type 4 JDBC driver that provides database connectivity through the standard JDBC application program interfaces (APIs) available in the Java Platform, Enterprise Editions. Prior to version 2.1.0.28, SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value. There is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected. This issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28. As a workaround, do not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`. (NOTE: Those who do not explicitly specify a query mode use the default of extended query mode and are not affected by this issue.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32888", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Fp0pl7Fah1EJqQgm1xb-gkpi4q4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver/commit/0d354a5f26ca23f7cac4e800e3b8734220230319", "ref_desc": "Update CHANGELOG.md for version 2.1.0.28 \u00b7 aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver@0d354a5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver/commit/bc93694201a291493778ce5369a72befeca5ba7d", "ref_desc": "Security improvements. \u00b7 aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver@bc93694 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver/commit/12a5e8ecfbb44c8154fc66041cca2e20ecd7b339", "ref_desc": "More security improvements. \u00b7 aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver@12a5e8e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver/security/advisories/GHSA-x3wm-hffr-chwm", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection via line comment generation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
