{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36896", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal\n\nTesting with KASAN and syzkaller revealed a bug in port.c:disable_store():\nusb_hub_to_struct_hub() can return NULL if the hub that the port belongs to\nis concurrently removed, but the function does not check for this\npossibility before dereferencing the returned value.\n\nIt turns out that the first dereference is unnecessary, since hub->intfdev\nis the parent of the port device, so it can be changed easily.  Adding a\ncheck for hub == NULL prevents further problems.\n\nThe same bug exists in the disable_show() routine, and it can be fixed the\nsame way.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36896", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f1d68ef5ddac27c6b997adccd1c339cef1e6848", "ref_desc": "USB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/63533549ff53d24daf47c443dbd43c308afc3434", "ref_desc": "USB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6119ef6517ce501fc548154691abdaf1f954a277", "ref_desc": "USB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a4b46d450c49f32e9d4247b421e58083fde304ce", "ref_desc": "USB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
