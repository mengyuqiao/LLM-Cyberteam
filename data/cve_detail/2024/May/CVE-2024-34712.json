{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34712", "Description": "Oceanic is a NodeJS library for interfacing with Discord. Prior to version 1.10.4, input to functions such as `Client.rest.channels.removeBan` is not url-encoded, resulting in specially crafted input such as `../../../channels/{id}` being normalized into the url `/api/v10/channels/{id}`, and deleting a channel rather than removing a ban. Version 1.10.4 fixes this issue. Some workarounds are available. One may sanitize user input, ensuring strings are valid for the purpose they are being used for. One may also encode input with `encodeURIComponent` before providing it to the library.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34712", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OceanicJS/Oceanic/security/advisories/GHSA-5h5v-hw44-f6gg", "ref_desc": "Unsanitized user input can lead to path traversal in URLs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OceanicJS/Oceanic \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OceanicJS/Oceanic/commit/8bf8ee8373b8c565fbdbf70a609aba4fbc1a1ffe", "ref_desc": "sanitize route parameters \u00b7 OceanicJS/Oceanic@8bf8ee8 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
