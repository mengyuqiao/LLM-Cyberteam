{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35194", "Description": "Minder is a software supply chain security platform. Prior to version 0.0.50, Minder engine is susceptible to a denial of service from memory exhaustion that can be triggered from maliciously created templates. Minder engine uses templating to generate strings for various use cases such as URLs, messages for pull requests, descriptions for advisories. In some cases can the user control both the template and the params for it, and in a subset of these cases, Minder reads the generated template entirely into memory. When Minders templating meets both of these conditions, an attacker is able to generate large enough templates that Minder will exhaust memory and crash. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.50.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35194", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/security/advisories/GHSA-crgc-2583-rw27", "ref_desc": "Denial of service from maliciously crafted templates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 stacklok/minder \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/fe321d345b4f738de6a06b13207addc72b59f892", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8fmj-33gw-g7pw \u00b7 stacklok/minder@fe321d3 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Q0bErqldCIp2ujHb7cWmmhjffKA.html"}]}
