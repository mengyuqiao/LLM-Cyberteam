{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34359", "Description": "llama-cpp-python is the Python bindings for llama.cpp. `llama-cpp-python` depends on class `Llama` in `llama.py` to load `.gguf` llama.cpp or Latency Machine Learning Models. The `__init__` constructor built in the `Llama` takes several parameters to configure the loading and running of the model. Other than `NUMA, LoRa settings`, `loading tokenizers,` and `hardware settings`, `__init__` also loads the `chat template` from targeted `.gguf` 's Metadata and furtherly parses it to `llama_chat_format.Jinja2ChatFormatter.to_chat_handler()` to construct the `self.chat_handler` for this model. Nevertheless, `Jinja2ChatFormatter` parse the `chat template` within the Metadate with sandbox-less `jinja2.Environment`, which is furthermore rendered in `__call__` to construct the `prompt` of interaction. This allows `jinja2` Server Side Template Injection which leads to remote code execution by a carefully constructed payload.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34359", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-76 Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/76/Improper-Neutralization-of-Equivalent-Special-Elements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/security/advisories/GHSA-56xg-wfcc-g829", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution by Server-Side Template Injection in Model Metadata \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 abetlen/llama-cpp-python \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/commit/b454f40a9a1787b2b5659cd2cb00819d983185df", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-56xg-wfcc-g829 \u00b7 abetlen/llama-cpp-python@b454f40 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
