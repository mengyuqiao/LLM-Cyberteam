{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34397", "Description": "An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.78.5, and 2.79.x and 2.80.x before 2.80.1. When a GDBus-based client subscribes to signals from a trusted system service such as NetworkManager on a shared computer, other users of the same computer can send spoofed D-Bus signals that the GDBus-based client will wrongly interpret as having been sent by the trusted system service. This could lead to the GDBus-based client behaving incorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34397", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-11  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/07/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - GLib (2.26.0+): GDBus signal subscriptions for well-known names are vulnerable to unicast spoofing", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LL6HSJDXCXMLEIJBYV6CPOR4K2NTCTXW/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: gnome-shell-45.6-2.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0008/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-34397 Gnome Glib Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00008.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3814-1] glib2.0 security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LCDY3KA7G7D3DRXYTT46K6LFHS2KHWBH/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: glib2-2.80.2-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IRSFYAE5X23TNRWX7ZWEJOMISLCDSYNS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: mingw-glib2-2.78.5-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UNFJHISR4O6VFOHBFWH5I5WWMG37H63A/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: mingw-glib2-2.80.1-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3268", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-34397: GDBus signal subscriptions for well-known names are vulnerable to unicast spoofing (#3268) \u00b7 Issues \u00b7 GNOME / GLib \u00b7 GitLab", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
