{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35219", "Description": "OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. Prior to version 7.6.0, attackers can exploit a path traversal vulnerability to read and delete files and folders from an arbitrary, writable directory as anyone can set the output folder when submitting the request via the `outputFolder` option. The issue was fixed in version 7.6.0 by removing the usage of the `outputFolder` option. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35219", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-13  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/security/advisories/GHSA-g3hr-p86p-593h", "ref_desc": "OpenAPI Generator Online - Arbitrary File Read/Delete \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenAPITools/openapi-generator \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/18652", "ref_desc": "Skip setting output folder in online service by wing328 \u00b7 Pull Request #18652 \u00b7 OpenAPITools/openapi-generator \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/edbb021aadae47dcfe690313ce5119faf77f800d", "ref_desc": "skip setting output folder in online service (#18652) \u00b7 OpenAPITools/openapi-generator@edbb021 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
