{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34069", "Description": "Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34069", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/H4SH32AM3CTPMAAEOIDAN7VU565LO4IR/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: mingw-python-werkzeug-2.2.3-2.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-2g68-c3qc-8985", "ref_desc": "Werkzeug debugger vulnerable to remote execution when interacting with attacker controlled domain \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pallets/werkzeug \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HFERFN7PINV4MOGMGA3DPIXJPDCYOEJZ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: mingw-python-werkzeug-3.0.3-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240614-0004/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-34069 Werkzeug Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/3386395b24c7371db11a5b8eaac0c91da5362692", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2g68-c3qc-8985 \u00b7 pallets/werkzeug@3386395 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
