{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21630", "Description": "Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. A vulnerability in version 8.0 is similar to CVE-2023-32677, but applies to multi-use invitations, not single-use invitation links as in the prior CVE. Specifically, it applies when the installation has configured non-admins to be able to invite users and create multi-use invitations, and has also configured only admins to be able to invite users to streams. As in CVE-2023-32677, this does not let users invite new users to arbitrary streams, only to streams that the inviter can already see. Version 8.1 fixes this issue. As a workaround, administrators can limit sending of invitations down to users who also have the permission to add users to streams.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21630", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulip ServerVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.0andbefore (<) 6.2cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZulip\u00bbZulip ServerVersions  from including (>=) 8.0andbefore (<) 8.1cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-87p9-wprh-7rm6", "ref_desc": "Non-admins can invite new users to streams they would not otherwise be able to add existing users to \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://zulip.com/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations", "ref_desc": "Restrict account creation | Zulip help centerProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BQW5F5-9JFuGHTZ037fqGNz0r0c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams", "ref_desc": "Restrict stream invitation | Zulip help centerProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FmpT5zaPlTWkA9iBo9Xz9QfdbIM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/0df7bd71f32f3b772e2646c6ab0d60c9b610addf", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-21630: Check permission to subscribe others using invite link. \u00b7 zulip/zulip@0df7bd7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-mrvp-96q6-jpvc", "ref_desc": "Users who can send invitations can add users to streams during invitation, even if they cannot add users to streams at other times \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YmXBvwM-5pGp9v4ngFTb7AN5X8Y.html"}]}
