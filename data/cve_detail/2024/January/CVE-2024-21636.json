{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21636", "Description": "view_component is a framework for building reusable, testable, and encapsulated view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define a `#call` method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content. In addition, the return value of the `#output_postamble` methodis not sanitized, which can also lead to cross-site scripting issues. Versions 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have been released and fully mitigate both the `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities. As a workaround, sanitize the return value of `#call`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21636", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nViewcomponent\u00bbView Component\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 2.83.0cpe:2.3:a:viewcomponent:view_component:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nViewcomponent\u00bbView Component\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.9.0cpe:2.3:a:viewcomponent:view_component:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/0d26944a8d2730ea40e60eae23d70684483e5017", "ref_desc": "Ensure HTML output safety (#1950) \u00b7 ViewComponent/view_component@0d26944 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in view_component \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ViewComponent/view_component \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/c43d8bafa7117cbce479669a423ab266de150697", "ref_desc": "Backport HTML safety fix for 2.x (#1962) \u00b7 ViewComponent/view_component@c43d8ba \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/pull/1962", "ref_desc": "Backport HTML safety fix for 2.x by camertron \u00b7 Pull Request #1962 \u00b7 ViewComponent/view_component \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/pull/1950", "ref_desc": "Ensure HTML output safety by camertron \u00b7 Pull Request #1950 \u00b7 ViewComponent/view_component \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
