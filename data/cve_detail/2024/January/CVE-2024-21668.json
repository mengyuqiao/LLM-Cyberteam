{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21668", "Description": "react-native-mmkv is a library that allows easy use of MMKV inside React Native applications. Before version 2.11.0, the react-native-mmkv logged the optional encryption key for the MMKV database into the Android system log. The key can be obtained by anyone with access to the Android Debugging Bridge (ADB) if it is enabled in the phone settings. This bug is not present on iOS devices. By logging the encryption secret to the system logs, attackers can trivially recover the secret by enabling ADB and undermining an app's thread model. This issue has been patched in version 2.11.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21668", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMrousavy\u00bbReact-native-mmkv\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.11.0cpe:2.3:a:mrousavy:react-native-mmkv:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv/releases/tag/v2.11.0", "ref_desc": "Release Release 2.11.0 \u00b7 mrousavy/react-native-mmkv \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv/security/advisories/GHSA-4jh3-6jhv-2mgp", "ref_desc": "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File in react-native-mmkv \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mrousavy/react-native-mmkv \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv/commit/a8995ccb7184281f7d168bad3e9987c9bd05f00d", "ref_desc": "fix: Don't leak encryption key in logs \u00b7 mrousavy/react-native-mmkv@a8995cc \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
