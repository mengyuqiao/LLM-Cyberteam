{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24567", "Description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. Vyper compiler allows passing a value in builtin raw_call even if the call is a delegatecall or a staticcall. But in the context of delegatecall and staticcall the handling of value is not possible due to the semantics of the respective opcodes, and vyper will silently ignore the value= argument. If the semantics of the EVM are unknown to the developer, he could suspect that by specifying the `value` kwarg, exactly the given amount will be sent along to the target. This vulnerability affects 0.3.10 and earlier versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24567", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyper\u00bbForPythonVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.3.10cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/9136169468f317a53b4e7448389aa315f90b95ba/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L1100", "ref_desc": "vyper/vyper/builtins/functions.py at 9136169468f317a53b4e7448389aa315f90b95ba \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-x2c2-q32w-4w6m", "ref_desc": "raw_call `value=` kwargs not disabled for static and delegate calls \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
