{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23636", "Description": "SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. SOFARPC defaults to using the SOFA Hessian protocol to deserialize received data, while the SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But, prior to version 5.12.0, there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. Version 5.12.0 fixed this issue by adding a blacklist. SOFARPC also provides a way to add additional blacklists. Users can add a class like `-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=org.apache.xpath.` to avoid this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23636", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSofastack\u00bbSofarpcVersions  before (<) 5.12.0cpe:2.3:a:sofastack:sofarpc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-02  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/commit/42d19b1b1d14a25aafd9ef7c219c04a19f90fc76", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7q8p-9953-pxvr \u00b7 sofastack/sofa-rpc@42d19b1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/security/advisories/GHSA-7q8p-9953-pxvr", "ref_desc": "Remote Command Execution(RCE) Vulnerbility \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sofastack/sofa-rpc \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
