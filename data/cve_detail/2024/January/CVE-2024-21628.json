{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21628", "Description": "PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. Prior to version 8.1.3, the isCleanHtml method is not used on this this form, which makes it possible to store a cross-site scripting payload in the database. The impact is low because the HTML is not interpreted in BO, thanks to twig's escape mechanism. In FO, the cross-site scripting attack is effective, but only impacts the customer sending it, or the customer session from which it was sent. This issue affects those who have a module fetching these messages from the DB and displaying it without escaping HTML. Version 8.1.3 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21628", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPrestashop\u00bbPrestashopVersions  before (<) 8.1.3cpe:2.3:a:prestashop:prestashop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-vr7m-r9vm-m4wf", "ref_desc": "XSS can be stored in DB from \"add a message form\" in order detail page (FO) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/c3d78b7e49f5fe49a9d07725c3174d005deaa597", "ref_desc": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'm4wf/advisory-fix-1' into 8.1.x \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop@c3d78b7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
