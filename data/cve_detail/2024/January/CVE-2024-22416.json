{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22416", "Description": "pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. As a result any API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user. This issue has been addressed in release `0.5.0b3.dev78`. All users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22416", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nPyload-ng Project\u00bbPyload-ng\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 0.5.0b3.dev78cpe:2.3:a:pyload-ng_project:pyload-ng:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-07  0.07%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-01  0.13%  0.07%  -0.07 \n 3  2024-02-09  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 4  2024-01-30  0.05%  0.14%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/1374c824271cb7e927740664d06d2e577624ca3e", "ref_desc": "fix GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm security advisory (2) \u00b7 pyload/pyload@1374c82 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on any API call leading to admin privilege escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pyload/pyload \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/c7cdc18ad9134a75222974b39e8b427c4af845fc", "ref_desc": "fix GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm security advisory \u00b7 pyload/pyload@c7cdc18 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
