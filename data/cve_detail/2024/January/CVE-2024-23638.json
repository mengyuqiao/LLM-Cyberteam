{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23638", "Description": "Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an expired pointer reference bug, Squid prior to version 6.6 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Cache Manager error responses. This problem allows a trusted client to perform Denial of Service when generating error pages for Client Manager reports. Squid older than 5.0.5 have not been tested and should be assumed to be vulnerable. All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.9 are vulnerable. All Squid-6.x up to and including 6.5 are vulnerable. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. As a workaround, prevent access to Cache Manager using Squid's main access control: `http_access deny manager`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23638", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSquid-cache\u00bbSquidVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.6cpe:2.3:a:squid-cache:squid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSquid-cache\u00bbSquidVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.9cpe:2.3:a:squid-cache:squid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.86% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-25  0.81%  0.86%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-02-09  0.43%  0.81%  +0.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-672 Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/672/Operation-on-a-Resource-after-Expiration-or-Release.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-825 Expired Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/825/Expired-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/stream-assert.html", "ref_desc": "Implicit Assertion in Stream Handling | Squid-Security-AuditExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/e8118a7381213f5cfcdeb4cec1d2d854bfd261c8", "ref_desc": "6.6 (#1615) \u00b7 squid-cache/squid@e8118a7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-j49p-553x-48rx", "ref_desc": "SQUID-2023:11 Denial of Service in Cache Manager \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 squid-cache/squid \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2023_11.patch", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XWQHRDRHDM5PQTU6BHH4C5KGL37X6TVI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: squid-6.9-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NBE-DwDPoD9lxtOKAEI7iXJgDN0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7R4KPSO3MQT3KAOZV7LC2GG3CYMCGK7H/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: squid-6.9-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/okZKI91Wv_jBFB5Sexm_tFK0GRA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240208-0010/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-23638 Squid Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/SQUID-2023_11.patch", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/290ae202883ac28a48867079c2fb34c40efd382b", "ref_desc": "Just close after a write(2) response sending error (#1582) \u00b7 squid-cache/squid@290ae20 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
