{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21647", "Description": "Puma is a web server for Ruby/Rack applications built for parallelism. Prior to version 6.4.2, puma exhibited incorrect behavior when parsing chunked transfer encoding bodies in a way that allowed HTTP request smuggling. Fixed versions limits the size of chunk extensions. Without this limit, an attacker could cause unbounded resource (CPU, network bandwidth) consumption. This vulnerability has been fixed in versions 6.4.2 and 5.6.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21647", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.4.2cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 5.6.8cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/5fc43d73b6ff193325e657a24ed76dec79133e93", "ref_desc": "5.6.8 and 6.4.2 \u00b7 puma/puma@5fc43d7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-c2f4-cvqm-65w2", "ref_desc": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling') in puma \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 puma/puma \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
