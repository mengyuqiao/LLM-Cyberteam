{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-20270", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Cisco BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-20270", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Xtended Services PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.2023.01andbefore (<) 24.0.2023.10cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_xtended_services_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Xtended Services PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.2023.01andbefore (<) 25.0.2023.10cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_xtended_services_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Xtended Services Platform\u00bbVersion:23.0.2024.01cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_xtended_services_platform:23.0.2024.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Application Delivery PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.2023.01andbefore (<) 25.0.2023.10cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_application_delivery_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Application Delivery PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.2023.01andbefore (<) 24.0.2023.10cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_application_delivery_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Application Delivery Platform\u00bbVersion:23.0.2024.01cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_application_delivery_platform:23.0.2024.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-broadworks-xss-6syj82Ju", "ref_desc": "Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Xtended Services Platform Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
