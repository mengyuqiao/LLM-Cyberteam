{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22409", "Description": "DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In affected versions a low privileged user could remove a user, edit group members, or edit another user's profile information. The default privileges gave too many broad permissions to low privileged users. These have been constrained in PR #9067 to prevent abuse. This issue can result in privilege escalation for lower privileged users up to admin privileges, potentially, if a group with admin privileges exists. May not impact instances that have modified default privileges. This issue has been addressed in datahub version 0.12.1. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22409", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDatahub Project\u00bbDatahubVersions  before (<) 0.12.1cpe:2.3:a:datahub_project:datahub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/pull/9067", "ref_desc": "feat(policies): reduce default access for all users by RyanHolstien \u00b7 Pull Request #9067 \u00b7 datahub-project/datahub \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-x3v6-r479-m4xv", "ref_desc": "Default Privileges allow for high level operations for low privileged users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 datahub-project/datahub \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
