Installations of jupyter-lsp running in environments without configured file system access control (on the operating system level), and with jupyter-server instances exposed to non-trusted network are vulnerable to unauthorised access and modification of file system beyond the jupyter root directory. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should uninstall jupyter-lsp.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22415", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbLanguage Server Protocol Integration\u00bbForJupyterVersions  before (<) 2.2.2cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:language_server_protocol_integration:*:*:*:*:*:jupyter:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-31  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-lsp/jupyterlab-lsp/commit/4ad12f204ad0b85580fc32137c647baaff044e95", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-4qhp-652w-c22x \u00b7 jupyter-lsp/jupyterlab-lsp@4ad12f2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-lsp/jupyterlab-lsp/security/advisories/GHSA-4qhp-652w-c22x", "ref_desc": "Missing authentication for jupyter-lsp server extension endpoints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyter-lsp/jupyterlab-lsp \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
