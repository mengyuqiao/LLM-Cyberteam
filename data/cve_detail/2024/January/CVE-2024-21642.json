{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21642", "Description": "D-Tale is a visualizer for Pandas data structures. Users hosting versions D-Tale prior to 3.9.0 publicly can be vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF), allowing attackers to access files on the server. Users should upgrade to version 3.9.0, where the `Load From the Web` input is turned off by default. The only workaround for versions earlier than 3.9.0 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21642", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nMAN\u00bbD-taleVersions  before (<) 3.9.0cpe:2.3:a:man:d-tale:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-19  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/man-group/dtale/security/advisories/GHSA-7hfx-h3j3-rwq4", "ref_desc": "Server-side request forgery through Web uploads \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 man-group/dtale \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/man-group/dtale?tab=readme-ov-file#load-data--sample-datasets", "ref_desc": "GitHub - man-group/dtale: Visualizer for pandas data structuresProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/man-group/dtale/commit/954f6be1a06ff8629ead2c85c6e3f8e2196b3df2", "ref_desc": "Updated web data uploads to be turned off by default \u00b7 man-group/dtale@954f6be \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
