{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23653", "Description": "BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. In addition to running containers as build steps, BuildKit also provides APIs for running interactive containers based on built images. It was possible to use these APIs to ask BuildKit to run a container with elevated privileges. Normally, running such containers is only allowed if special `security.insecure` entitlement is enabled both by buildkitd configuration and allowed by the user initializing the build request. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5 . Avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMobyproject\u00bbBuildkitVersions  before (<) 0.12.5cpe:2.3:a:mobyproject:buildkit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit/security/advisories/GHSA-wr6v-9f75-vh2g", "ref_desc": "Interactive containers API does not validate entitlements check \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 moby/buildkit \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit/pull/4602", "ref_desc": "llbsolver: make sure interactive container API validates entitlements by tonistiigi \u00b7 Pull Request #4602 \u00b7 moby/buildkit \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.12.5", "ref_desc": "Release v0.12.5 \u00b7 moby/buildkit \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YavpczK_Jema-cEIH7cOf4wZ5Y8.html"}]}
