{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22410", "Description": "Creditcoin is a network that enables cross-blockchain credit transactions. The Windows binary of the Creditcoin node loads a suite of DLLs provided by Microsoft at startup. If a malicious user has access to overwrite the program files directory it is possible to replace these DLLs and execute arbitrary code. It is the view of the blockchain development team that the threat posed by a hypothetical binary planting attack is minimal and represents a low-security risk. The vulnerable DLL files are from the Windows networking subsystem, the Visual C++ runtime, and low-level cryptographic primitives. Collectively these dependencies are required for a large ecosystem of applications, ranging from enterprise-level security applications to game engines, and don\u2019t represent a fundamental lack of security or oversight in the design and implementation of Creditcoin. The blockchain team takes the stance that running Creditcoin on Windows is officially unsupported and at best should be thought of as experimental.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22410", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGluwa\u00bbCreditcoincpe:2.3:a:gluwa:creditcoin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Binary_planting", "ref_desc": "Binary Planting | OWASP FoundationNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gluwa/creditcoin/security/advisories/GHSA-cx5c-xwcv-vhmq", "ref_desc": "Binary Planting Attack on Windows Platforms \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gluwa/creditcoin \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
