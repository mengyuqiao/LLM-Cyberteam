{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22407", "Description": "Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. In the Shopware CMS, the state handler for orders fails to sufficiently verify user authorizations for actions that modify the payment, delivery, and/or order status. Due to this inadequate implementation, users lacking 'write' permissions for orders are still able to change the order state. This issue has been addressed and users are advised to update to Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22407", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  before (<) 6.5.7.4cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-25  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-3867-jc5c-66qf", "ref_desc": "Broken Access Control order API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/shopware \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
