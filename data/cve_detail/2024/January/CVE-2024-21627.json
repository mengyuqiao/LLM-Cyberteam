{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21627", "Description": "PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. Prior to versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11, some event attributes are not detected by the `isCleanHTML` method. Some modules using the `isCleanHTML` method could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11 contain a patch for this issue. The best workaround is to use the `HTMLPurifier` library to sanitize html input coming from users. The library is already available as a dependency in the PrestaShop project. Beware though that in legacy object models, fields of `HTML` type will call `isCleanHTML`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21627", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nPrestashop\u00bbPrestashopVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.1.3cpe:2.3:a:prestashop:prestashop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPrestashop\u00bbPrestashopVersions  before (<) 1.7.8.11cpe:2.3:a:prestashop:prestashop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/ba06d18466df5b92cb841d504cc7210121104883", "ref_desc": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'security/advisory-fix-2' into build-1-1\u2026 \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop@ba06d18 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/73cfb44666818eefd501b526a894fe884dd12129", "ref_desc": "Merge remote-tracking branch '46rq/advisory-fix-1' into 8.1.x \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop@73cfb44 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-xgpm-q3mq-46rq", "ref_desc": "Some attribute not escaped in Validate::isCleanHTML method \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
