{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-0251", "Description": "The Advanced Woo Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the search parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.96 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This only affects sites when the Dynamic Content for Elementor plugin is also installed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0251", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nAdvanced-woo-search\u00bbAdvanced Woo Search\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.96cpe:2.3:a:advanced-woo-search:advanced_woo_search:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-20  0.05%  0.36%  +0.32 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/advanced-woo-search/tags/2.97/includes/class-aws-integrations.php#L2104", "ref_desc": "class-aws-integrations.php in advanced-woo-search/tags/2.97/includes \u2013 WordPress Plugin RepositoryIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/advanced-woo-search/tags/2.94/includes/class-aws-integrations.php#L287", "ref_desc": "class-aws-integrations.php in advanced-woo-search/tags/2.94/includes \u2013 WordPress Plugin RepositoryIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/advanced-woo-search/tags/2.94/includes/class-aws-integrations.php#L2170", "ref_desc": "429 Too Many RequestsIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/91358e40-e64f-4e8e-b5a3-7d2133db5fe9?source=cve", "ref_desc": "Advanced Woo Search <= 2.96 - Reflected Cross-Site ScriptingThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
