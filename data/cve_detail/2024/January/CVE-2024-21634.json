{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21634", "Description": "Amazon Ion is a Java implementation of the Ion data notation. Prior to version 1.10.5, a potential denial-of-service issue exists in\u00a0`ion-java`\u00a0for applications that use\u00a0`ion-java`\u00a0to deserialize Ion text encoded data, or deserialize Ion text or binary encoded data into the\u00a0`IonValue`\u00a0model and then invoke certain\u00a0`IonValue`\u00a0methods on that in-memory representation. An actor could craft Ion data that, when loaded by the affected application and/or processed using the\u00a0`IonValue`\u00a0model, results in a\u00a0`StackOverflowError`\u00a0originating from the\u00a0`ion-java`\u00a0library. The patch is included in `ion-java` 1.10.5. As a workaround, do not load data which originated from an untrusted source or that could have been tampered with.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21634", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbIONVersions  before (<) 1.10.5cpe:2.3:a:amazon:ion:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-java/security/advisories/GHSA-264p-99wq-f4j6", "ref_desc": "Ion Java StackOverflow vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 amazon-ion/ion-java \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
