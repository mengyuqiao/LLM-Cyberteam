{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24579", "Description": "stereoscope is a go library for processing container images and simulating a squash filesystem.  Prior to version 0.0.1, it is possible to craft an OCI tar archive that, when stereoscope attempts to unarchive the contents, will result in writing to paths outside of the unarchive temporary directory. Specifically, use of `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/file.UntarToDirectory()` function, the  `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image/oci.TarballImageProvider` struct, or the higher level `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image.Image.Read()` function express this vulnerability. As a workaround, if you are using the OCI archive as input into stereoscope then you can switch to using an OCI layout by unarchiving the tar archive and provide the unarchived directory to stereoscope.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24579", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nAnchore\u00bbStereoscope\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 0.0.1cpe:2.3:a:anchore:stereoscope:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-10  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anchore/stereoscope/commit/09dacab4d9ee65ee8bc7af8ebf4aa7b5aaa36204", "ref_desc": "fix tar path traversal issue (#214) \u00b7 anchore/stereoscope@09dacab \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anchore/stereoscope/security/advisories/GHSA-hpxr-w9w7-g4gv", "ref_desc": "Tar path traversal in stereoscope when processing OCI tar archives \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anchore/stereoscope \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
