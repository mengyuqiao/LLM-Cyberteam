{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23648", "Description": "Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a backend user interface for Pimcore. The password reset functionality sends to the the user requesting a password change an email containing an URL to reset its password. The URL sent contains a unique token, valid during 24 hours, allowing the user to reset its password. This token is highly sensitive ; as an attacker able to retrieve it would be able to resets the user's password. Prior to version 1.2.3, the reset-password URL is crafted using the \"Host\" HTTP header of the request sent to request a password reset. This way, an external attacker could send password requests for users, but specify a \"Host\" header of a website that they control. If the user receiving the mail clicks on the link, the attacker would retrieve the reset token of the victim and perform account takeover. Version 1.2.3 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23648", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPimcore\u00bbAdmin Classic Bundle\u00bbForPimcoreVersions  before (<) 1.2.3cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:admin_classic_bundle:*:*:*:*:*:pimcore:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-03  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/70f2205b5a5ea9584721d4f3e803f4d0dd5e4655", "ref_desc": "Password reset - fix for possible host header injection (#362) \u00b7 pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle@70f2205 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/security/advisories/GHSA-mrqg-mwh7-q94j", "ref_desc": "Host header injection in the password reset \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
