{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22403", "Description": "Nextcloud server is a self hosted personal cloud system. In affected versions OAuth codes did not expire. When an attacker would get access to an authorization code they could authenticate at any time using the code. As of version 28.0.0 OAuth codes are invalidated after 10 minutes and will no longer be authenticated. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to intercept an OAuth code from a user session. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22403", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 28.0.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S6PN4GVJ5TZUC6WSG4X3ZA3AMPBEKNAX/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: nextcloud-28.0.4-2.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-wppc-f5g8-vx36", "ref_desc": "OAuth2 authorization codes are valid indefinetly \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1784162", "ref_desc": "Sign in | HackerOnePermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/40766", "ref_desc": "Make OAuth2 authorization code expire by julien-nc \u00b7 Pull Request #40766 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
