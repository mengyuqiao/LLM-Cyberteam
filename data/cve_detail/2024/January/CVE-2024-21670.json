{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21670", "Description": "Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. The revocation schema that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, allowing a malicious holder of a revoked credential to generate a valid Non-Revocation Proof for that credential as part of an AnonCreds presentation. A verifier may verify a credential from a holder as being \"not revoked\" when in fact, the holder's credential has been revoked. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21670", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHyperledger\u00bbUrsa\u00bbVersion:0.1.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:hyperledger:ursa:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-25  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa/security/advisories/GHSA-r78f-4q2q-hvv4", "ref_desc": "Ursa CL-Signatures Revocation allows holders to demonstrate non-revocation of a revoked credential \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hyperledger-archives/ursa \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
