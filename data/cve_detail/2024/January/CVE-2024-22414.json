{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22414", "Description": "flaskBlog is a simple blog app built with Flask. Improper storage and rendering of the `/user/<user>` page allows a user's comments to execute arbitrary javascript code. The html template `user.html` contains the following code snippet to render comments made by a user: `<div class=\"content\" tag=\"content\">{{comment[2]|safe}}</div>`. Use of the \"safe\" tag causes flask to _not_ escape the rendered content. To remediate this, simply remove the `|safe` tag from the HTML above. No fix is is available and users are advised to manually edit their installation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22414", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDogukanurker\u00bbFlaskblogVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:dogukanurker:flaskblog:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DogukanUrker/flaskBlog/security/advisories/GHSA-mrcw-j96f-p6v6", "ref_desc": "User profile page vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DogukanUrker/flaskBlog \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
