{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21638", "Description": "Azure IPAM (IP Address Management) is a lightweight solution developed on top of the Azure platform designed to help Azure customers manage their IP Address space easily and effectively. By design there is no write access to customers' Azure environments as the Service Principal used is only assigned the Reader role at the root Management Group level. Until recently, the solution lacked the validation of the passed in authentication token which may result in attacker impersonating any privileged user to access data stored within the IPAM instance and subsequently from Azure, causing an elevation of privilege. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21638", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbAzure IpamVersions  before (<) 3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:azure_ipam:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.27%  0.19%  -0.08 \n 2  2024-11-16  0.14%  0.27%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-11-05  0.18%  0.14%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-10-13  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-08-18  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 6  2024-08-05  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 7  2024-06-14  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 8  2024-04-18  0.13%  0.12%  -0.02 \n 9  2024-02-12  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 10  2024-01-20  0.05%  0.12%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Azure/ipam/pull/218", "ref_desc": "Token Validation + Fixes by DCMattyG \u00b7 Pull Request #218 \u00b7 Azure/ipam \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Azure/ipam/commit/64ef2d07edf16ffa50f29c7e0e25d32d974b367f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #218 from Azure/vnet-missing-fix \u00b7 Azure/ipam@64ef2d0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Azure/ipam/security/advisories/GHSA-m8mp-jq4c-g8j6", "ref_desc": "Open-source Azure IPAM solution Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Azure/ipam \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
