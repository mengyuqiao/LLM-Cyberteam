{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21653", "Description": "The vantage6 technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC).  Nodes and servers get a ssh config by default that permits root login with password authentication. In a proper deployment, the SSH service is not exposed so there is no risk, but not all deployments are ideal. The default should therefore be less permissive.  The vulnerability can be mitigated by removing the ssh part from the docker file and rebuilding the docker image.  Version 4.2.0 patches the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21653", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nVantage6\u00bbVantage6Versions  before (<) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:vantage6:vantage6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/commit/3fcc6e6a8bd1142fd7a558d8fdd2b246e55c8841", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2wgc-48g2-cj5w \u00b7 vantage6/vantage6@3fcc6e6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-2wgc-48g2-cj5w", "ref_desc": "Insecure SSH configuration for node and server containers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vantage6/vantage6 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
