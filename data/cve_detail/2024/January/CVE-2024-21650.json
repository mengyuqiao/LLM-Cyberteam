{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21650", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. XWiki is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack through its user registration feature. This issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious payloads in the \"first name\" or \"last name\" fields during user registration. This impacts all installations that have user registration enabled for guests. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.17, 15.5.3 and 15.8 RC1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21650", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 15.6andup to, including, (<=) 15.7cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  before (<) 14.10.17cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andbefore (<) 15.5.3cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "85.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-27  88.99%  85.42%  -3.57 \n 2  2024-11-14  94.09%  88.99%  -5.10 \n 3  2024-11-03  94.41%  94.09%  -0.32 \n 4  2024-10-11  87.06%  94.41%  +7.35 \n 5  2024-09-28  86.62%  87.06%  +0.44 \n 6  2024-09-06  80.97%  86.62%  +5.65 \n 7  2024-08-26  80.39%  80.97%  +0.59 \n 8  2024-08-03  79.27%  80.39%  +1.12 \n 9  2024-07-23  77.99%  79.27%  +1.27 \n 10  2024-07-15  82.05%  77.99%  -4.06 \n 11  2024-06-30  73.83%  82.05%  +8.22 \n 12  2024-06-22  0.59%  73.83%  +73.24 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-95 Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/95/Improper-Neutralization-of-Directives-in-Dynamically-Evaluat.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-rj7p-xjv7-7229", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability via User Registration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21173", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-21173] RCE via first name in user registration - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/b290bfd573c6f7db6cc15a88dd4111d9fcad0d31", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21173: Improve escaping in registration success message \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@b290bfd \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
