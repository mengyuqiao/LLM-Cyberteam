{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23652", "Description": "BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. A malicious BuildKit frontend or Dockerfile using RUN --mount could trick the feature that removes empty files created for the mountpoints into removing a file outside the container, from the host system. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5. Workarounds include avoiding using BuildKit frontends from an untrusted source or building an untrusted Dockerfile containing RUN --mount feature.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nMobyproject\u00bbBuildkitVersions  before (<) 0.12.5cpe:2.3:a:mobyproject:buildkit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit/security/advisories/GHSA-4v98-7qmw-rqr8", "ref_desc": "Possible host system access from mount stub cleaner \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 moby/buildkit \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.12.5", "ref_desc": "Release v0.12.5 \u00b7 moby/buildkit \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YavpczK_Jema-cEIH7cOf4wZ5Y8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit/pull/4603", "ref_desc": "executor: recheck mount stub path within root after container run by tonistiigi \u00b7 Pull Request #4603 \u00b7 moby/buildkit \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
