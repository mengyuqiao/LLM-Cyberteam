{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21629", "Description": "Rust EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine interpreter. In `rust-evm`, a feature called `record_external_operation` was introduced, allowing library users to record custom gas changes. This feature can have some bogus interactions with the call stack. In particular, during finalization of a `CREATE` or `CREATE2`, in the case that the substack execution happens successfully, `rust-evm` will first commit the substate, and then call `record_external_operation(Write(out_code.len()))`. If `record_external_operation` later fails, this error is returned to the parent call stack, instead of `Succeeded`. Yet, the substate commitment already happened. This causes smart contracts able to commit state changes, when the parent caller contract receives zero address (which usually indicates that the execution has failed). This issue only impacts library users with custom `record_external_operation` that returns errors. The issue is patched in release 0.41.1. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21629", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEvm Project\u00bbEVM\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.41.1cpe:2.3:a:evm_project:evm:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/703/Improper-Check-or-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm/commit/d8991ec727ad0fb64fe9957a3cd307387a6701e4", "ref_desc": "Fix cleanup_create order and release v0.41.1 (#264) \u00b7 rust-ethereum/evm@d8991ec \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm/pull/264", "ref_desc": "Fix cleanup_create order and release v0.41.1 by sorpaas \u00b7 Pull Request #264 \u00b7 rust-ethereum/evm \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm/security/advisories/GHSA-27wg-99g8-2v4v", "ref_desc": "Erroneous handling of `record_external_operation` error return \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-ethereum/evm \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm/blob/release-v041/src/executor/stack/executor.rs#L1012C25-L1012C69", "ref_desc": "evm/src/executor/stack/executor.rs at release-v041 \u00b7 rust-ethereum/evm \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
