Users of JupyterLab who click on a malicious link may get their `Authorization` and `XSRFToken` tokens exposed to a third party when running an older `jupyter-server` version. JupyterLab versions 4.1.0b2, 4.0.11, and 3.6.7 are patched. No workaround has been identified, however users should ensure to upgrade `jupyter-server` to version 2.7.2 or newer which includes a redirect vulnerability fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22421", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:39cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:39:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJupyter\u00bbNotebookVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.7cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:notebook:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJupyter\u00bbJupyterlabVersions  before (<) 3.6.7cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyterlab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJupyter\u00bbJupyterlabVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.0.11cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyterlab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-09  0.09%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-01-27  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/commit/19bd9b96cb2e77170a67e43121637d0b5619e8c6", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-44cc-43rp-5947 \u00b7 jupyterlab/jupyterlab@19bd9b9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UQJKNRDRFMKGVRIYNNN6CKMNJDNYWO2H/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: python-notebook-7.0.7-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/X4azgDJMMH2k31SDmLChe-7JFVo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/security/advisories/GHSA-44cc-43rp-5947", "ref_desc": "Potential authentication and CSRF tokens leak in JupyterLab \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterlab/jupyterlab \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
