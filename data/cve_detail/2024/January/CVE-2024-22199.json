{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22199", "Description": "This package provides universal methods to use multiple template engines with the Fiber web framework using the Views interface. This vulnerability specifically impacts web applications that render user-supplied data through this template engine, potentially leading to the execution of malicious scripts in users' browsers when visiting affected web pages. The vulnerability has been addressed, the template engine now defaults to having autoescape set to `true`, effectively mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22199", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGofiber\u00bbDjango\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 3.1.9cpe:2.3:a:gofiber:django:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-14  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-09-09  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2024-01-19  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/template/security/advisories/GHSA-4mq2-gc4j-cmw6", "ref_desc": "Django Template Engine Vulnerable to XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gofiber/template \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/template/commit/28cff3ac4d4c117ab25b5396954676d624b6cb46", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #326 from gofiber/django-autoescape \u00b7 gofiber/template@28cff3a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
