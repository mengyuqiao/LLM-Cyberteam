{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23329", "Description": "changedetection.io is an open source tool designed to monitor websites for content changes. In affected versions the API endpoint `/api/v1/watch/<uuid>/history` can be accessed by any unauthorized user. As a result any unauthorized user can check one's watch history. However, because unauthorized party first needs to know a watch UUID, and the watch history endpoint itself returns only paths to the snapshot on the server, an impact on users' data privacy is minimal. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.13. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23329", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nChangedetection\u00bbChangedetectionVersions  from including (>=) 0.39.14andbefore (<) 0.45.13cpe:2.3:a:changedetection:changedetection:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-hcvp-2cc7-jrwr", "ref_desc": "API endpoint `/api/v1/watch/<uuid>/history` is not secured with API token \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dgtlmoon/changedetection.io \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/commit/402f1e47e78ecd155b1e90f30cce424ff7763e0f", "ref_desc": "Security update - Adding API token secure check for API endpoint `/ap\u2026 \u00b7 dgtlmoon/changedetection.io@402f1e4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
