{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21641", "Description": "Flarum is open source discussion platform software. Prior to version 1.8.5, the Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation to redirect to any link. For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected. This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation. The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. As a workaround, some extensions modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21641", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nFlarum\u00bbFlarumVersions  before (<) 1.8.5cpe:2.3:a:flarum:flarum:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-19  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/7d70328471cf3091d92d95c382d277aec7996176", "ref_desc": "[1.x] fix: Logout controller allows open redirects (#3948) \u00b7 flarum/framework@7d70328 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-733r-8xcp-w9mr", "ref_desc": "Logout Route allows open redirects \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flarum/framework \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flarum/flarum-core/commit/ee8b3b4ad1413a2b0971fdd9e40f812d2a3a9d3a", "ref_desc": "[1.x] fix: Logout controller allows open redirects (#3948) \u00b7 flarum/flarum-core@ee8b3b4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
