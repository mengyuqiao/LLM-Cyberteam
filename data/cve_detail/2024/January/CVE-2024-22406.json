{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22406", "Description": "Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. The Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the \u201caggregations\u201d object. The \u2018name\u2019 field in this \u201caggregations\u201d object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using time-based SQL-queries.  This issue has been addressed and users are advised to update to Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22406", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  before (<) 6.5.7.4cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-25  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-qmp9-2xwj-m6m9", "ref_desc": "Blind SQL-injection in DAL aggregations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/shopware \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
