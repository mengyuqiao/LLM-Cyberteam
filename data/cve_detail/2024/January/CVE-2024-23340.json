{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23340", "Description": "@hono/node-server is an adapter that allows users to run Hono applications on Node.js. Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called \"double dots\", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use `serveStatic`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23340", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nHono\u00bbNode-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0andbefore (<) 1.4.1cpe:2.3:a:hono:node-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-31  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-rjq5-w47x-x359", "ref_desc": "Can't handle \"double dots\" in URL \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 honojs/node-server \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/honojs/node-server/commit/dd9b9a9b23e3896403c90a740e7f1f0892feb402", "ref_desc": "fix(request): handle \"double dots\" in URL (#124) \u00b7 honojs/node-server@dd9b9a9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/honojs/node-server/blob/8cea466fd05e6d2e99c28011fc0e2c2d3f3397c9/src/request.ts#L43-L45", "ref_desc": "node-server/src/request.ts at 8cea466fd05e6d2e99c28011fc0e2c2d3f3397c9 \u00b7 honojs/node-server \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
