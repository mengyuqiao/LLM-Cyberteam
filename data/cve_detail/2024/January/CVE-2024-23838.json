{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23838", "Description": "TrueLayer.NET is the .Net client for TrueLayer.  The vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious actor to gain control over the destination URL of the HttpClient used in the API classes. For applications using the SDK, requests to unexpected resources on local networks or to the internet could be made which could lead to information disclosure. The issue can be mitigated by having strict egress rules limiting the destinations to which requests can be made, and applying strict validation to any user input passed to the `truelayer-dotnet` library. Versions of TrueLayer.Client `v1.6.0` and later are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23838", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTruelayer\u00bbTruelayer.netVersions  before (<) 1.6.0cpe:2.3:a:truelayer:truelayer.net:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TrueLayer/truelayer-dotnet/security/advisories/GHSA-67m4-qxp3-j6hh", "ref_desc": "SSRF when fetching payment or payment provider \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TrueLayer/truelayer-dotnet \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TrueLayer/truelayer-dotnet/commit/75e436ed5360faa73d6e7ce3a9903a3c49505e3e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-67m4-qxp3-j6hh \u00b7 TrueLayer/truelayer-dotnet@75e436e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
