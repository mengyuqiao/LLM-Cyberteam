{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-20287", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco WAP371 Wireless-AC/N Dual Radio Access Point (AP) with Single Point Setup could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection attacks against an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-20287", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWap371 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:cisco:wap371_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbWap371\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-31  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-wap-inject-bHStWgXO", "ref_desc": "Cisco WAP371 Wireless Access Point Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
