{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23170", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 2.x before 2.28.7 and 3.x before 3.5.2. There was a timing side channel in RSA private operations. This side channel could be sufficient for a local attacker to recover the plaintext. It requires the attacker to send a large number of messages for decryption, as described in \"Everlasting ROBOT: the Marvin Attack\" by Hubert Kario.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23170", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nARM\u00bbMbed TlsVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.5.2cpe:2.3:a:arm:mbed_tls:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nARM\u00bbMbed TlsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.28.7cpe:2.3:a:arm:mbed_tls:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GP5UU7Z6LJNBLBT4SC5WWS2HDNMTFZH5/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: mbedtls-2.28.7-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5ehnodxLK0r4ecpGM1HyexZ7td0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2024-01-1/", "ref_desc": "Timing side channel in private key RSA operations. \u2014 Mbed TLS documentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IIBPEYSVRK4IFLBSYJAWKH33YBNH5HR2/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: mbedtls-2.28.7-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZtI0bWV6nmZGTxbZlqwXnUz-G84.html"}]}
