{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23726", "Description": "Ubee DDW365 XCNDDW365 devices have predictable default WPA2 PSKs that could lead to unauthorized remote access. A remote attacker (in proximity to a Wi-Fi network) can derive the default WPA2-PSK value by observing a beacon frame. A PSK is generated by using the first six characters of the SSID and the last six of the BSSID, decrementing the last digit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23726", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nUbeeinteractive\u00bbDdw365 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:ubeeinteractive:ddw365_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Ubeeinteractive\u00bbDdw365\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-30  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/Ubee/CWE-1392.md", "ref_desc": "cve/Ubee/CWE-1392.md at main \u00b7 actuator/cve \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
