{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21625", "Description": "SideQuest is a place to get virtual reality applications for Oculus Quest. The SideQuest desktop application uses deep links with a custom protocol (`sidequest://`) to trigger actions in the application from its web contents. Because, prior to version 0.10.35, the deep link URLs were not sanitized properly in all cases, a one-click remote code execution can be achieved in cases when a device is connected, the user is presented with a malicious link and clicks it from within the application. As of version 0.10.35, the custom protocol links within the electron application are now being parsed and sanitized properly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21625", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSidequestvr\u00bbSidequestVersions  before (<) 0.10.35cpe:2.3:a:sidequestvr:sidequest:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-13  0.18%  0.16%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-02-05  0.23%  0.18%  -0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/SideQuestVR/SideQuest/security/advisories/GHSA-3v86-cf9q-x4x7", "ref_desc": "One-click remote code execution via malicious deep link \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 SideQuestVR/SideQuest \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
