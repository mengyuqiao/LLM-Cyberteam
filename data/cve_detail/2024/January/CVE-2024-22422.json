{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22422", "Description": "AnythingLLM is an application that turns any document, resource, or piece of content into context that any LLM can use as references during chatting. In versions prior to commit `08d33cfd8` an unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attacker to crash the server resulting in a denial of service attack. The \u201cdata-export\u201d endpoint is used to export files using the filename parameter as user input. The endpoint takes the user input, filters it to avoid directory traversal attacks, fetches the file from the server, and afterwards deletes it. An attacker can trick the input filter mechanism to point to the current directory, and while attempting to delete it the server will crash as there is no error-handling wrapper around it. Moreover, the endpoint is public and does not require any form of authentication, resulting in an unauthenticated Denial of Service issue, which crashes the instance using a single HTTP packet. This issue has been addressed in commit `08d33cfd8`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22422", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMintplexlabs\u00bbAnythingllmVersions  before (<) 2024-01-18cpe:2.3:a:mintplexlabs:anythingllm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/commit/08d33cfd8fc47c5052b6ea29597c964a9da641e2", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xmj6-g32r-fc5q \u00b7 Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm@08d33cf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/security/advisories/GHSA-xmj6-g32r-fc5q", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated Denial of Service (DOS) attack in File Exports \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
