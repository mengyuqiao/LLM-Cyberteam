{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24565", "Description": "CrateDB is a distributed SQL database that makes it simple to store and analyze massive amounts of data in real-time. There is a COPY FROM function in the CrateDB database that is used to import file data into database tables. This function has a flaw, and authenticated attackers can use the COPY FROM function to import arbitrary file content into database tables, resulting in information leakage. This vulnerability is patched in 5.3.9, 5.4.8, 5.5.4, and 5.6.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24565", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCratedb\u00bbCratedbVersions  from including (>=) 5.4.0andbefore (<) 5.4.8cpe:2.3:a:cratedb:cratedb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCratedb\u00bbCratedbVersions  from including (>=) 5.6.0andbefore (<) 5.6.1cpe:2.3:a:cratedb:cratedb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCratedb\u00bbCratedbVersions  from including (>=) 5.5.0andbefore (<) 5.5.4cpe:2.3:a:cratedb:cratedb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCratedb\u00bbCratedbVersions  before (<) 5.3.9cpe:2.3:a:cratedb:cratedb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "13.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  21.68%  13.55%  -8.14 \n 2  2024-11-13  19.66%  21.68%  +2.02 \n 3  2024-11-02  14.90%  19.66%  +4.76 \n 4  2024-10-20  11.50%  14.90%  +3.40 \n 5  2024-09-28  10.32%  11.50%  +1.18 \n 6  2024-09-17  9.16%  10.32%  +1.15 \n 7  2024-09-07  7.16%  9.16%  +2.01 \n 8  2024-08-14  5.24%  7.16%  +1.92 \n 9  2024-08-06  4.26%  5.24%  +0.98 \n 10  2024-07-04  5.16%  4.26%  -0.90 \n 11  2024-06-19  0.05%  5.16%  +5.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/crate/crate/commit/4e857d675683095945dd524d6ba03e692c70ecd6", "ref_desc": "Restrict `COPY FROM` using local files to superuser \u00b7 crate/crate@4e857d6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crate/crate/security/advisories/GHSA-475g-vj6c-xf96", "ref_desc": "CrateDB database has an arbitrary file read vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 crate/crate \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
