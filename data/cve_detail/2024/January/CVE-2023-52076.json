{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-52076", "Description": "Atril Document Viewer is the default document reader of the MATE desktop environment for Linux. A path traversal and arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in versions of Atril prior to 1.26.2. This vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files anywhere on the filesystem to which the user opening a crafted document has access. The only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to overwrite existing files, but that doesn't stop an attacker from achieving Remote Command Execution on the target system. Version 1.26.2 of Atril contains a patch for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52076", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nMate-desktop\u00bbAtrilVersions  before (<) 1.26.2cpe:2.3:a:mate-desktop:atril:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.68%  0.62%  -0.07 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.64%  0.68%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-08-10  0.52%  0.64%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-06-13  0.41%  0.52%  +0.11 \n 5  2024-02-03  0.15%  0.41%  +0.27 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-24 Path Traversal: '../filedir'", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/24/Path-Traversal-..-filedir-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-25 Path Traversal: '/../filedir'", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/25/Path-Traversal-..-filedir-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-27 Path Traversal: 'dir/../../filename'", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/27/Path-Traversal-dir-..-..-filename-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mate-desktop/atril/commit/e70b21c815418a1e6ebedf6d8d31b8477c03ba50", "ref_desc": "epub: Prevent path traversal when extracting files \u00b7 mate-desktop/atril@e70b21c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00003.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3828-1] atril security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mate-desktop/atril/security/advisories/GHSA-6mf6-mxpc-jc37", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Atril's EPUB ebook parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mate-desktop/atril \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mate-desktop/atril/releases/tag/v1.26.2", "ref_desc": "Release atril 1.26.2 release \u00b7 mate-desktop/atril \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
