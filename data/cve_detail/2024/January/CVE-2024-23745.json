{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23745", "Description": "In Notion Web Clipper 1.0.3(7), a .nib file is susceptible to the Dirty NIB attack. NIB files can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, even if a NIB file is modified within an application, Gatekeeper may still permit the execution of the application, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands within the application's context. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that this is simply an instance of CVE-2022-48505, cannot properly be categorized as a product-level vulnerability, and cannot have a product-level fix because it is about incorrect caching of file signatures on macOS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23745", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNotion\u00bbWeb Clipper\u00bbVersion:1.0.3(7)cpe:2.3:a:notion:web_clipper:1.0.3\\(7\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-07  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-04-14  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-03-14  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.xpnsec.com/dirtynib/", "ref_desc": "MacOS \"DirtyNIB\" Vulnerability - XPN InfoSec Blog", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/louiselalanne/CVE-2024-23745", "ref_desc": "GitHub - louiselalanne/CVE-2024-23745: In Notion Web Clipper 1.0.3(7), a .nib file is susceptible to the Dirty NIB attack.Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/faq.md#Why-arent-physically_local-attacks-in-Chromes-threat-model", "ref_desc": "Chromium Docs - Chrome Security FAQ", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
