{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23651", "Description": "BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. Two malicious build steps running in parallel sharing the same cache mounts with subpaths could cause a race condition that can lead to files from the host system being accessible to the build container. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5. Workarounds include, avoiding using BuildKit frontend from an untrusted source or building an untrusted Dockerfile containing cache mounts with --mount=type=cache,source=... options.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMobyproject\u00bbBuildkitVersions  before (<) 0.12.5cpe:2.3:a:mobyproject:buildkit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit/security/advisories/GHSA-m3r6-h7wv-7xxv", "ref_desc": "Possible race condition with accessing subpaths from cache mounts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 moby/buildkit \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit/pull/4604", "ref_desc": "exec: add extra validation for submount sources by tonistiigi \u00b7 Pull Request #4604 \u00b7 moby/buildkit \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.12.5", "ref_desc": "Release v0.12.5 \u00b7 moby/buildkit \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YavpczK_Jema-cEIH7cOf4wZ5Y8.html"}]}
