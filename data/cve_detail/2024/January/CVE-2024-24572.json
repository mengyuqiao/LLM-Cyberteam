{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-24572", "Description": "facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the sysadmin in mind. In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, the $_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php. The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However, it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search_sql. Knowing this, an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search_sql\nvariable by appending a GET parameter search_sql in the URL. The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24572", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nFacilemanager\u00bbFacilemanagerVersions  before (<) 4.5.1cpe:2.3:a:facilemanager:facilemanager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/security/advisories/GHSA-xw34-8pj6-75gc", "ref_desc": "Authenticated Variable Manipulation leading to SQL Injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 WillyXJ/facileManager \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/commit/0aa850d4b518f10143a4c675142b15caa5872877", "ref_desc": "fM - #599 - Multiple security fixes \u00b7 WillyXJ/facileManager@0aa850d \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pti84-IDniFFvouB0CBZLBx_BHY.html"}]}
