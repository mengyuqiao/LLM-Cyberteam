{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23825", "Description": "TablePress is a table plugin for Wordpress. For importing tables, TablePress makes external HTTP requests based on a URL that is provided by the user. That user input is filtered insufficiently, which makes it is possible to send requests to unintended network locations and receive responses. On sites in a cloud environment like AWS, an attacker can potentially make GET requests to the instance's metadata REST API. If the instance's configuration is insecure, this can lead to the exposure of internal data, including credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23825", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nTablepress\u00bbTablepress\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.2.5cpe:2.3:a:tablepress:tablepress:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TablePress/TablePress/security/advisories/GHSA-x8rf-c8x6-mrpg", "ref_desc": "SSRF vulnerability due to insufficient filtering of cloud provider hosts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TablePress/TablePress \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TablePress/TablePress/commit/62aab50e7a9c486caaeff26dff4dc01e059ecb91", "ref_desc": "Finish TablePress 2.2.5. \u00b7 TablePress/TablePress@62aab50 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
