As a result, some memory access could occur on memory regions that were previously freed. Once freed, a memory region can be reused for other allocations and any previously stored data in this memory region is considered lost.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0217", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:39cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:39:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPackagekit Project\u00bbPackagekitVersions  before (<) 1.2.7cpe:2.3:a:packagekit_project:packagekit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-31  0.04%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PackageKit/PackageKit/commit/64278c9127e3333342b56ead99556161f7e86f79", "ref_desc": "pk-transaction: Check that Finished signal is emitted at most once \u00b7 PackageKit/PackageKit@64278c9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2256624", "ref_desc": "2256624 \u2013 (CVE-2024-0217) CVE-2024-0217 PackageKitd: Use-After-Free in Idle Function CallbackIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0217", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-0217- Red Hat Customer PortalMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
