{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-1019", "Description": "ModSecurity / libModSecurity 3.0.0 to 3.0.11 is affected by a WAF bypass for path-based payloads submitted via specially crafted request URLs. ModSecurity v3 decodes percent-encoded characters present in request URLs before it separates the URL path component from the optional query string component. This results in an impedance mismatch versus RFC compliant back-end applications. The vulnerability hides an attack payload in the path component of the URL from WAF rules inspecting it. A back-end may be vulnerable if it uses the path component of request URLs to construct queries. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.0.12. The ModSecurity v2 release line is not affected by this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1019", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nTrustwave\u00bbModsecurityVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.12cpe:2.3:a:trustwave:modsecurity:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-20  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity/tab_cves#cve-2024-1019-2024-01-30", "ref_desc": "CVEs | OWASP FoundationPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K6ZGABPJK2JPVH2JDFHZ5LQLWGONUH7V/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: libmodsecurity-3.0.12-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/34KDQNZE2RS3CWFG5654LNHKXXDPIW5I/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: libmodsecurity-3.0.12-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
