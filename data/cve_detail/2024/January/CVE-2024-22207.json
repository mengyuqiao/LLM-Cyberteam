{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22207", "Description": "fastify-swagger-ui is a Fastify plugin for serving Swagger UI.  Prior to 2.1.0, the default configuration of `@fastify/swagger-ui` without `baseDir` set will lead to all files in the module's directory being exposed via http routes served by the module.  The vulnerability is fixed in v2.1.0. Setting the `baseDir` option can also work around this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22207", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSmartbear\u00bbSwagger Ui\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:smartbear:swagger_ui:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "5.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  7.03%  5.09%  -1.94 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.05%  7.03%  +6.98 \n 3  2024-02-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1188/Initialization-of-a-Resource-with-an-Insecure-Default.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-22207 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-swagger-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-62jr-84gf-wmg4", "ref_desc": "Default swagger-ui configuration exposes all files in the module \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fastify/fastify-swagger-ui \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-swagger-ui/commit/13d799a2c5f14d3dd5b15892e03bbcbae63ee6f7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-62jr-84gf-wmg4 \u00b7 fastify/fastify-swagger-ui@13d799a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
