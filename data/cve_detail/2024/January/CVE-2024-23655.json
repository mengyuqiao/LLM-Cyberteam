{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23655", "Description": "Tuta is an encrypted email service. Starting in version 3.118.12 and prior to version 3.119.10, an attacker is able to send a manipulated email so that the user can no longer use the app to get access to received emails. By sending a manipulated email, an attacker could put the app into an unusable state. In this case, a user can no longer access received e-mails. Since the vulnerability affects not only the app, but also the web application, a user in this case has no way to access received emails. This issue was tested with iOS and the web app, but it is possible all clients are affected. Version 3.119.10 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23655", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nTuta\u00bbTutanotaVersions  from including (>=) 3.118.12andbefore (<) 3.119.10cpe:2.3:a:tuta:tutanota:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/security/advisories/GHSA-5h47-g927-629g", "ref_desc": "Attacker can prevent users from accessing received emails \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tutao/tutanota \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/releases/tag/tutanota-release-3.119.10", "ref_desc": "Release 3.119.10 \u00b7 tutao/tutanota \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
