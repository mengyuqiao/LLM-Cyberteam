{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-23820", "Description": "OpenFGA, an authorization/permission engine, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack in versions prior to 1.4.3. In some scenarios that depend on the model and tuples used, a call to `ListObjects` may not  release memory properly. So when a sufficiently high number of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server can create an `out of memory` error and terminate. Version 1.4.3 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23820", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpenfga\u00bbOpenfgaVersions  before (<) 1.4.3cpe:2.3:a:openfga:openfga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-02  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-rxpw-85vw-fx87", "ref_desc": "OpenFGA DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openfga/openfga \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/908ac85c8b7769c8042cca31886df8db01976c39", "ref_desc": "fix: handle ReverseExpand channel closure correctly (#1315) \u00b7 openfga/openfga@908ac85 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.4.3", "ref_desc": "Release v1.4.3 \u00b7 openfga/openfga \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
