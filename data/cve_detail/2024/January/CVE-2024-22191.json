{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-22191", "Description": "Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in the key_value field of Avo v3.2.3 and v2.46.0. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. The value of the key_value is inserted directly into the HTML code. In the current version of Avo (possibly also older versions), the value is not properly sanitized before it is inserted into the HTML code. This vulnerability could be used to steal sensitive information from victims that could be used to hijack victims' accounts or redirect them to malicious websites. Avo 3.2.4 and 2.47.0 include a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22191", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nAvohq\u00bbAVO\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.3.0cpe:2.3:a:avohq:avo:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nAvohq\u00bbAVO\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 2.47.0cpe:2.3:a:avohq:avo:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/commit/fc92a05a8556b1787c8694643286a1afa6a71258", "ref_desc": "security: v2 CVE-2024-22191 (#2382) \u00b7 avo-hq/avo@fc92a05 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hXuvX3r7u1batztPTbj20b5Jvbc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/commit/51bb80b181cd8e31744bdc4e7f9b501c81172347", "ref_desc": "security: sanitize key_value field content (#2357) \u00b7 avo-hq/avo@51bb80b \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tAsOqexMl4AtTB2f2mTA9-9wIKE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/security/advisories/GHSA-ghjv-mh6x-7q6h", "ref_desc": "stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in key_value field \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 avo-hq/avo \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
