{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-21632", "Description": "omniauth-microsoft_graph provides an Omniauth strategy for the Microsoft Graph API. Prior to versions 2.0.0, the implementation did not validate the legitimacy of the `email` attribute of the user nor did it give/document an option to do so, making it susceptible to nOAuth misconfiguration in cases when the `email` is used as a trusted user identifier. This could lead to account takeover. Version 2.0.0 contains a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21632", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRecognizeapp\u00bbOmniauth::microsoftgraph\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:recognizeapp:omniauth\\:\\:microsoftgraph:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth", "ref_desc": "nOAuth: How Microsoft OAuth Misconfiguration Can Lead to Full Account TakeoverExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph/security/advisories/GHSA-5g66-628f-7cvj", "ref_desc": "Account takeover (nOAuth) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph/commit/f132078389612b797c872b45bd0e0b47382414c1", "ref_desc": "Add email domain verification \u00b7 synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph@f132078 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
