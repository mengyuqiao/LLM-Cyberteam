{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27301", "Description": "Support App is an opensource application specialized in managing Apple devices. It's possible to abuse a vulnerability inside the postinstall installer script to make the installer execute arbitrary code as root. The cause of the vulnerability is the fact that the shebang `#!/bin/zsh` is being used. When the installer is executed it asks for the users password to be executed as root. However, it'll still be using the $HOME of the user and therefore loading the file  `$HOME/.zshenv` when the `postinstall` script is executed.\nAn attacker could add malicious code to `$HOME/.zshenv` and it will be executed when the app is installed. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to escalate privilege on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 2.5.1 Rev 2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27301", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/root3nl/SupportApp/commit/e866b2aa4028f6a982977f462c0f7550d952c5d0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jr78-247f-rhqc \u00b7 root3nl/SupportApp@e866b2a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/root3nl/SupportApp/security/advisories/GHSA-jr78-247f-rhqc", "ref_desc": "Privilege Escalation Abusing installer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 root3nl/SupportApp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
