{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28121", "Description": "stimulus_reflex is a system to extend the capabilities of both Rails and Stimulus by intercepting user interactions and passing them to Rails over real-time websockets. In affected versions more methods than expected can be called on reflex instances. Being able to call some of them has security implications. To invoke a reflex a websocket message of the following shape is sent: `\\\"target\\\":\\\"[class_name]#[method_name]\\\",\\\"args\\\":[]`. The server will proceed to instantiate `reflex` using the provided `class_name` as long as it extends `StimulusReflex::Reflex`. It then attempts to call `method_name` on the instance with the provided arguments. This is problematic as `reflex.method method_name` can be more methods that those explicitly specified by the developer in their reflex class. A good example is the instance_variable_set method. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 3.4.2 and 3.5.0.rc4. Users unable to upgrade should: see the backing GHSA advisory for mitigation advice.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28121", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-470 Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/470/Use-of-Externally-Controlled-Input-to-Select-Classes-or-Code.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/blob/0211cad7d60fe96838587f159d657e44cee51b9b/app/channels/stimulus_reflex/channel.rb#L83", "ref_desc": "stimulus_reflex/app/channels/stimulus_reflex/channel.rb at 0211cad7d60fe96838587f159d657e44cee51b9b \u00b7 stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/security/advisories/GHSA-f78j-4w3g-4q65", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary method call on reflexes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/releases/tag/v3.4.2", "ref_desc": "Release v3.4.2 \u00b7 stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Mar/16", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: StimulusReflex CVE-2024-28121", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/releases/tag/v3.5.0.rc4", "ref_desc": "Release v3.5.0.rc4 \u00b7 stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/commit/538582d240439aab76066c72335ea92096cd0c7f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-f78j-4w3g-4q65 \u00b7 stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex@538582d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
