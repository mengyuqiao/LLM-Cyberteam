{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28244", "Description": "KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\\def` or `\\newcommand` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. KaTeX supports an option named maxExpand which aims to prevent infinitely recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. Unfortunately, support for \"Unicode (sub|super)script characters\" allows an attacker to bypass this limit. Each sub/superscript group instantiated a separate Parser with its own limit on macro executions, without inheriting the current count of macro executions from its parent. This has been corrected in KaTeX v0.16.10.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28244", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/commit/085e21b5da05414efefa932570e7201a7c70e5b2", "ref_desc": "fix: maxExpand limit with Unicode sub/superscripts \u00b7 KaTeX/KaTeX@085e21b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/security/advisories/GHSA-cvr6-37gx-v8wc", "ref_desc": "maxExpand bypassed by Unicode sub/superscripts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 KaTeX/KaTeX \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
