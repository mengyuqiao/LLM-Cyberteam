{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28238", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When reaching the /files page, a JWT is passed via GET request. Inclusion of session tokens in URLs poses a security risk as URLs are often logged in various places (e.g., web server logs, browser history). Attackers gaining access to these logs may hijack active user sessions, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or actions on behalf of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28238", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-598 Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/598/Use-of-GET-Request-Method-With-Sensitive-Query-Strings.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-2ccr-g2rv-h677", "ref_desc": "Session Token in URL \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
