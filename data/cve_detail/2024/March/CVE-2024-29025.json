{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29025", "Description": "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. The `HttpPostRequestDecoder` can be tricked to accumulate data. While the decoder can store items on the disk if configured so, there are no limits to the number of fields the form can have, an attacher can send a chunked post consisting of many small fields that will be accumulated in the `bodyListHttpData` list. The decoder cumulates bytes in the `undecodedChunk` buffer until it can decode a field, this field can cumulate data without limits. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.108.Final.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29025", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/vietj/f558b8ea81ec6505f1e9a6ca283c9ae3", "ref_desc": "Reproducer.java \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-5jpm-x58v-624v", "ref_desc": "HttpPostRequestDecoder can OOM \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 netty/netty \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00015.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3834-1] netty security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/0d0c6ed782d13d423586ad0c71737b2c7d02058c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5jpm-x58v-624v \u00b7 netty/netty@0d0c6ed \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
