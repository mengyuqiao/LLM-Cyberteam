{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29042", "Description": "Translate is a package that allows users to convert text to different languages on Node.js and the browser. Prior to version 3.0.0, an attacker controlling the second variable of the `translate` function is able to perform a cache poisoning attack. They can change the outcome of translation requests made by subsequent users. The `opt.id` parameter allows the overwriting of the cache key. If an attacker sets the `id` variable to the cache key that would be generated by another user, they can choose the response that user gets served. Version 3.0.0 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29042", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/franciscop/translate/commit/cc1ba03078102f83e0503a96f1a081489bb865d3", "ref_desc": "Made the usage options much simpler so that there's no chance of writ\u2026 \u00b7 franciscop/translate@cc1ba03 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/franciscop/translate/commit/7a2bf8b9f05f7c45c09683973ef4d8e995804aa4", "ref_desc": "Made the usage options much simpler so that there's no chance of writ\u2026 \u00b7 franciscop/translate@7a2bf8b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/franciscop/translate/security/advisories/GHSA-882j-4vj5-7vmj", "ref_desc": "Cache Poisoning Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 franciscop/translate \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
