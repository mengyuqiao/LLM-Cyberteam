{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29200", "Description": "Kimai is a web-based multi-user time-tracking application. The permission `view_other_timesheet` performs differently for the Kimai UI and the API, thus returning unexpected data through the API. When setting the `view_other_timesheet` permission to true, on the frontend, users can only see timesheet entries for teams they are a part of. When requesting all timesheets from the API, however, all timesheet entries are returned, regardless of whether the user shares team permissions or not. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.13.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29200", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1220 Insufficient Granularity of Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1220/Insufficient-Granularity-of-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kimai/kimai/security/advisories/GHSA-cj3c-5xpm-cx94", "ref_desc": "API returns timesheet entries a user should not be authorized to view \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kimai/kimai \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
