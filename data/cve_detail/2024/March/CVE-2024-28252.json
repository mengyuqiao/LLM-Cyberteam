{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28252", "Description": "CoreWCF is a port of the service side of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to .NET Core. If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system resources could be consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client doesn't send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted. The bindings affected by this behavior are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding. Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections. The currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found in v1.4.2 and v1.5.2 of the CoreWCF packages. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28252", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/security/advisories/GHSA-32jq-mv89-5rx7", "ref_desc": "CoreWCF NetFraming based services can leave connections open when they should be closed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CoreWCF/CoreWCF \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/issues/1345", "ref_desc": "[Bug]: NetTCP connection doesn't send RST packet when timeout \u00b7 Issue #1345 \u00b7 CoreWCF/CoreWCF \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
