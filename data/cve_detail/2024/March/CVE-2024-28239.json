{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28239", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`. While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message \"Your password needs to be updated\" to phish out the current password. Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28239", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/5477d7d61babd7ffc2f835d399bf79611b15b203", "ref_desc": "Fix URL Redirection in OAuth2/OpenID/SAML (#21238) \u00b7 directus/directus@5477d7d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-fr3w-2p22-6w7p", "ref_desc": "CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site in OAuth2/OpenID \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.directus.io/reference/authentication.html#login-using-sso-providers", "ref_desc": "Authentication | Directus Docs", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
