{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27102", "Description": "Wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. This vulnerability impacts anyone running the affected versions of Wings. The vulnerability can potentially be used to access files and directories on the host system. The full scope of impact is exactly unknown, but reading files outside of a server's base directory (sandbox root) is possible. In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing \"server\" allocated and controlled by Wings. Details on the exploitation of this vulnerability are embargoed until March 27th, 2024 at 18:00 UTC. In order to mitigate this vulnerability, a full rewrite of the entire server filesystem was necessary. Because of this, the size of the patch is massive, however effort was made to reduce the amount of breaking changes. Users are advised to update to version 1.11.9. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27102", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-363 Race Condition Enabling Link Following", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/363/Race-Condition-Enabling-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/d1c0ca526007113a0f74f56eba99511b4e989287", "ref_desc": "server(filesystem): rebuild everything imaginable \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings@d1c0ca5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-494h-9924-xww9", "ref_desc": "Symlink Race in Server Filesystem \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
