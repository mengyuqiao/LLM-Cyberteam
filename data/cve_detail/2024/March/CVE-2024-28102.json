{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28102", "Description": "JWCrypto implements JWK, JWS, and JWE specifications using python-cryptography. Prior to version 1.5.6, an attacker can cause a denial of service attack by passing in a malicious JWE Token with a high compression ratio. When the server processes this token, it will consume a lot of memory and processing time. Version 1.5.6 fixes this vulnerability by limiting the maximum token length.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28102", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto/commit/90477a3b6e73da69740e00b8161f53fea19b831f", "ref_desc": "Address potential DoS with high compression ratio \u00b7 latchset/jwcrypto@90477a3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto/security/advisories/GHSA-j857-7rvv-vj97", "ref_desc": "JWT bomb Attack in `deserialize` function \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 latchset/jwcrypto \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
