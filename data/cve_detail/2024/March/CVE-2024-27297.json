{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27297", "Description": "Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. A fixed-output derivations on Linux can send file descriptors to files in the Nix store to another program running on the host (or another fixed-output derivation) via Unix domain sockets in the abstract namespace. This allows to modify the output of the derivation, after Nix has registered the path as \"valid\" and immutable in the Nix database. In particular, this allows the output of fixed-output derivations to be modified from their expected content. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.3.18 2.18.2 2.19.4 and 2.20.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27297", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/f8170ce9f119e5e6724eb81ff1b5a2d4c0024000", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2ffj-w4mj-pg37 \u00b7 NixOS/nix@f8170ce \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/nix/security/advisories/GHSA-2ffj-w4mj-pg37", "ref_desc": "Corruption of fixed-output derivations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NixOS/nix \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackmd.io/03UGerewRcy3db44JQoWvw", "ref_desc": "FOD sandbox bypass - HackMD", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
