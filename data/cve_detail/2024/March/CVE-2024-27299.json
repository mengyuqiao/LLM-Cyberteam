{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27299", "Description": "phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and other databases. A SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the the \"Add News\" functionality due to improper escaping of the email address. This allows any authenticated user with the rights to add/edit FAQ news to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data, take over accounts and in some cases, even achieve RCE. The vulnerable field lies in the  `authorEmail` field which uses PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` filter. This filter is insufficient in protecting against SQL injection attacks and should still be properly escaped. However, in this version of phpMyFAQ (3.2.5), this field is not escaped properly can be used together with other fields to fully exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.6.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27299", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/1b68a5f89fb65996c56285fa636b818de8608011", "ref_desc": "fix: added missing escapting of value \u00b7 thorsten/phpMyFAQ@1b68a5f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BFL8GHIBxSUxu0TneYf66KjFA0A4RZga?usp=sharing", "ref_desc": "PoC Folder for phpmyfaq - Google Drive", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-qgxx-4xv5-6hcw", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection at \"Save News\" \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 thorsten/phpMyFAQ \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
