{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28860", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Users of IPsec transparent encryption in Cilium may be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks that render the transparent encryption ineffective. In particular, Cilium is vulnerable to chosen plaintext, key recovery, replay attacks by a man-in-the-middle attacker. These attacks are possible due to an ESP sequence number collision when multiple nodes are configured with the same key. Fixed versions of Cilium use unique keys for each IPsec tunnel established between nodes, resolving all of the above attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.13, 1.14.9, and 1.15.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28860", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/network/encryption-ipsec", "ref_desc": "IPsec Transparent Encryption \u2014 Cilium 1.15.3 documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-pwqm-x5x6-5586", "ref_desc": "Insecure IPsec transport encryption in Cilium \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/311fbce5280491cddceab178d83b06fa23688c72", "ref_desc": "ipsec: fix per-node-pair-key computation \u00b7 cilium/cilium@311fbce \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/a652c123331852cca90c74202f993d4170fd37fa", "ref_desc": "ipsec: fix per-node-pair-key computation \u00b7 cilium/cilium@a652c12 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/a1742b478306fa256cd27df1039dfae0537b4149", "ref_desc": "ipsec: fix per-node-pair-key computation \u00b7 cilium/cilium@a1742b4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
