{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28115", "Description": "FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system for microcontrollers. FreeRTOS Kernel versions through 10.6.1 do not sufficiently protect against local privilege escalation via Return Oriented Programming techniques should a vulnerability exist that allows code injection and execution. These issues affect ARMv7-M MPU ports, and ARMv8-M ports with Memory Protected Unit (MPU) support enabled (i.e. `configENABLE_MPU` set to 1). These issues are fixed in version 10.6.2 with a new MPU wrapper.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28115", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbFreertosVersions  before (<) 10.6.2cpe:2.3:o:amazon:freertos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/releases/tag/V10.6.2", "ref_desc": "Release V10.6.2 \u00b7 FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/security/advisories/GHSA-xcv7-v92w-gq6r", "ref_desc": "Potential Privilege Escalation in FreeRTOS Kernel ARMv7-M MPU ports and ARMv8-M ports with MPU support enabled \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel \u00b7 GitHubTechnical Description;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
