{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28111", "Description": "Canarytokens helps track activity and actions on a network. Canarytokens.org supports exporting the history of a Canarytoken's incidents in CSV format. The generation of these CSV files is vulnerable to a CSV Injection vulnerability. This flaw can be used by an attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken to target the Canarytoken's owner, if the owner exports the incident history to CSV and opens in a reader application such as Microsoft Excel. The impact is that this issue could lead to code execution on the machine on which the CSV file is opened. Version sha-c595a1f8 contains a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28111", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1236 Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1236/Improper-Neutralization-of-Formula-Elements-in-a-CSV-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/security/advisories/GHSA-fqh6-v4qp-65fv", "ref_desc": "CSV Injection in exported history CSV files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 thinkst/canarytokens \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/commit/c595a1f884b986da2ca05aa5bff9ae5f93c6a4aa", "ref_desc": "Fix CSV injection vulnerability (#355) \u00b7 thinkst/canarytokens@c595a1f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
