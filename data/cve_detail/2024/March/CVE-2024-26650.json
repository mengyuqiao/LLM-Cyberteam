{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26650", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe\n\np2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. It\nguards the operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallel\nrescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlock\nwhen PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescan\nlocks pci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devices\ncall p2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again.\nHence the deadlock.\n\nTo avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock in p2sb_bar().\nInstead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introduce p2sb_cache_resources()\nfor fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb_bar(),\nrefer the cache and return to the caller.\n\nBefore operating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, check\nthat its device class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCH\nspecifications define. This avoids unexpected operation to other devices\nat the same DEVFN.\n\nTested-by Klara Modin <klarasmodin@gmail.com>", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26650", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-24  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2841631a03652f32b595c563695d0461072e0de4", "ref_desc": "platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/847e1eb30e269a094da046c08273abe3f3361cf2", "ref_desc": "platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d281ac9a987c553d93211b90fd4fe97d8eca32cd", "ref_desc": "platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5913320eb0b3ec88158cfcb0fa5e996bf4ef681b", "ref_desc": "platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
