{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28246", "Description": "KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. Code that uses KaTeX's `trust` option, specifically that provides a function to blacklist certain URL protocols, can be fooled by URLs in malicious inputs that use uppercase characters in the protocol. In particular, this can allow for malicious input to generate `javascript:` links in the output, even if the `trust` function tries to forbid this protocol via `trust: (context) => context.protocol !== 'javascript'`. Upgrade to KaTeX v0.16.10 to remove this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28246", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/184/Incomplete-List-of-Disallowed-Inputs.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/697/Incorrect-Comparison.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/security/advisories/GHSA-3wc5-fcw2-2329", "ref_desc": "Missing normalization of the protocol in URLs allows bypassing forbidden protocols \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 KaTeX/KaTeX \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/commit/fc5af64183a3ceb9be9d1c23a275999a728593de", "ref_desc": "fix: force protocol to be lowercase for better protocol filtering \u00b7 KaTeX/KaTeX@fc5af64 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
