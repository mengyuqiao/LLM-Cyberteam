{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27936", "Description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. Starting in version 1.32.1 and prior to version 1.41.0 of the deno library, maliciously crafted permission request can show the spoofed permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI escape sequence into the request contents. Deno is stripping any ANSI escape sequences from the permission prompt, but permissions given to the program are based on the contents that contain the ANSI escape sequences. Any Deno program can spoof the content of the interactive permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI code, which allows a malicious Deno program to display the wrong file path or program name to the user. Version 1.41.0 of the deno library contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27936", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-150 Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/150/Improper-Neutralization-of-Escape-Meta-or-Control-Sequence.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/78d430103a8f6931154ddbbe19d36f3b8630286d", "ref_desc": "fix(prompt): better output with control chars (#18108) \u00b7 denoland/deno@78d4301 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/7e6b94231290020b55f1d08fb03ea8132781abc5", "ref_desc": "feat(core): highlight unprintable chars in permission prompts (#22468) \u00b7 denoland/deno@7e6b942 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-m4pq-fv2w-6hrw", "ref_desc": "Interactive permission prompt spoofing via improper ANSI stripping \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
