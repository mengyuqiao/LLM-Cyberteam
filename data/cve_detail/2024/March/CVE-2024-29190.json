{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29190", "Description": "Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. In version 3.9.5 Beta and prior, MobSF does not perform any input validation when extracting the hostnames in `android:host`, so requests can also be sent to local hostnames. This can lead to server-side request forgery. An attacker can cause the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure. Commit 5a8eeee73c5f504a6c3abdf2a139a13804efdb77 has a hotfix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29190", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nbKMd2sKosbJef5Mh4DxjcHcQ8Hw0BNR/view?usp=share_link", "ref_desc": "mobsf_ssrf_poc.mov - Google Drive", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/5a8eeee73c5f504a6c3abdf2a139a13804efdb77", "ref_desc": "HOTFIX:[SECURITY] Fix GHSA-wfgj-wrgh-h3r3, dep bump, docker build qa \u00b7 MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF@5a8eeee \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-wfgj-wrgh-h3r3", "ref_desc": "SSRF Vulnerability on assetlinks_check(act_name, well_knowns) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
