{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29041", "Description": "Express.js minimalist web framework for node. Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`. The vulnerability is fixed in 4.19.2 and 5.0.0-beta.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29041", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect;Input validation", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1286 Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1286/Improper-Validation-of-Syntactic-Correctness-of-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc", "ref_desc": "Express.js Open Redirect in malformed URLs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 expressjs/express \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd", "ref_desc": "Prevent open redirect allow list bypass due to encodeurl \u00b7 expressjs/express@0867302 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94", "ref_desc": "Improved fix for open redirect allow list bypass \u00b7 expressjs/express@0b74695 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539", "ref_desc": "[deleted] by FDrag0n \u00b7 Pull Request #5539 \u00b7 expressjs/express \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location", "ref_desc": "Express 4.x - API Reference", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800", "ref_desc": "if \"\\@\" in url \uff0cthe redirect result doesn't match the host of the new URL() \u00b7 Issue #1800 \u00b7 koajs/koa \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
