{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27289", "Description": "pgx is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. Prior to version 4.18.2, SQL injection can occur when all of the following conditions are met: the non-default simple protocol is used; a placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus; there must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder; both must be on the same line; and both parameter values must be user-controlled. The problem is resolved in v4.18.2. As a workaround, do not use the simple protocol or do not place a minus directly before a placeholder.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27289", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jackc/pgx/security/advisories/GHSA-m7wr-2xf7-cm9p", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection via Line Comment Creation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jackc/pgx \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jackc/pgx/commit/f94eb0e2f96782042c96801b5ac448f44f0a81df", "ref_desc": "Always wrap arguments in parentheses in the SQL sanitizer \u00b7 jackc/pgx@f94eb0e \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7qFgQi6EvycArIBN1NXP3Spm1fg.html"}]}
