{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28854", "Description": "tls-listener is a rust lang wrapper around a connection listener to support TLS. With the default configuration of tls-listener, a malicious user can open 6.4 `TcpStream`s a second, sending 0 bytes, and can trigger a DoS. The default configuration options make any public service using `TlsListener::new()` vulnerable to a slow-loris DoS attack. This impacts any publicly accessible service using the default configuration of tls-listener in versions prior to 0.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this by passing a large value, such as `usize::MAX` as the parameter to `Builder::max_handshakes`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28854", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security)", "ref_desc": "Slowloris (computer security) - Wikipedia", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tmccombs/tls-listener/security/advisories/GHSA-2qph-qpvm-2qf7", "ref_desc": "Slow loris vulnerability with default configuration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tmccombs/tls-listener \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tmccombs/tls-listener/commit/d5a7655d6ea9e53ab57c3013092c5576da964bc4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2qph-qpvm-2qf7 \u00b7 tmccombs/tls-listener@d5a7655 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
