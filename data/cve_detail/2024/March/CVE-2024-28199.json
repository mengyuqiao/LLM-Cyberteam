{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28199", "Description": "phlex is an open source framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. This was due to improper case-sensitivity in the code that was meant to prevent these attacks. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all 1.x minor versions. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider configuring a content security policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28199", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) possible with maliciously formed HTML attribute names and values in Phlex \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 phlex-ruby/phlex \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy", "ref_desc": "Content-Security-Policy - HTTP | MDNCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iVP9u078ss022ePkIc6m0timeU8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline", "ref_desc": "Content-Security-Policy - HTTP | MDNCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jBkQ5EIJHK3Jv-0oouG-59BeShQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/aa50c604cdee1d0ce7ef068a4c66cbd5d43f96a1", "ref_desc": "Fix improper case-sensitivity \u00b7 phlex-ruby/phlex@aa50c60 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
