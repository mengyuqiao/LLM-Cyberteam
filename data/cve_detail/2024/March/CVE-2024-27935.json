{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27935", "Description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 1.35.1 and prior to version 1.36.3, a vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior. This affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams, including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly. Version 1.36.3 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27935", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-488 Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/488/Exposure-of-Data-Element-to-Wrong-Session.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/3e9fb8aafd9834ebacd27734cea4310caaf794c6", "ref_desc": "fix(ext/node): simultaneous reads can leak into each other (#20223) \u00b7 denoland/deno@3e9fb8a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-wrqv-pf6j-mqjp", "ref_desc": "Cross-Session Data Contamination in Deno's Node.js Compatibility Runtime \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188", "ref_desc": "\"node:net.Socket\": Data Cross-Reception Issue Between Independent Server-Socket Pairs \u00b7 Issue #20188 \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
