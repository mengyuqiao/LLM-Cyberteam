{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26627", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler\n\nInside scsi_eh_wakeup(), scsi_host_busy() is called & checked with host\nlock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs to be waken up.\n\nThis can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as:\n\n - N hardware queues\n\n - queue depth is M for each hardware queue\n\n - each scsi_host_busy() iterates over (N * M) tag/requests\n\nIf recovery is triggered in case that all requests are in-flight, each\nscsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, when scsi_eh_wakeup() is called\nfor the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy() has been run for (N * M -\n1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M - 1) * (N * M) times.\n\nIf both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can be triggered on acquiring\nhost lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hw queues, queue depth 8169).\n\nFix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy() outside the host lock. We don't\nneed the host lock for getting busy count because host the lock never\ncovers that.\n\n[mkp: Drop unnecessary 'busy' variables pointed out by Bart]", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26627", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d37c1c81419fdef66ebd0747cf76fb8b7d979059", "ref_desc": "scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f5944853f7a961fedc1227dc8f60393f8936d37c", "ref_desc": "scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4373534a9850627a2695317944898eb1283a2db0", "ref_desc": "scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db6338f45971b4285ea368432a84033690eaf53c", "ref_desc": "scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00017.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3842-1] linux-5.10 security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WjQCQKHQLv7zcoqQqsiSVQHq33g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/07e3ca0f17f579491b5f54e9ed05173d6c1d6fcb", "ref_desc": "scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/65ead8468c21c2676d4d06f50b46beffdea69df1", "ref_desc": "scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
