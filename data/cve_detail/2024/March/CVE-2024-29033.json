{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29033", "Description": "OAuthenticator provides plugins for JupyterHub to use common OAuth providers, as well as base classes for writing one's own Authenticators with any OAuth 2.0 provider. `GoogleOAuthenticator.hosted_domain` is used to restrict what Google accounts can be authorized access to a JupyterHub. The restriction is intented to be to Google accounts part of one or more Google organization verified to control specified domain(s). Prior to version 16.3.0, the actual restriction has been to Google accounts with emails ending with the domain. Such accounts could have been created by anyone which at one time was able to read an email associated with the domain. This was described by Dylan Ayrey (@dxa4481) in this [blog post] from 15th December 2023). OAuthenticator 16.3.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, restrict who can login another way, such as `allowed_users` or `allowed_google_groups`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29033", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-55m3-44xf-hg4h", "ref_desc": "GoogleOAuthenticator.hosted_domain incorrectly verifies membership of a Google organizations/workspaces \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterhub/oauthenticator \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of", "ref_desc": "Google OAuth is Broken (Sort Of) \u25c6 Truffle Security Co.", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/commit/5246b09675501b09fb6ed64022099b7644812f60", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-55m3-44xf-hg4h \u00b7 jupyterhub/oauthenticator@5246b09 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
