{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27932", "Description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 1.8.0 and prior to version 1.40.4, Deno improperly checks that an import specifier's hostname is equal to or a child of a token's hostname, which can cause tokens to be sent to servers they shouldn't be sent to. An auth token intended for `example[.]com` may be sent to `notexample[.]com`. Anyone who uses DENO_AUTH_TOKENS and imports potentially untrusted code is affected. Version 1.40.0 contains a patch for this issue", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27932", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-5frw-4rwq-xhcr", "ref_desc": "Improper suffix match testing for DENO_AUTH_TOKENS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/3f4639c330a31741b0efda2f93ebbb833f4f95bc/cli/auth_tokens.rs#L89", "ref_desc": "deno/cli/auth_tokens.rs at 3f4639c330a31741b0efda2f93ebbb833f4f95bc \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/de23e3b60b066481cc390f459497d5bef42a899b", "ref_desc": "fix(cli): Add IP address support to DENO_AUTH_TOKEN (#22297) \u00b7 denoland/deno@de23e3b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
