{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28255", "Description": "OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in, the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately, an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example, a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint, including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28255", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-08  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-04-12  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-04  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/e2043a3f31312ebb42391d6c93a67584d798de52/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/JwtFilter.java#L111", "ref_desc": "OpenMetadata/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/JwtFilter.java at e2043a3f31312ebb42391d6c93a67584d798de52 \u00b7 open-metadata/OpenMetadata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/e2043a3f31312ebb42391d6c93a67584d798de52/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/JwtFilter.java#L113", "ref_desc": "OpenMetadata/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/JwtFilter.java at e2043a3f31312ebb42391d6c93a67584d798de52 \u00b7 open-metadata/OpenMetadata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/security/advisories/GHSA-6wx7-qw5p-wh84", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass (`GHSL-2023-237`) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-metadata/OpenMetadata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
