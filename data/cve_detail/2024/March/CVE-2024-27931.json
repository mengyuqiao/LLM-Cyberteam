{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27931", "Description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. Insufficient validation of parameters in `Deno.makeTemp*` APIs would allow for creation of files outside of the allowed directories. This may allow the user to overwrite important files on the system that may affect other systems. A user may provide a prefix or suffix to a `Deno.makeTemp*` API containing path traversal characters. This is fixed in Deno 1.41.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27931", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Input validation", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-hrqr-jv8w-v9jh", "ref_desc": "Insufficient permission checking in `Deno.makeTemp*` APIs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
