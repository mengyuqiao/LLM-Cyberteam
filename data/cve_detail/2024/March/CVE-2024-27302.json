{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27302", "Description": "go-zero is a web and rpc framework. Go-zero allows user to specify a CORS Filter with a configurable allows param - which is an array of domains allowed in CORS policy. However, the `isOriginAllowed` uses `strings.HasSuffix` to check the origin, which leads to bypass via a malicious domain. This vulnerability is capable of breaking CORS policy and thus allowing any page to make requests and/or retrieve data on behalf of other users. Version 1.4.4 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27302", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/commit/d9d79e930dff6218a873f4f02115df61c38b15db", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-fgxv-gw55-r5fq \u00b7 zeromicro/go-zero@d9d79e9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/security/advisories/GHSA-fgxv-gw55-r5fq", "ref_desc": "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key in go-zero \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zeromicro/go-zero \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
