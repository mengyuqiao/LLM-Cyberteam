{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27918", "Description": "Coder allows oragnizations to provision remote development environments via Terraform. Prior to versions 2.6.1, 2.7.3, and 2.8.4, a vulnerability in Coder's OIDC authentication could allow an attacker to bypass the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` verification and create an account with an email not in the allowlist. Deployments are only affected if the OIDC provider allows users to create accounts on the provider. During OIDC registration, the user's email was improperly validated against the allowed `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN`s. This could allow a user with a domain that only partially matched an allowed domain to successfully login or register. An attacker could register a domain name that exploited this vulnerability and register on a Coder instance with a public OIDC provider.\n\nCoder instances with OIDC enabled and protected by the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` configuration are affected. Coder instances using a private OIDC provider are not affected, as arbitrary users cannot register through a private OIDC provider without first having an account on the provider. Public OIDC providers are impacted. GitHub authentication and external authentication are not impacted. This vulnerability is remedied in versions 2.8.4, 2.7.3, and 2.6.1 All versions prior to these patches are affected by the vulnerability.*It is recommended that customers upgrade their deployments as soon as possible if they are utilizing OIDC authentication with the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` setting.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27918", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/2d37eb42e7db656e343fe1f36de5ab1a1a62f4fb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7cc2-r658-7xpf \u00b7 coder/coder@2d37eb4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/2ba84911f8b02605e5958d5e4a2fe3979ec50b31", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7cc2-r658-7xpf \u00b7 coder/coder@2ba8491 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coder/coder/security/advisories/GHSA-7cc2-r658-7xpf", "ref_desc": "OIDC authentication allows email with partially matching domain to register \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 coder/coder \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/1171ce7add017481d28441575024209ac160ecb0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7cc2-r658-7xpf \u00b7 coder/coder@1171ce7 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/4439a920e454a82565e445e4376c669e3b89591c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7cc2-r658-7xpf \u00b7 coder/coder@4439a92 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
