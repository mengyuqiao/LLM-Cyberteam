{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28864", "Description": "SecureProps is a PHP library designed to simplify the encryption and decryption of property data in objects. A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28864", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/commit/ab7b561040cd37fda3dbf9a6cab01fefcaa16627", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #21 from IlicMiljan/fix-parsing-tagged-encrypted-data \u00b7 IlicMiljan/Secure-Props@ab7b561 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/pull/21", "ref_desc": "Fix Parsing Tagged Encrypted Data by IlicMiljan \u00b7 Pull Request #21 \u00b7 IlicMiljan/Secure-Props \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/security/advisories/GHSA-rj29-j2g4-77q8", "ref_desc": "[TagAwareCipher] - Decryption Failure (Regex Match) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 IlicMiljan/Secure-Props \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/issues/20", "ref_desc": "[BUG] Special Character Handling in `TagAwareCipher` \u00b7 Issue #20 \u00b7 IlicMiljan/Secure-Props \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
