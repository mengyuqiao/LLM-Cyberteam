{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28851", "Description": "The Snowflake Hive metastore connector provides an easy way to query Hive-managed data via Snowflake. Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector has addressed a potential elevation of privilege vulnerability in a `helper script` for the Hive MetaStore Connector. A malicious insider without admin privileges could, in theory, use the script to download content from a Microsoft domain to the local system and replace the valid content with malicious code. If the attacker then also had local access to the same system where the maliciously modified script is run, they could attempt to manipulate users into executing the attacker-controlled helper script, potentially gaining elevated privileges to the local system. The vulnerability in the script was patched on February 09, 2024, without a version bump to the Connector. User who use the helper script are strongly advised to use the latest version as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using the helper script.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28851", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/security/advisories/GHSA-r68p-g2x9-mq7x", "ref_desc": "Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector Security Advisory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/blob/master/scripts/add_snowflake_hive_metastore_connector_script_action.sh", "ref_desc": "snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/scripts/add_snowflake_hive_metastore_connector_script_action.sh at master \u00b7 snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/commit/dfbf87dff456f6bb62c927711d97316f0c71d8ca", "ref_desc": "Update the import command for custom script actions \u00b7 snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector@dfbf87d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
