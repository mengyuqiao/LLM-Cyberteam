{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29188", "Description": "WiX toolset lets developers create installers for Windows Installer, the Windows installation engine. The custom action behind WiX's `RemoveFolderEx` functionality could allow a standard user to delete protected directories. `RemoveFolderEx` deletes an entire directory tree during installation or uninstallation. It does so by recursing every subdirectory starting at a specified directory and adding each subdirectory to the list of directories Windows Installer should delete. If the setup author instructed `RemoveFolderEx` to delete a per-user folder from a per-machine installer, an attacker could create a directory junction in that per-user folder pointing to a per-machine, protected directory. Windows Installer, when executing the per-machine installer after approval by an administrator, would delete the target of the directory junction. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and 4.0.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29188", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-jx4p-m4wm-vvjg", "ref_desc": "Malicious directory junction can cause WiX RemoveFoldersEx to possibly delete elevated files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wixtoolset/issues \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix/commit/2e5960b575881567a8807e6b8b9c513138b19742", "ref_desc": "Don't follow junctions when recursing directories. \u00b7 wixtoolset/wix@2e5960b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/commit/93eeb5f6835776694021f66d4226c262c67d487a", "ref_desc": "Don't follow junctions when recursing directories. \u00b7 wixtoolset/wix3@93eeb5f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
