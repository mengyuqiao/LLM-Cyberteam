{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27097", "Description": "A user endpoint didn't perform filtering on an incoming parameter, which was added directly to the application log. This could lead to an attacker injecting false log entries or corrupt the log file format. This has been fixed in the CKAN versions 2.9.11 and 2.10.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should override the `/user/reset` endpoint to filter the `id` parameter in order to exclude newlines.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27097", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/81b56c55e5e3651d7fcf9642cd5a489a9b62212c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8g38-3m6v-232j \u00b7 ckan/ckan@81b56c5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-8g38-3m6v-232j", "ref_desc": "Potential log injection in reset user endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ckan/ckan \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
