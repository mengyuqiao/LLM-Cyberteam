{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28863", "Description": "node-tar is a Tar for Node.js. node-tar prior to version 6.2.1 has no limit on the number of sub-folders created in the folder creation process. An attacker who generates a large number of sub-folders can consume memory on the system running node-tar and even crash the Node.js client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside. Version 6.2.1 fixes this issue by preventing extraction in excessively deep sub-folders.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28863", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-f5x3-32g6-xq36", "ref_desc": "Denial of service while parsing a tar file due to lack of folders depth validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 isaacs/node-tar \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240524-0005/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-28863 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/fe8cd57da5686f8695415414bda49206a545f7f7", "ref_desc": "prevent extraction in excessively deep subfolders \u00b7 isaacs/node-tar@fe8cd57 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
