{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27938", "Description": "Postal is an open source SMTP server. Postal versions less than 3.0.0 are vulnerable to SMTP Smuggling attacks which may allow incoming e-mails to be spoofed. This, in conjunction with a cooperative outgoing SMTP service, would allow for an incoming e-mail to be received by Postal addressed from a server that a user has 'authorised' to send mail on their behalf but were not the genuine author of the e-mail. Postal is not affected for sending outgoing e-mails as email is re-encoded with `<CR><LF>` line endings when transmitted over SMTP. This issue has been addressed and users should upgrade to Postal v3.0.0 or higher. Once upgraded, Postal will only accept End of DATA sequences which are explicitly `<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>`. If a non-compliant sequence is detected it will be logged to the SMTP server log. There are no workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27938", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/postalserver/postal/commit/0140dc4", "ref_desc": "feat: only accept RFC-compliant End-of-DATA sequence \u00b7 postalserver/postal@0140dc4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sec-consult.com/blog/detail/smtp-smuggling-spoofing-e-mails-worldwide", "ref_desc": "SMTP Smuggling - Spoofing E-Mails Worldwide - SEC Consult", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/postalserver/postal/security/advisories/GHSA-j42r-6c99-hqf2", "ref_desc": "SMTP Smuggling \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 postalserver/postal \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html", "ref_desc": "SMTP SmugglingCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uVCALEWrmbtvNh8lxaJ3lDwZ3oo.html"}]}
