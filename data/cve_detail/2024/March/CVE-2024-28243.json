{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28243", "Description": "KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\\edef` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. This can be used as an availability attack, where e.g. a client rendering another user's KaTeX input will be unable to use the site due to memory overflow, tying up the main thread, or stack overflow. Upgrade to KaTeX v0.16.10 to remove this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28243", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/security/advisories/GHSA-64fm-8hw2-v72w", "ref_desc": "maxExpand bypassed by \\edef \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 KaTeX/KaTeX \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/commit/e88b4c357f978b1bca8edfe3297f0aa309bcbe34", "ref_desc": "fix: \\edef bypassing maxExpand via exponential blowup \u00b7 KaTeX/KaTeX@e88b4c3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
