{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27303", "Description": "electron-builder is a solution to package and build a ready for distribution Electron, Proton Native app for macOS, Windows and Linux. A vulnerability that only affects eletron-builder prior to 24.13.2 in Windows, the NSIS installer makes a system call to open cmd.exe via NSExec in the `.nsh` installer script. NSExec by default searches the current directory of where the installer is located before searching `PATH`. This means that if an attacker can place a malicious executable file named cmd.exe in the same folder as the installer, the installer will run the malicious file. Version 24.13.2 fixes this issue. No known workaround exists. The code executes at the installer-level before the app is present on the system, so there's no way to check if it exists in a current installer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27303", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/security/advisories/GHSA-r4pf-3v7r-hh55", "ref_desc": "NSIS installer - execute arbitrary code on the target machine (Windows only) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 electron-userland/electron-builder \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/8059", "ref_desc": "fix: execute %SYSTEMROOT% cmd.exe directly during NSIS installer by mmaietta \u00b7 Pull Request #8059 \u00b7 electron-userland/electron-builder \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/commit/8f4acff3c2d45c1cb07779bb3fe79644408ee387", "ref_desc": "fix: execute `%SYSTEMROOT%` cmd.exe directly during NSIS installer (#\u2026 \u00b7 electron-userland/electron-builder@8f4acff \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
