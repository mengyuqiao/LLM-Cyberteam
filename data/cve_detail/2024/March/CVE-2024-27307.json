{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27307", "Description": "JSONata is a JSON query and transformation language. Starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.8.7 and 2.0.4, a malicious expression can use the transform operator to override properties on the `Object` constructor and prototype. This may lead to denial of service, remote code execution or other unexpected behavior in applications that evaluate user-provided JSONata expressions. This issue has been fixed in JSONata versions 1.8.7 and 2.0.4. Applications that evaluate user-provided expressions should update ASAP to prevent exploitation. As a workaround, one may apply the patch manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27307", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/commit/1d579dbe99c19fbe509f5ba2c6db7959b0d456d1", "ref_desc": "Prevent writing to the object prototype or constructor (v1 port) (#681) \u00b7 jsonata-js/jsonata@1d579db \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/releases/tag/v2.0.4", "ref_desc": "Release 2.0.4 Maintenance Release \u00b7 jsonata-js/jsonata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/security/advisories/GHSA-fqg8-vfv7-8fj8", "ref_desc": "JSONata expression can pollute the \"Object\" prototype \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jsonata-js/jsonata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/commit/c907b5e517bb718015fcbd993d742ba6202f2be2", "ref_desc": "Prevent access to __proto__ \u00b7 jsonata-js/jsonata@c907b5e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/commit/335d38f6278e96c908b24183f1c9c90afc8ae00c", "ref_desc": "Check for constructor property \u00b7 jsonata-js/jsonata@335d38f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
