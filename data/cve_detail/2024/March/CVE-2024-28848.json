{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28848", "Description": "OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. The `\u200eCompiledRule::validateExpression` method evaluates an SpEL expression using an `StandardEvaluationContext`, allowing the expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as `java.lang.Runtime`, leading to Remote Code Execution. The `/api/v1/policies/validation/condition/<expression>` endpoint passes user-controlled data `CompiledRule::validateExpession` allowing authenticated (non-admin) users to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlaying operating system. In addition, there is a missing authorization check since `Authorizer.authorize()` is never called in the affected path and therefore any authenticated non-admin user is able to trigger this endpoint and evaluate arbitrary SpEL expressions leading to arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-236`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been resolved in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28848", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/security/advisories/GHSA-5xv3-fm7g-865r", "ref_desc": "SpEL Injection in `GET /api/v1/policies/validation/condition/<expr>` (`GHSL-2023-236`) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-metadata/OpenMetadata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/policyevaluator/CompiledRule.java#L51", "ref_desc": "OpenMetadata/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/policyevaluator/CompiledRule.java at main \u00b7 open-metadata/OpenMetadata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-spel-expression-injection", "ref_desc": "Expression language injection (Spring) \u2014 CodeQL query help documentationCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qQ11vR5Ib1YghK4UEdmvijTIg7s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/policyevaluator/CompiledRule.java#L57", "ref_desc": "OpenMetadata/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/policyevaluator/CompiledRule.java at main \u00b7 open-metadata/OpenMetadata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
