{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28101", "Description": "The Apollo Router is a graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation. Versions 0.9.5 until 1.40.2 are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability. When receiving compressed HTTP payloads, affected versions of the Router evaluate the `limits.http_max_request_bytes` configuration option after the entirety of the compressed payload is decompressed. If affected versions of the Router receive highly compressed payloads, this could result in significant memory consumption while the compressed payload is expanded. Router version 1.40.2 has a fix for the vulnerability. Those who are unable to upgrade may be able to implement mitigations at proxies or load balancers positioned in front of their Router fleet (e.g. Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-native WAF services) by creating limits on HTTP body upload size.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28101", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-409 Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/409/Improper-Handling-of-Highly-Compressed-Data-Data-Amplificat.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj", "ref_desc": "Compressed Payloads do not respect HTTP Payload Limits \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 apollographql/router \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/9e9527c73c8f34fc8438b09066163cd42520f413", "ref_desc": "streaming body decompression \u00b7 apollographql/router@9e9527c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
