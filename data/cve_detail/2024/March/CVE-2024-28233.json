{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28233", "Description": "JupyterHub is an open source multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks. By tricking a user into visiting a malicious subdomain, the attacker can achieve an XSS directly affecting the former's session. More precisely, in the context of JupyterHub, this XSS could achieve full access to JupyterHub API and user's single-user server. The affected configurations are single-origin JupyterHub deployments and JupyterHub deployments with user-controlled applications running on subdomains or peer subdomains of either the Hub or a single-user server. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28233", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-565 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/565/Reliance-on-Cookies-without-Validation-and-Integrity-Checkin.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/security/advisories/GHSA-7r3h-4ph8-w38g", "ref_desc": "XSS in JupyterHub via Self-XSS leveraged by Cookie Tossing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterhub/jupyterhub \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/e2798a088f5ad45340fe79cdf1386198e664f77f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7r3h-4ph8-w38g \u00b7 jupyterhub/jupyterhub@e2798a0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
