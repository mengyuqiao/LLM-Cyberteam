{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29916", "Description": "The dormakaba Saflok system before the November 2023 software update allows an attacker to unlock arbitrary doors at a property via forged keycards, if the attacker has obtained one active or expired keycard for the specific property, aka the \"Unsaflok\" issue. This occurs, in part, because the key derivation function relies only on a UID. This affects, for example, Saflok MT, and the Confidant, Quantum, RT, and Saffire series.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29916", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-407 Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/407/Inefficient-Algorithmic-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://unsaflok.com", "ref_desc": "Unsaflok | Unsaflok is a series of serious security vulnerabilities in the Saflok brand of hotel locks.", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cx0RUV7i0s", "ref_desc": "DEF CON 32 - Unsaflok: Hacking millions of hotel locks - Lennert Wouters, Ian Carroll - YouTube", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wired.com/story/saflok-hotel-lock-unsaflok-hack-technique/", "ref_desc": "Hackers Found a Way to Open Any of 3 Million Hotel Keycard Locks in Seconds | WIRED", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39779291", "ref_desc": "Hackers found a way to open any of 3M hotel keycard locks in seconds | Hacker News", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
