{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29036", "Description": "Saleor Storefront is software for building e-commerce experiences. Prior to commit 579241e75a5eb332ccf26e0bcdd54befa33f4783, when any user authenticates in the storefront, anonymous users are able to access their data. The session is leaked through cache and can be accessed by anyone. Users should upgrade to a version that incorporates commit 579241e75a5eb332ccf26e0bcdd54befa33f4783 or later to receive a patch. A possible workaround is to temporarily disable authentication by changing the usage of `createSaleorAuthClient()`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29036", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/saleor/storefront/security/advisories/GHSA-52cq-c7x7-cqw4", "ref_desc": "Session leak in cache \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 saleor/storefront \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/saleor/storefront/commit/579241e75a5eb332ccf26e0bcdd54befa33f4783", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-52cq-c7x7-cqw4 \u00b7 saleor/storefront@579241e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/saleor/auth-sdk/commit/56db13407aa35d00b85ec2df042692edd4aea9da", "ref_desc": "Update README \u00b7 saleor/auth-sdk@56db134 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/saleor/saleor-docs/pull/1120", "ref_desc": "Update auth-sdk docs to make sure instance of the client is not cached across requests by mmiszy \u00b7 Pull Request #1120 \u00b7 saleor/saleor-docs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
