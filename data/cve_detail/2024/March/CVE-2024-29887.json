{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29887", "Description": "Serverpod is an app and web server, built for the Flutter and Dart ecosystem. This bug bypassed the validation of TSL certificates on all none web HTTP clients in the `serverpod_client` package. Making them susceptible to a man in the middle attack against encrypted traffic between the client device and the server. An attacker would need to be able to intercept the traffic and highjack the connection to the server for this vulnerability to be used. Upgrading to version `1.2.6` resolves this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29887", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/security/advisories/GHSA-h6x7-r5rg-x5fw", "ref_desc": "Client accepts any certificate \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 serverpod/serverpod \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/commit/d55bf8d12967fc7955a875cb3e0f9693bd6d2c71", "ref_desc": "fix: Remove faulty certificate check.
