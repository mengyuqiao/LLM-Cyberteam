{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28251", "Description": "Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server. The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching the live status of query executions. Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28251", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/pull/1425", "ref_desc": "fix: enable websocket cors for production by jczhong84 \u00b7 Pull Request #1425 \u00b7 pinterest/querybook \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/security/advisories/GHSA-5349-j4c9-x767", "ref_desc": "Cross-site websocket hijacking \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pinterest/querybook \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
