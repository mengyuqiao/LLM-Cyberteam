{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28231", "Description": "eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, manipulated DATA Submessage can cause a heap overflow error in the Fast-DDS process, causing the process to be terminated remotely. Additionally, the payload_size in the DATA Submessage packet is declared as uint32_t. When a negative number, such as -1, is input into this variable, it results in an Integer Overflow (for example, -1 gets converted to 0xFFFFFFFF). This eventually leads to a heap-buffer-overflow, causing the program to terminate. Versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28231", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/commit/355706386f4af9ce74125eeec3c449b06113112b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-9m2j-qw67-ph4w \u00b7 eProsima/Fast-DDS@3557063 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-9m2j-qw67-ph4w", "ref_desc": "Manipulated DATA Submessage causes a heap-buffer-overflow error \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 eProsima/Fast-DDS \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
