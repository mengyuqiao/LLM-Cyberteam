{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28117", "Description": "Grav is an open-source, flat-file content management system. Prior to version 1.7.45, Grav validates accessible functions through the Utils::isDangerousFunction function, but does not impose restrictions on twig functions like twig_array_map, allowing attackers to bypass the validation and execute arbitrary commands. Twig processing of static pages can be enabled in the front matter by any administrative user allowed to create or edit pages. As the Twig processor runs unsandboxed, this behavior can be used to gain arbitrary code execution and elevate privileges on the instance. Upgrading to patched version 1.7.45 can mitigate this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28117", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/de1ccfa12dbcbf526104d68c1a6bc202a98698fe", "ref_desc": "Mitigate various SSTI injections \u00b7 getgrav/grav@de1ccfa \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/d9ymDzeyVP2ejH7Lp9Y9YuqvL98.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-qfv4-q44r-g7rv", "ref_desc": "Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getgrav/grav \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
