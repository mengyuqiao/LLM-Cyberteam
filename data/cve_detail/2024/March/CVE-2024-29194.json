{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29194", "Description": "OneUptime is a solution for monitoring and managing online services. The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of client-side stored data within the web application. Specifically, the is_master_admin key, stored in the local storage of the browser, can be manipulated by an attacker. By changing this key from false to true, the application grants administrative privileges to the user, without proper server-side validation.  This has been patched in 7.0.1815.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29194", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime/security/advisories/GHSA-246p-xmg8-wmcq", "ref_desc": "Privilege Escalation via Local Storage Key Manipulation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OneUptime/oneuptime \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime/commit/14016d23d834038dd65d3a96cf71af04b556a32c", "ref_desc": "Add deletedByUserId property to several models \u00b7 OneUptime/oneuptime@14016d2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
