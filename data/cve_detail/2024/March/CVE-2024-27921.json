{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27921", "Description": "Grav is an open-source, flat-file content management system. A file upload path traversal vulnerability has been identified in the application prior to version 1.7.45, enabling attackers to replace or create files with extensions like .json, .zip, .css, .gif, etc. This critical security flaw poses severe risks, that can allow attackers to inject arbitrary code on the server, undermine integrity of backup files by overwriting existing files or creating new ones, and exfiltrate sensitive data using CSS exfiltration techniques. Upgrading to patched version 1.7.45 can mitigate the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27921", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-m7hx-hw6h-mqmc", "ref_desc": "File Upload Path Traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getgrav/grav \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/5928411b86bab05afca2b33db4e7386a44858e99", "ref_desc": "fixed path traversal by santize checking fiilename \u00b7 getgrav/grav@5928411 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
