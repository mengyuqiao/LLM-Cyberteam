{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-27917", "Description": "Shopware is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue. The Symfony Session Handler pops the Session Cookie and assigns it to the Response. Since Shopware 6.5.8.0, the 404 pages are cached to improve the performance of 404 pages. So the cached Response which contains a Session Cookie when the Browser accessing the 404 page, has no cookies yet. The Symfony Session Handler is in use, when no explicit Session configuration has been done. When Redis is in use for Sessions using the PHP Redis extension, this exploiting code is not used. Shopware version 6.5.8.7 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, use Redis for Sessions, as this does not trigger the exploit code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27917", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-524 Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/524/Use-of-Cache-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/storefront/commit/3477e4a425d3c54b4bfae82d703fe3838dc21d3e", "ref_desc": "NEXT-34113 - Clear cookies on 404 pages \u00b7 shopware/storefront@3477e4a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/7d9cb03225efca5f97e69b800d8747598dd15ce3", "ref_desc": "NEXT-34113 - Clear cookies on 404 pages \u00b7 shopware/shopware@7d9cb03 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-c2f9-4jmm-v45m", "ref_desc": "Session is persistent in Cache for 404 pages \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/shopware \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/releases/tag/v6.5.8.7", "ref_desc": "Release Security Release v6.5.8.7 \u00b7 shopware/shopware \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
