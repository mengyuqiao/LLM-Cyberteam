{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29187", "Description": "WiX toolset lets developers create installers for Windows Installer, the Windows installation engine. When a bundle runs as SYSTEM user, Burn uses GetTempPathW which points to an insecure directory C:\\Windows\\Temp to drop and load multiple binaries. Standard users can hijack the binary before it's loaded in the application resulting in elevation of privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and 4.0.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29187", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix/commit/75a8c75d4e02ea219008dc5af7d03869291d61f7", "ref_desc": "Protect elevated working folder from malicious data \u00b7 wixtoolset/wix@75a8c75 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-rf39-3f98-xr7r", "ref_desc": "WiX Burn-based bundles are vulnerable to binary hijack when run as SYSTEM \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wixtoolset/issues \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/commit/6d372e5169f1a334a395cdf496443bc0732098e9", "ref_desc": "Protect elevated working folder from malicious data \u00b7 wixtoolset/wix3@6d372e5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
