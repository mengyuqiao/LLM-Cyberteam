{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-26634", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix removing a namespace with conflicting altnames\n\nMark reports a BUG() when a net namespace is removed.\n\n    kernel BUG at net/core/dev.c:11520!\n\nPhysical interfaces moved outside of init_net get \"refunded\"\nto init_net when that namespace disappears. The main interface\nname may get overwritten in the process if it would have\nconflicted. We need to also discard all conflicting altnames.\nRecent fixes addressed ensuring that altnames get moved\nwith the main interface, which surfaced this problem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26634", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2232f29bf52c24f827865b3c90829c44b6c695b", "ref_desc": "net: fix removing a namespace with conflicting altnames - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d09486a04f5da0a812c26217213b89a3b1acf836", "ref_desc": "net: fix removing a namespace with conflicting altnames - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8072699aa9e67d1727692cfb3c347263bb627fb9", "ref_desc": "net: fix removing a namespace with conflicting altnames - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e855dded4b70d1975ee7b9fed0c700391e3c8ea6", "ref_desc": "net: fix removing a namespace with conflicting altnames - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
