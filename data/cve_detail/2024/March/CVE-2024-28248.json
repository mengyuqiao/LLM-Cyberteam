{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28248", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Starting in version 1.13.9 and prior to versions 1.13.13, 1.14.8, and 1.15.2, Cilium's HTTP policies are not consistently applied to all traffic in the scope of the policies, leading to HTTP traffic being incorrectly and intermittently forwarded when it should be dropped. This issue has been patched in Cilium 1.15.2, 1.14.8, and 1.13.13. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28248", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.13.13", "ref_desc": "Release 1.13.13 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/b8XRukXAznOcNzRE7m0u_kGoQI0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-68mj-9pjq-mc85", "ref_desc": "Intermittent HTTP policy bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.14.8", "ref_desc": "Release 1.14.8 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cYlbXwpZV97D8IdjZ-oa8Iii9yQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.15.2", "ref_desc": "Release 1.15.2 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dYz4Tu6flRckpi2lcK_tGNRCrEI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#http", "ref_desc": "Layer 3 Examples \u2014 Cilium 1.15.2 documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
