{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28110", "Description": "Go SDK for CloudEvents is the official CloudEvents SDK to integrate applications with CloudEvents. Prior to version 2.15.2, using cloudevents.WithRoundTripper to create a cloudevents.Client with an authenticated http.RoundTripper causes the go-sdk to leak credentials to arbitrary endpoints. When the transport is populated with an authenticated transport, then http.DefaultClient is modified with the authenticated transport and will start to send Authorization tokens to any endpoint it is used to contact. Version 2.15.2 patches this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28110", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/commit/de2f28370b0d2a0f64f92c0c6139fa4b8a7c3851", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5pf6-2qwx-pxm2 \u00b7 cloudevents/sdk-go@de2f283 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/blob/67e389964131d55d65cd14b4eb32d57a47312695/v2/protocol/http/protocol.go#L104-L110", "ref_desc": "sdk-go/v2/protocol/http/protocol.go at 67e389964131d55d65cd14b4eb32d57a47312695 \u00b7 cloudevents/sdk-go \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/security/advisories/GHSA-5pf6-2qwx-pxm2", "ref_desc": "Use of WithRoundTripper to create a Client leaks credentials \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cloudevents/sdk-go \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
