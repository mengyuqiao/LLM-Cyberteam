{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28195", "Description": "your_spotify is an open source, self hosted Spotify tracking dashboard. YourSpotify versions < 1.9.0 do not protect the API and login flow against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Attackers can use this to execute CSRF attacks on victims, allowing them to retrieve, modify or delete data on the affected YourSpotify instance. Using repeated CSRF attacks, it is also possible to create a new user on the victim instance and promote the new user to instance administrator if a legitimate administrator visits a website prepared by an attacker. Note: Real-world exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the browser version and browser settings in use by the victim. This issue has been addressed in version 1.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28195", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/security/advisories/GHSA-hfgf-99p3-6fjj", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in API and login \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Yooooomi/your_spotify \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/commit/c3ae87673910c9903bb53088c8b71ed2c9aa54e4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hfgf-99p3-6fjj \u00b7 Yooooomi/your_spotify@c3ae876 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
