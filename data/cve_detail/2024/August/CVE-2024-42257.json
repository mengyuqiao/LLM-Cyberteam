The other strings were marked in commit 072ebb3bffe6\n(\"ext4: add nonstring annotations to ext4.h\"). Using strscpy() isn't\nthe right replacement for strncpy(); it should use memtostr_pad()\ninstead.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42257", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.10andbefore (<) 6.10.1cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4378be89ddb7de88d984b67ecfd6191686c42817", "ref_desc": "ext4: use memtostr_pad() for s_volume_name - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/be27cd64461c45a6088a91a04eba5cd44e1767ef", "ref_desc": "ext4: use memtostr_pad() for s_volume_name - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
