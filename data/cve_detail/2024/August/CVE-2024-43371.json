{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43371", "Description": "CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals. There are a number of CKAN plugins, including XLoader, DataPusher, Resource proxy and ckanext-archiver, that work by downloading the contents of local or remote files in order to perform some actions with their contents (e.g. pushing to the DataStore, streaming contents or saving a local copy). All of them use the resource URL, and there are currently no checks to limit what URLs can be requested. This means that a malicious (or unaware) user can create a resource with a URL pointing to a place where they should not have access in order for one of the previous tools to retrieve it (known as a Server Side Request Forgery). Users wanting to protect against these kinds of attacks can use one or a combination of the following approaches: (1) Use a separate HTTP proxy like Squid that can be used to allow / disallow IPs, domains etc as needed, and make CKAN extensions aware of this setting via the ckan.download_proxy config option. (2) Implement custom firewall rules to prevent access to restricted resources. (3) Use custom validators on the resource url field to block/allow certain domains or IPs. All latest versions of the plugins listed above support the ckan.download_proxy settings. Support for this setting in the Resource Proxy plugin was included in CKAN 2.10.5 and 2.11.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43371", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nOkfn\u00bbCkanVersions  before (<) 2.10.5cpe:2.3:a:okfn:ckan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOkfn\u00bbCkanVersions  before (<) 2.10.5cpe:2.3:a:okfn:ckan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-g9ph-j5vj-f8wm", "ref_desc": "Potential access to sensitive URLs via CKAN extensions (SSRF) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ckan/ckan \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
