{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42482", "Description": "fish-shop/syntax-check is a GitHub action for syntax checking fish shell files. Improper neutralization of delimiters in the `pattern` input (specifically the command separator `;` and command substitution characters `(` and `)`) mean that arbitrary command injection is possible by modification of the input value used in a workflow. This has the potential for exposure or exfiltration of sensitive information from the workflow runner, such as might be achieved by sending environment variables to an external entity. It is recommended that users update to the patched version `v1.6.12` or the latest release version `v2.0.0`, however remediation may be possible through careful control of workflows and the `pattern` input value used by this action.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42482", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFish-shop\u00bbSyntax-checkVersions  before (<) 1.6.12cpe:2.3:a:fish-shop:syntax-check:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-140 Improper Neutralization of Delimiters", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/140/Improper-Neutralization-of-Delimiters.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fish-shop/syntax-check/commit/c2cb11395e21119ff8d6e7ea050430ee7d6f49ca", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #90 from fish-shop/harden-action \u00b7 fish-shop/syntax-check@c2cb113 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fish-shop/syntax-check/security/advisories/GHSA-xj87-mqvh-88w2", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Delimiters in fish-shop/syntax-check \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fish-shop/syntax-check \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fish-shop/syntax-check/commit/91e6817c48ad475542fe4e78139029b036a53b03", "ref_desc": "Harden action with escaping and intermediate env var \u00b7 fish-shop/syntax-check@91e6817 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
