{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42354", "Description": "Shopware is an open commerce platform. The store-API works with regular entities and not expose all fields for the public API; fields need to be marked as ApiAware in the EntityDefinition. So only ApiAware fields of the EntityDefinition will be encoded to the final JSON. Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, the processing of the Criteria did not considered ManyToMany associations and so they were not considered properly and the protections didn't get used. This issue cannot be reproduced with the default entities by Shopware, but can be triggered with extensions. Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13 to receive a patch. For older versions of 6.2, 6.3,  and 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42354", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  before (<) 6.5.8.13cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  from including (>=) 6.6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.6.5.1cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/d35ee2eda5c995faeb08b3dad127eab65c64e2a2", "ref_desc": "NEXT-37398 - Improve validation of feature flag name in FeatureCallSi\u2026 \u00b7 shopware/core@d35ee2e \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3C4joRfb8BOYReWWXJigxF7NH1s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-hhcq-ph6w-494g", "ref_desc": "Improper Access Control with ManyToMany associations in store-api \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/shopware \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/a784aa1cec0624e36e0ee4d41aeebaed40e0442f", "ref_desc": "NEXT-37397 - Security picks \u00b7 shopware/core@a784aa1 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dh49-VhYfsMAmFsugcQILZsSLrU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/8504ba7e56e53add6a1d5b9d45015e3d899cd0ac", "ref_desc": "NEXT-37397 - Security picks \u00b7 shopware/shopware@8504ba7 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PfUnTxE3oIktQy1ryoolzyjlyHA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/ad83d38809df457efef21c37ce0996430334bf01", "ref_desc": "NEXT-37527 - Consider many to many assosications for store-api protec\u2026 \u00b7 shopware/shopware@ad83d38 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
