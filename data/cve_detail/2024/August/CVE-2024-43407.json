{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43407", "Description": "CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A potential vulnerability has been discovered in CKEditor 4 Code Snippet GeSHi plugin. The vulnerability allowed a reflected XSS attack by exploiting a flaw in the GeSHi syntax highlighter library hosted by the victim. The GeSHi library was included as a vendor dependency in CKEditor 4 source files. In a specific scenario, an attacker could craft a malicious script that could be executed by sending a request to the GeSHi library hosted on a PHP web server. The GeSHi library is no longer actively maintained. Due to the lack of ongoing support and updates, potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with its continued use. To mitigate these risks and enhance the overall security of the CKEditor 4, we have decided to completely remove the GeSHi library as a dependency. This change aims to maintain a secure environment and reduce the risk of any security incidents related to outdated or unsupported software. The fix is be available in version 4.25.0-lts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43407", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCkeditor\u00bbCkeditorVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andbefore (<) 4.25.0-ltscpe:2.3:a:ckeditor:ckeditor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCkeditor\u00bbCkeditor\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andbefore (<) 4.25.0cpe:2.3:a:ckeditor:ckeditor:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/commit/71072c9f7f263329841bd38e7e5309074c82ef94", "ref_desc": "Remove `plugins/codesnippetgeshi/dev` directory \u00b7 ckeditor/ckeditor4@71072c9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/commit/951e7d75fcbcaa2590b0719fb0bb0dd0539ca6fa", "ref_desc": "Add note to codesnippetgeshi `README.md` file \u00b7 ckeditor/ckeditor4@951e7d7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-7r32-vfj5-c2jv", "ref_desc": "Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Code Snippet GeSHi plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ckeditor/ckeditor4 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
