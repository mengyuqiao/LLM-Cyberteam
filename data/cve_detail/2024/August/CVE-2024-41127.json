{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41127", "Description": "Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain pull-requests write access. The ci-failure-comment.yml workflow is triggered when the Monkey CI workflow completes. When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of ./pr_num/pr_num.txt artifact to the steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content WorkFlow variable. It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed. This issue leads to pull-requests write access. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.30.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41127", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMonkeytype\u00bbMonkeytypeVersions  before (<) 24.30.0cpe:2.3:a:monkeytype:monkeytype:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMonkeytype\u00bbMonkeytypeVersions  before (<) 24.30.0cpe:2.3:a:monkeytype:monkeytype:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-12  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/commit/29627fd0d5f152e2da59671987090ea0a5c29874", "ref_desc": "ci: update ci-failure-comment workflow (@fehmer) (#5632) \u00b7 monkeytypegame/monkeytype@29627fd \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/security/advisories/GHSA-wcjf-5464-4wq9", "ref_desc": "Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its `ci-failure-comment.yml` GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain `pull-requests` write access. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 moVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-167_monkeytype", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2024-167: Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in Monkeytype - CVE-2024-41127 | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
