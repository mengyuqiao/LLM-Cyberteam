{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42490", "Description": "authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42490", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-qxqc-27pr-wgc8", "ref_desc": "Insufficient Authorization for several API endpoints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/359b343f51524342a5ca03828e7c975a1d654b11", "ref_desc": "security: fix CVE-2024-42490 (cherry-pick #11022) (#11025) \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik@359b343 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/19318d4c00bb02c4ec3c4f8f15ac2e1dbe8d846c", "ref_desc": "security: fix CVE-2024-42490 (cherry-pick #11022) (#11024) \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik@19318d4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
