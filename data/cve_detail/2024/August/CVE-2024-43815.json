{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43815", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: mxs-dcp - Ensure payload is zero when using key slot\n\nWe could leak stack memory through the payload field when running\nAES with a key from one of the hardware's key slots. Fix this by\nensuring the payload field is set to 0 in such cases.\n\nThis does not affect the common use case when the key is supplied\nfrom main memory via the descriptor payload.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43815", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1640fed0377bf7276efb70d03cb821a6931063d", "ref_desc": "crypto: mxs-dcp - Ensure payload is zero when using key slot - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd52b5eeb0f70893f762da7254e923fd23fd1379", "ref_desc": "crypto: mxs-dcp - Ensure payload is zero when using key slot - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
