{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40892", "Description": "A weak credential vulnerability exists in Firewalla Box Software versions before 1.979. This vulnerability allows a physically close attacker to use the license UUID for authentication and provision SSH credentials over the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BTLE) interface. Once an attacker gains access to the LAN, they could log into the SSH interface using the provisioned credentials. The license UUID can be acquired through plain-text Bluetooth sniffing, reading the QR code on the bottom of the device, or brute-forcing the UUID (though this is less likely).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40892", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1391 Use of Weak Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1391/Use-of-Weak-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://vulncheck.com/advisories/firewalla-bt-weak-credentials", "ref_desc": "Firewalla BTLE Weak Credentials | VulnCheck Advisories", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2024-08-20-bluuid-firewalla/", "ref_desc": "GreyNoise Labs - BLUUID: Firewallas, Diabetics, And\u2026 BluetoothCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NvSiQgv8N_e68lIQgd0LxsBybB8.html"}]}
