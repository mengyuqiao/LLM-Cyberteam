{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42347", "Description": "matrix-react-sdk  is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. A malicious homeserver could manipulate a user's account data to cause the client to enable URL previews in end-to-end encrypted rooms, in which case any URLs in encrypted messages would be sent to the server. This was patched in matrix-react-sdk 3.105.0. Deployments that trust their homeservers, as well as closed federations of trusted servers, are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42347", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbReact SdkVersions  before (<) 3.105.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:react_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMatrix\u00bbMatrix-react-sdkVersions  before (<) 3.105.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix-react-sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-359 Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/359/Exposure-of-Private-Personal-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/releases/tag/v3.105.1", "ref_desc": "Release v3.105.1 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-f83w-wqhc-cfp4", "ref_desc": "URL preview setting for a room is controllable by the homeserver \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
