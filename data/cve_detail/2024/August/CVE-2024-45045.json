{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45045", "Description": "Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology. In the mobile (Android/iOS) device variants of Collabora Online it was possible to inject JavaScript via url encoded values in links contained in documents. Since the Android JavaScript interface allows access to internal functions, the likelihood that the app could be compromised via this vulnerability is considered high. Non-mobile variants are not affected. Mobile variants should update to the latest version provided by the platform appstore. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45045", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCollabora\u00bbOnlineVersions  before (<) 24.04.6.2cpe:2.3:a:collabora:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Google\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCollabora\u00bbOnline\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 24.04.6.2cpe:2.3:a:collabora:online:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-04  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-84 Improper Neutralization of Encoded URI Schemes in a Web Page", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/84/Improper-Neutralization-of-Encoded-URI-Schemes-in-a-Web-Page.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/security/advisories/GHSA-78cg-rg4q-26qv", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-45045 JavaScript Injection via url encoded values in links \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CollaboraOnline/online \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
