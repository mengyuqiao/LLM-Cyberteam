{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41957", "Description": "Vim is an open source command line text editor. Vim < v9.1.0647 has double free in src/alloc.c:616. When closing a window, the corresponding tagstack data will be cleared and freed. However a bit later, the quickfix list belonging to that window will also be cleared and if that quickfix list points to the same tagstack data, Vim will try to free it again, resulting in a double-free/use-after-free access exception. Impact is low since the user must intentionally execute vim with several non-default flags,\nbut it may cause a crash of Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0647", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41957", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nVIM\u00bbVIMVersions  before (<) 9.1.0647cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-10  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-415 Double Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/415/Double-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-f9cr-gv85-hcr4", "ref_desc": "use-after-free in tagstack_clear_entry() in Vim < v9.1.0647 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vim/vim \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/8a0bbe7b8aad6f8da28dee218c01bc8a0185a", "ref_desc": "patch 9.1.0647: [security] use-after-free in tagstack_clear_entry \u00b7 vim/vim@8a0bbe7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
