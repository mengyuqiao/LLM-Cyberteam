{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43367", "Description": "Boa is an embeddable and experimental Javascript engine written in Rust. Starting in version 0.16 and prior to version 0.19.0, a wrong assumption made when handling ECMAScript's `AsyncGenerator` operations can cause an uncaught exception on certain scripts. Boa's implementation of `AsyncGenerator` makes the assumption that the state of an `AsyncGenerator` object cannot change while resolving a promise created by methods of `AsyncGenerator` such as `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.next`, `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.return`, or `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.throw`. However, a carefully constructed code could trigger a state transition from a getter method for the promise's `then` property, which causes the engine to fail an assertion of this assumption, causing an uncaught exception. This could be used to create a Denial Of Service attack in applications that run arbitrary ECMAScript code provided by an external user. Version 0.19.0 is patched to correctly handle this case. Users unable to upgrade to the patched version would want to use `std::panic::catch_unwind` to ensure any exceptions caused by the engine don't impact the availability of the main application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43367", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/commit/69ea2f52ed976934bff588d6b566bae01be313f7", "ref_desc": "Fix AsyncGenerator to correctly handle `return` inside `then` (#3879) \u00b7 boa-dev/boa@69ea2f5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/security/advisories/GHSA-g38c-wh3c-5h9r", "ref_desc": "JavaScript specification issue may lead to type confusion, pointer dereference, and uncaught exception in implementations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tc39/ecma262 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ibrF-dhjDtwL8Psazr1lfjmWIIY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/security/advisories/GHSA-f67q-wr6w-23jq", "ref_desc": "Uncaught exception when transitioning the state of `AsyncGenerator` objects from within a property getter of `then` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 boa-dev/boa \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uTM-7R-NPpW14ukMNXFLdJJvm_Q.html"}]}
