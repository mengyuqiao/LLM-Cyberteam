{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43881", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: change DMA direction while mapping reinjected packets\n\nFor fragmented packets, ath12k reassembles each fragment as a normal\npacket and then reinjects it into HW ring. In this case, the DMA\ndirection should be DMA_TO_DEVICE, not DMA_FROM_DEVICE. Otherwise,\nan invalid payload may be reinjected into the HW and\nsubsequently delivered to the host.\n\nGiven that arbitrary memory can be allocated to the skb buffer,\nknowledge about the data contained in the reinjected buffer is lacking.\nConsequently, there\u2019s a risk of private information being leaked.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.1.1-00209-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43881", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/33322e3ef07409278a18c6919c448e369d66a18e", "ref_desc": "wifi: ath12k: change DMA direction while mapping reinjected packets - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6925320fcd40d8042d32bf4ede8248e7a5315c3b", "ref_desc": "wifi: ath12k: change DMA direction while mapping reinjected packets - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e99d9b16ff153de9540073239d24adc3b0a3a997", "ref_desc": "wifi: ath12k: change DMA direction while mapping reinjected packets - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
