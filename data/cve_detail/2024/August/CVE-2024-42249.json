This\ncan corrupt the message while it is being used by the controller driver.\n\nspi_maybe_unoptimize_message() is already called in the correct place\nin spi_finalize_current_message() to balance the call to\nspi_maybe_optimize_message() in spi_async().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42249", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.9andbefore (<) 6.9.10cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b9af6d67517ce4a0015928b3cf35bfd2b1bc1c2", "ref_desc": "spi: don't unoptimize message in spi_async() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c86a918b1bdba78fb155184f8d88dfba1e63335d", "ref_desc": "spi: don't unoptimize message in spi_async() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
