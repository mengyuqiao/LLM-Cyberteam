{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43168", "Description": "DISPUTE NOTE: this issue does not pose a security risk as it (according to analysis by the original software developer, NLnet Labs) falls within the expected functionality and security controls of the application. Red Hat has made a claim that there is a security risk within Red Hat products. NLnet Labs has no further information about the claim, and suggests that affected Red Hat customers refer to available Red Hat documentation or support channels. ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: A heap-buffer-overflow flaw was found in the cfg_mark_ports function within Unbound's config_file.c, which can lead to memory corruption. This issue could allow an attacker with local access to provide specially crafted input, potentially causing the application to crash or allowing arbitrary code execution. This could result in a denial of service or unauthorized actions on the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43168", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2303462", "ref_desc": "2303462 \u2013 (CVE-2024-43168) CVE-2024-43168 unbound: Heap-Buffer-Overflow in Unbound", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/pull/1040/files", "ref_desc": "fix heap-buffer-overflow issue in function cfg_mark_ports of file util/config_file.c by xiaoxiaoafeifei \u00b7 Pull Request #1040 \u00b7 NLnetLabs/unbound \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-43168", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-43168- Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/issues/1039", "ref_desc": "a heap-buffer-overflow issue in function cfg_mark_ports of file util/config_file.c \u00b7 Issue #1039 \u00b7 NLnetLabs/unbound \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
