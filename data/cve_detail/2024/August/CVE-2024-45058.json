{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45058", "Description": "i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. Prior to the 2.9 branch, an attacker with only minimal viewing privileges in the settings section is able to change their user type to Administrator (or another type with super-permissions) through a specifically crafted POST request to `/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, modifying the `nivel_usuario_` parameter. The vulnerability occurs in the file located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, which does not check the user's current permission level before allowing changes. Commit c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45058", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPortabilis\u00bbI-educarVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.9cpe:2.3:a:portabilis:i-educar:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/commit/c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e", "ref_desc": "Adiciona valida\u00e7\u00e3o para verificar se o usu\u00e1rio pode modificar os dados \u00b7 portabilis/i-educar@c25910c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/security/advisories/GHSA-53vj-fq8x-2mvg", "ref_desc": "Escala\u00e7\u00e3o de Privil\u00e9gios \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 portabilis/i-educar \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
