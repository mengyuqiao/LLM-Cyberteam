{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42353", "Description": "WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses. When WebOb normalizes the HTTP Location header to include the request hostname, it does so by parsing the URL that the user is to be redirected to with Python's urlparse, and joining it to the base URL. `urlparse` however treats a `//` at the start of a string as a URI without a scheme, and then treats the next part as the hostname. `urljoin` will then use that hostname from the second part as the hostname replacing the original one from the request. This vulnerability is patched in WebOb version 1.8.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42353", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPylonsproject\u00bbWebobVersions  before (<) 1.8.8cpe:2.3:a:pylonsproject:webob:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-20  0.06%  0.05%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/webob/commit/f689bcf4f0a1f64f1735b1d5069aef5be6974b5b", "ref_desc": "Add fix for open redirect \u00b7 Pylons/webob@f689bcf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/webob/security/advisories/GHSA-mg3v-6m49-jhp3", "ref_desc": "Location header normalization during redirect leads to open redirect \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Pylons/webob \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
