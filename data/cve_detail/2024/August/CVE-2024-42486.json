{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42486", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. In versions on the 1.15.x branch prior to 1.15.8 and the 1.16.x branch prior to 1.16.1, ReferenceGrant changes are not correctly propagated in Cilium's GatewayAPI controller, which could lead to Gateway resources being able to access secrets for longer than intended, or to Routes having the ability to forward traffic to backends in other namespaces for longer than intended. This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.15.8 and v1.16.1. As a workaround, any modification of a related Gateway/HTTPRoute/GRPCRoute/TCPRoute CRD (for example, adding any label to any of these resources) will trigger a reconciliation of ReferenceGrants on an affected cluster.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42486", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/34032", "ref_desc": "gateway-api: Enqueue gateway for Reference Grant changes by sayboras \u00b7 Pull Request #34032 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/ed3dfa0aab8b80f7e841a6d49d2a990ac2dca053", "ref_desc": "gateway-api: Enqueue gateway for Reference Grant changes \u00b7 cilium/cilium@ed3dfa0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-vwf8-q6fw-4wcm", "ref_desc": "Gateway resources continue to establish sessions using revoked ReferenceGrants \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
