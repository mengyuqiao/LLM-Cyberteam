{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42487", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. In the 1.15 branch prior to 1.15.8 and the 1.16 branch prior to 1.16.1, Gateway API HTTPRoutes and GRPCRoutes do not follow the match precedence specified in the Gateway API specification. In particular, request headers are matched before request methods, when the specification describes that the request methods must be respected before headers are matched. This could result in unexpected behaviour with security This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.15.8 and v1.16.1. There is no workaround for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42487", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.15.0andbefore (<) 1.15.8cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCilium\u00bbVersion:1.16.0cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:1.16.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/113/Improper-Neutralization-of-CRLF-Sequences-in-HTTP-Headers-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/a3510fe4a92305822aa1a5e08cb6d6c873c8699a", "ref_desc": "gateway-api: Add HTTP method condition in sortable routes \u00b7 cilium/cilium@a3510fe \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/34109", "ref_desc": "gateway-api: Add HTTP method condition in sortable routes by sayboras \u00b7 Pull Request #34109 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-qcm3-7879-xcww", "ref_desc": "Gateway API route matching order contradicts specification \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
