{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42469", "Description": "openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1, CometVisu's file system endpoints don't require authentication and additionally the endpoint to update an existing file is susceptible to path traversal. This makes it possible for an attacker to overwrite existing files on the openHAB instance. If the overwritten file is a shell script that is executed at a later time, this vulnerability can allow remote code execution by an attacker. Users should upgrade to version 4.2.1 to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42469", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpenhab\u00bbOpenhabVersions  before (<) 4.2.1cpe:2.3:a:openhab:openhab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenhab\u00bbOpenhabVersions  before (<) 4.2.1cpe:2.3:a:openhab:openhab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-13  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui/commit/630e8525835c698cf58856aa43782d92b18087f2", "ref_desc": "[cometvisu] Security fixes & cleanup for cometvisu backend (#2671) \u00b7 openhab/openhab-webui@630e852 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/c8TnirmqhDbVXutJWT7cvRrN5a0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui/security/advisories/GHSA-f729-58x4-gqgf", "ref_desc": "RCE through path traversal (CometVisu) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openhab/openhab-webui \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
