{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41432", "Description": "An IP Spoofing vulnerability has been discovered in Likeshop up to 2.5.7.20210811. This issue allows an attacker to replace their real IP address with any arbitrary IP address, specifically by adding a forged 'X-Forwarded' or 'Client-IP' header to requests. Exploiting IP spoofing, attackers can bypass account lockout mechanisms during attempts to log into admin accounts, spoof IP addresses in requests sent to the server, and impersonate IP addresses that have logged into user accounts, etc.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41432", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLikeshop\u00bbLikeshopVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.5.7.20210811cpe:2.3:a:likeshop:likeshop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLikeshop\u00bbLikeshopVersions  before (<) 2.5.7.20210811cpe:2.3:a:likeshop:likeshop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gitlab.com/c2at3/cve-2024-41432/-/blob/main/README.md", "ref_desc": "README.md \u00b7 main \u00b7 Tran Ba Quang / CVE-2024-41432 \u00b7 GitLabExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
