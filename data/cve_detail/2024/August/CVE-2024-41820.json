{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41820", "Description": "Kubean is a cluster lifecycle management toolchain based on kubespray and other cluster LCM engine. The ClusterRole has `*` verbs of `*` resources. If a malicious user can access the worker node which has kubean's deployment, he/she can abuse these excessive permissions to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster, resulting in a cluster-level privilege escalation. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.18.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41820", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/security/advisories/GHSA-3wfj-3x8q-hrpg", "ref_desc": "A potential risk of kubean which can be leveraged to make a cluster-level privilege escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kubean-io/kubean \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/commit/167e97329e4a27ba2f456d2846d39af20e1af7ef", "ref_desc": "fix CVE-2024-41820 \u00b7 kubean-io/kubean@167e973 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/issues/1326", "ref_desc": "software bug: too excessive clusterrole privilege \u00b7 Issue #1326 \u00b7 kubean-io/kubean \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
