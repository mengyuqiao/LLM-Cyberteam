{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45043", "Description": "The OpenTelemetry Collector module AWS firehose receiver is for ingesting AWS Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream messages and parsing the records received based on the configured record type. `awsfirehosereceiver` allows unauthenticated remote requests, even when configured to require a key. OpenTelemetry Collector can be configured to receive CloudWatch metrics via an AWS Firehose Stream. Firehose sets the header `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` with an arbitrary configured string. The OpenTelemetry Collector awsfirehosereceiver can optionally be configured to require this key on incoming requests. However, when this is configured it **still accepts incoming requests with no key**. Only OpenTelemetry Collector users configured with the \u201calpha\u201d `awsfirehosereceiver` module are affected. This module was added in version v0.49.0 of the \u201cContrib\u201d distribution (or may be included in custom builds). There is a risk of unauthorized users writing metrics. Carefully crafted metrics could hide other malicious activity. There is no risk of exfiltrating data. It\u2019s likely these endpoints will be exposed to the public internet, as Firehose does not support private HTTP endpoints. A fix was introduced in PR #34847 and released with v0.108.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45043", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/34847", "ref_desc": "[receiver/awsfirehose]: Fix access key validation by Aneurysm9 \u00b7 Pull Request #34847 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-prf6-xjxh-p698", "ref_desc": "AWS Firehose Receiver Authentication Bypass Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/awsfirehosereceiver", "ref_desc": "opentelemetry-collector-contrib/receiver/awsfirehosereceiver at main \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/tag/v0.108.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.108.0 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#alpha", "ref_desc": "GitHub - open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector: OpenTelemetry Collector", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib", "ref_desc": "opentelemetry-collector-releases/distributions/otelcol-contrib at main \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-http", "ref_desc": "Controlling access with Amazon Data Firehose - Amazon Data Firehose", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html", "ref_desc": "Understand HTTP endpoint delivery request and response specifications - Amazon Data Firehose", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/pull/74", "ref_desc": "[receiver/awsfirehose] Add AWS Firehose receiver to contrib manifest. by jefchien \u00b7 Pull Request #74 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
