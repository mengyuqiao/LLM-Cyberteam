{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42488", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Prior to versions 1.14.14 and 1.15.8, a race condition in the Cilium agent can cause the agent to ignore labels that should be applied to a node. This could in turn cause CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicies intended for nodes with the ignored label to not apply, leading to policy bypass. This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.14.14 and v1.15.8 As the underlying issue depends on a race condition, users unable to upgrade can restart the Cilium agent on affected nodes until the affected policies are confirmed to be working as expected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42488", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  before (<) 1.14.14cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.15.0andbefore (<) 1.15.8cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/33511", "ref_desc": "fix: Track node labels propagated to the endpoint manager correctly by skmatti \u00b7 Pull Request #33511 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-q7w8-72mr-vpgw", "ref_desc": "Policy bypass for Host Firewall policy due to race condition in Cilium agent \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/aa44dd148a9be95e07782e4f990e61678ef0abf8", "ref_desc": "Track node labels propagated to the endpoint manager correctly \u00b7 cilium/cilium@aa44dd1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
