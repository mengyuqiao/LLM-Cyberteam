{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41909", "Description": "Like many other SSH implementations, Apache MINA SSHD suffered from the issue that is more widely known as CVE-2023-48795. An attacker that can intercept traffic between client and server could drop certain packets from the stream, potentially causing client and server to consequently end up with a connection for which \nsome security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin \nattack\n\nThe mitigations to prevent this type of attack were implemented in Apache MINA SSHD 2.12.0, both client and server side. Users are recommended to upgrade to at least this version. Note that both the client and the server implementation must have mitigations applied against this issue, otherwise the connection may still be affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41909", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbMina SshdVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.11.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:mina_sshd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-31  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-354 Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/354/Improper-Validation-of-Integrity-Check-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/vwf1ot8wx1njyy8n19j5j2tcnjnozt3b", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-41909: Apache MINA SSHD: integrity check bypass-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/mina-sshd/issues/445", "ref_desc": "Terrapin Mitigation: \"strict-kex\" \u00b7 Issue #445 \u00b7 apache/mina-sshd \u00b7 GitHubIssue TrackingCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pJ4Xqj9KnQuSv-75Hhr6eqKxJc0.html"}]}
