{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43840", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, arm64: Fix trampoline for BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG\n\nWhen BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is set, the trampoline calls\n__bpf_tramp_enter() and __bpf_tramp_exit() functions, passing them\nthe struct bpf_tramp_image *im pointer as an argument in R0.\n\nThe trampoline generation code uses emit_addr_mov_i64() to emit\ninstructions for moving the bpf_tramp_image address into R0, but\nemit_addr_mov_i64() assumes the address to be in the vmalloc() space\nand uses only 48 bits. Because bpf_tramp_image is allocated using\nkzalloc(), its address can use more than 48-bits, in this case the\ntrampoline will pass an invalid address to __bpf_tramp_enter/exit()\ncausing a kernel crash.\n\nFix this by using emit_a64_mov_i64() in place of emit_addr_mov_i64()\nas it can work with addresses that are greater than 48-bits.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43840", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.10.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6d218fcc707d6b2c3616b6cd24b948fd4825cfec", "ref_desc": "bpf, arm64: Fix trampoline for BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19d3c179a37730caf600a97fed3794feac2b197b", "ref_desc": "bpf, arm64: Fix trampoline for BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
