{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43410", "Description": "Russh is a Rust SSH client & server library. Allocating an untrusted amount of memory allows any unauthenticated user to OOM a russh server. An SSH packet consists of a 4-byte big-endian length, followed by a byte stream of this length.\nAfter parsing and potentially decrypting the 4-byte length, russh allocates enough memory for this bytestream, as a performance optimization to avoid reallocations later. But this length is entirely untrusted and can be set to any value by the client, causing this much memory to be allocated, which will cause the process to OOM within a few such requests. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.44.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43410", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Eugeny/russh/commit/f660ea3f64b86d11d19e33076012069f02431e55", "ref_desc": "fixed GHSA-vgvv-x7xg-6cqg - OOM Denial of Service due to allocation o\u2026 \u00b7 Eugeny/russh@f660ea3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Eugeny/russh/security/advisories/GHSA-vgvv-x7xg-6cqg", "ref_desc": "OOM Denial of Service due to allocation of untrusted amount \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Eugeny/russh \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
