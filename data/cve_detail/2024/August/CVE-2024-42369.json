{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42369", "Description": "matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's getRoomUpgradeHistory function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug. This was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42369", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbJavascript Sdk\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 34.3.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:javascript_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nMatrix\u00bbJavascript SdkVersions  before (<) 34.3.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:javascript_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-vhr5-g3pm-49fm", "ref_desc": "A room with itself as a its predecessor will freeze matrix-js-sdk \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/a0efed8b881b3db6c9f2c71d6a6e74c2828978c6", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk@a0efed8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
