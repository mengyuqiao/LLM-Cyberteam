{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41226", "Description": "A CSV injection vulnerability in Automation Anywhere Automation 360 version 21094 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload. NOTE: Automation Anywhere disputes this report, arguing the attacker executes everything from the client side and does not attack the Control Room. The payload is being injected in the http Response from the client-side, so the owner of the Response and payload is the end user in this case. They contend that the server's security controls have no impact or role to play in this situation and therefore this is not a valid vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41226", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAutomationanywhere\u00bbAutomation 360\u00bbVersion:21094cpe:2.3:a:automationanywhere:automation_360:21094:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1236 Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1236/Improper-Neutralization-of-Formula-Elements-in-a-CSV-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.automationanywhere.com/products/automation-360", "ref_desc": "Automation 360 Platform | RPA Bot | Automation AnywhereProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CKNGzUKB9SF8IeLHJ0UgBD-tN4E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://medium.com/%40aksalsalimi/cve-2024-41226-response-manipulation-led-to-csv-injection-9ae3182dcc02", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024\u201341226: Response manipulation led to CSV Injection | by Ahmed Alsalimi | Aug, 2024 | MediumExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
