{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43379", "Description": "TruffleHog is a secrets scanning tool. Prior to v3.81.9, this vulnerability allows a malicious actor to craft data in a way that, when scanned by specific detectors, could trigger the detector to make an unauthorized request to an endpoint chosen by the attacker. For an exploit to be effective, the target endpoint must be an unauthenticated GET endpoint that produces side effects. The victim must scan the maliciously crafted data and have such an endpoint targeted for the exploit to succeed. The vulnerability has been resolved in TruffleHog v3.81.9 and later versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43379", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTrufflesecurity\u00bbTrufflehogVersions  before (<) 3.81.9cpe:2.3:a:trufflesecurity:trufflehog:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/fe5624c70923355128868cffd647b6e2cfe11443", "ref_desc": "Improve domain / url handling in detectors (#3221) \u00b7 trufflesecurity/trufflehog@fe5624c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/security/advisories/GHSA-3r74-v83p-f4f4", "ref_desc": "Blind SSRF in some Detectors \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 trufflesecurity/trufflehog \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
