{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45036", "Description": "Tophat is a mobile applications testing harness. An Improper Access Control vulnerability can expose the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` token stored in `~/.tophatrc` through use of a malicious Tophat URL controlled by the attacker. The vulnerability allows Tophat to send this token to the attacker's server without any checks to ensure that the server is trusted. This token can then be used to access internal build artifacts, for mobile applications, not intended to be public. The issue has been patched as of version 1.10.0.  The ability to request artifacts using a Tophat API has been deprecated as this flow was inherently insecure.  Systems that have implemented this kind of endpoint should cease use and invalidate the token immediately. There are no workarounds and all users should update as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45036", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/security/advisories/GHSA-p7xh-6hjr-mmg6", "ref_desc": "Improper Access Control Vulnerability When Accessing a Maliciously Crafted Tophat Link \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Shopify/tophat \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Shopify/tophat/pull/10", "ref_desc": "Deprecate support for API endpoint artifact retrieval by lfroms \u00b7 Pull Request #10 \u00b7 Shopify/tophat \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
