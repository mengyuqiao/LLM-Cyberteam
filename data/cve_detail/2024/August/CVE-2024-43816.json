{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43816", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Revise lpfc_prep_embed_io routine with proper endian macro usages\n\nOn big endian architectures, it is possible to run into a memory out of\nbounds pointer dereference when FCP targets are zoned.\n\nIn lpfc_prep_embed_io, the memcpy(ptr, fcp_cmnd, sgl->sge_len) is\nreferencing a little endian formatted sgl->sge_len value.  So, the memcpy\ncan cause big endian systems to crash.\n\nRedefine the *sgl ptr as a struct sli4_sge_le to make it clear that we are\nreferring to a little endian formatted data structure.  And, update the\nroutine with proper le32_to_cpu macro usages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43816", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9fd003f344d502f65252963169df3dd237054e49", "ref_desc": "scsi: lpfc: Revise lpfc_prep_embed_io routine with proper endian macro usages - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8bc7c617642db6d8d20ee671fb6c4513017e7a7e", "ref_desc": "scsi: lpfc: Revise lpfc_prep_embed_io routine with proper endian macro usages - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
