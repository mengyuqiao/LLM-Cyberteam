{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43373", "Description": "webcrack is a tool for reverse engineering javascript. An arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in the webcrack module when processing specifically crafted malicious code on Windows systems. This vulnerability is triggered when using the unpack bundles feature in conjunction with the saving feature. If a module name includes a path traversal sequence with Windows path separators, an attacker can exploit this to overwrite files on the host system. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary `.js` files to the host system, which can be leveraged to hijack legitimate Node.js modules to gain arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.14.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43373", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nJ4k0xb\u00bbWebcrackVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.14.0cpe:2.3:a:j4k0xb:webcrack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJ4k0xb\u00bbWebcrack\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.14.1cpe:2.3:a:j4k0xb:webcrack:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/j4k0xb/webcrack/blob/241f9469e6401f3dabc6373233d85a5e76966b54/packages/webcrack/src/unpack/bundle.ts#L79", "ref_desc": "webcrack/packages/webcrack/src/unpack/bundle.ts at 241f9469e6401f3dabc6373233d85a5e76966b54 \u00b7 j4k0xb/webcrack \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/j4k0xb/webcrack/commit/4bc5c6f353012ee7edc2cb39d01a728ab7426999", "ref_desc": "fix: path traversal on windows \u00b7 j4k0xb/webcrack@4bc5c6f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/j4k0xb/webcrack/security/advisories/GHSA-ccqh-278p-xq6w", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability in webcrack on Windows when Parsing and Saving a Malicious Bundle \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 j4k0xb/webcrack \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
