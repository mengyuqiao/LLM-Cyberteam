{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41677", "Description": "Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. A potential mutation XSS vulnerability exists in Qwik for versions up to but not including 1.6.0. Qwik improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the rules found in the `render-ssr.ts` file. It sometimes causes the situation that the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Qwik expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS). This has been resolved in qwik version 1.6.0 and @builder.io/qwik version 1.7.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41677", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBuilder\u00bbQwikVersions  before (<) 1.7.3cpe:2.3:a:builder:qwik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nQwikdev\u00bbQwikVersions  before (<) 1.6.0cpe:2.3:a:qwikdev:qwik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nQwik\u00bbQwik\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.7.3cpe:2.3:a:qwik:qwik:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/blob/v1.5.5/packages/qwik/src/core/render/ssr/render-ssr.ts#L1182-L1208", "ref_desc": "qwik/packages/qwik/src/core/render/ssr/render-ssr.ts at v1.5.5 \u00b7 QwikDev/qwik \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/security/advisories/GHSA-2rwj-7xq8-4gx4", "ref_desc": "Potential mXSS vulnerability due to improper HTML escaping \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 QwikDev/qwik \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/commit/7e742eb3a1001542d795776c0317d47df8b9d64e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2rwj-7xq8-4gx4 \u00b7 QwikDev/qwik@7e742eb \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
