{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42319", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmailbox: mtk-cmdq: Move devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable()\n\nWhen mtk-cmdq unbinds, a WARN_ON message with condition\npm_runtime_get_sync() < 0 occurs.\n\nAccording to the call tracei below:\n  cmdq_mbox_shutdown\n  mbox_free_channel\n  mbox_controller_unregister\n  __devm_mbox_controller_unregister\n  ...\n\nThe root cause can be deduced to be calling pm_runtime_get_sync() after\ncalling pm_runtime_disable() as observed below:\n1. CMDQ driver uses devm_mbox_controller_register() in cmdq_probe()\n   to bind the cmdq device to the mbox_controller, so\n   devm_mbox_controller_unregister() will automatically unregister\n   the device bound to the mailbox controller when the device-managed\n   resource is removed. That means devm_mbox_controller_unregister()\n   and cmdq_mbox_shoutdown() will be called after cmdq_remove().\n2. CMDQ driver also uses devm_pm_runtime_enable() in cmdq_probe() after\n   devm_mbox_controller_register(), so that devm_pm_runtime_disable()\n   will be called after cmdq_remove(), but before\n   devm_mbox_controller_unregister().\n\nTo fix this problem, cmdq_probe() needs to move\ndevm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable() to make\ndevm_pm_runtime_disable() be called after\ndevm_mbox_controller_unregister().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42319", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/11fa625b45faf0649118b9deaf2d31c86ac41911", "ref_desc": "mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Move devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8bd68e4329f9a0ad1b878733e0f80be6a971649", "ref_desc": "mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Move devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
