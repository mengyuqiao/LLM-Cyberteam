{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42318", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlandlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer\n\nWhen a process' cred struct is replaced, this _almost_ always invokes\nthe cred_prepare LSM hook; but in one special case (when\nKEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT updates the parent's credentials), the\ncred_transfer LSM hook is used instead.  Landlock only implements the\ncred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causes\nall information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.\n\nThis basically means that a process with the ability to use the fork()\nand keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions on\nitself.\n\nFix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as the\nexisting cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare()\ncall hook_cred_transfer() so that the two functions are less likely to\naccidentally diverge in the future.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42318", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16896914bace82d7811c62f3b6d5320132384f49", "ref_desc": "landlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2566", "ref_desc": "Sign in - Google Accounts", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240817.shahka3Ee1iy@digikod.net/", "ref_desc": "Landlock Houdini fix: CVE-2024-42318 - Micka\u00ebl Sala\u00fcn", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39705a6c29f8a2b93cf5b99528a55366c50014d1", "ref_desc": "landlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b14cc2cf313bd29056fadbc8ecd7f957cf5791ff", "ref_desc": "landlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/916c648323fa53b89eedb34a0988ddaf01406117", "ref_desc": "landlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d74fd54db0bd0c0c224bef0da8fc95ea9c9f36c", "ref_desc": "landlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/17/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Landlock Houdini fix: CVE-2024-42318", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
