{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41960", "Description": "mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. An authenticated admin user can inject a JavaScript payload into the Relay Hosts configuration. The injected payload is executed whenever the configuration page is viewed, enabling the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to data theft, or further exploitation. This issue has been addressed in the `2024-07` release. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41960", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMailcow\u00bbMailcow: DockerizedVersions  before (<) 2024-07cpe:2.3:a:mailcow:mailcow\\:_dockerized:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMailcow\u00bbMailcow: DockerizedVersions  before (<) 2024-07cpe:2.3:a:mailcow:mailcow\\:_dockerized:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-jpp8-rhg6-4vvv", "ref_desc": "XSS Vulnerability via Relay Hosts Configuration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/commit/efb2572f0fa57628ad98a76a4ae884a10cac0a1a", "ref_desc": "[Web] escapeHtml in relayhosts table \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized@efb2572 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
