{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42467", "Description": "openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1, the proxy endpoint of openHAB's CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication. This proxy-feature can be exploited as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers, in case openHAB is exposed in a non-private network. Furthermore, this proxy-feature can also be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as an attacker is able to re-route a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code. Since the browser receives this data directly from the openHAB CometVisu UI, this JavaScript code will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI. This allows an attacker to exploit call endpoints on an openHAB server even if the openHAB server is located in a private network. (e.g. by sending an openHAB admin a link that proxies malicious JavaScript.) This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities. Users should upgrade to version 4.2.1 of the CometVisu add-on of openHAB to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42467", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpenhab\u00bbOpenhabVersions  before (<) 4.2.1cpe:2.3:a:openhab:openhab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenhab\u00bbOpenhab Web InterfaceVersions  before (<) 4.2.1cpe:2.3:a:openhab:openhab_web_interface:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-30  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui/commit/630e8525835c698cf58856aa43782d92b18087f2", "ref_desc": "[cometvisu] Security fixes & cleanup for cometvisu backend (#2671) \u00b7 openhab/openhab-webui@630e852 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/c8TnirmqhDbVXutJWT7cvRrN5a0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui/blob/1c03c60f84388b9d7da0231df2d4ebb1e17d3fcf/bundles/org.openhab.ui.cometvisu/src/main/java/org/openhab/ui/cometvisu/internal/backend/rest/ProxyResource.java#L83", "ref_desc": "openhab-webui/bundles/org.openhab.ui.cometvisu/src/main/java/org/openhab/ui/cometvisu/internal/backend/rest/ProxyResource.java at 1c03c60f84388b9d7da0231df2d4ebb1e17d3fcf \u00b7 openhab/openhab-webui \u00b7 GitProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui/security/advisories/GHSA-v7gr-mqpj-wwh3", "ref_desc": "SSRF/XSS (CometVisu) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openhab/openhab-webui \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
