{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43825", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table\n\nThe sorting in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table is not working as intended.\nIt could result in an out-of-bounds access when the time is zero.\n\nHere are more details:\n\n1. When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, e.g., the time\nsequence is `3, 0, 1`, the inner for-loop will not terminate and do\nout-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new`, the value\n`new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will be\nmoved to `j+1` position, which makes the if-condition always hold.\nMeanwhile, idx will be added one, making the loop keep running without\ntermination and out-of-bound write.\n2. If none of the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, the elements\nwill just be copied without being sorted as described in the comment\n\"Sort times from all tables to one and remove duplicates\".\n\nFor more details, please refer to\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/6dd0d822-046c-4dd2-9532-79d7ab96ec05@gmail.com.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43825", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.7andbefore (<) 6.10.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.4andbefore (<) 6.6.44cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-01  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5acc3f971a01be48d5ff4252d8f9cdb87998cdfb", "ref_desc": "iio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b5046de32fd1532c3f67065197fc1da82f0b5193", "ref_desc": "iio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31ff8464ef540785344994986a010031410f9ff3", "ref_desc": "iio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
