{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41964", "Description": "Kirby is a CMS targeting designers and editors. Kirby allows to restrict the permissions of specific user roles. Users of that role can only perform permitted actions. Permissions for creating and deleting languages have already existed and could be configured, but were not enforced by Kirby's frontend or backend code. A permission for updating existing languages has not existed before the patched versions. So disabling the languages.* wildcard permission for a role could not have prohibited updates to existing language definitions. The missing permission checks allowed attackers with Panel access to manipulate the language definitions. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.6.6.6, Kirby 3.7.5.5, Kirby 3.8.4.4, Kirby 3.9.8.2, Kirby 3.10.1.1, and Kirby 4.3.1. Please update to one of these or a later version to fix the vulnerability. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41964", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.3.1cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.9.0andbefore (<) 3.9.8.2cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.7.0andbefore (<) 3.7.5.5cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.10.0andbefore (<) 3.10.1.1cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.8.0andbefore (<) 3.8.4.4cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  before (<) 3.6.6.6cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/ab95d172667c3cd529917c2bc94d3c7969706d23", "ref_desc": "Fix language permissions #6497 \u00b7 getkirby/kirby@ab95d17 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-jm9m-rqr3-wfmh", "ref_desc": "Insufficient permission checks in the language settings \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
