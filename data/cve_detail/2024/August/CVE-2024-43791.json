{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43791", "Description": "RequestStore provides per-request global storage for Rack. The files published as part of request_store 1.3.2 have 0666 permissions, meaning that they are world-writable, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code. This version was published in 2017, and most production environments do not allow access for local users, so the chances of this being exploited are very low, given that the vast majority of users will have upgraded, and those that have not, if any, are not likely to be exposed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43791", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSteveklabnik\u00bbRequest Store\u00bbVersion:1.3.2cpe:2.3:a:steveklabnik:request_store:1.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store/security/advisories/GHSA-frp2-5qfc-7r8m", "ref_desc": "Incorrect Default Permissions in request_store 1.3.2 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 steveklabnik/request_store \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
