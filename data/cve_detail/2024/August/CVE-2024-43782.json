{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43782", "Description": "This openedx-translations repository contains translation files from Open edX repositories to be kept in sync with Transifex. Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43782", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenedx\u00bbOpenedx-translations\u00bbVersion:cpe:2.3:a:openedx:openedx-translations:0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenedx\u00bbOpenedx\u00bbVersion:Redwood1cpe:2.3:a:openedx:openedx:redwood1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenedx\u00bbOpenedx\u00bbVersion:Redwood2cpe:2.3:a:openedx:openedx:redwood2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-13  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/3c4093705dec99590577c4d8270ce263f7fffc5a", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 openedx/openedx-translations@3c40937 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/security/advisories/GHSA-fg8c-2pvj-wx3j", "ref_desc": "Atlas translations for Open edX missing validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openedx/openedx-translations \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/b2444340e8702c7955310331c1db5fd85b25b92b", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 openedx/openedx-translations@b244434 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
