{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41996", "Description": "Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate the order of the public key.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41996", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/c0r0n3r/abccc14d4d96c0442f3a77fa5ca255d1", "ref_desc": "Diffie-Hellman public key validation references \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/faq/", "ref_desc": "Frequently Asked Questions | D(HE)at Attack", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/details/", "ref_desc": "Technical Details | D(HE)at Attack", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
