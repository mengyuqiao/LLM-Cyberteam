{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42357", "Description": "Shopware is an open commerce platform. Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, the Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the `aggregations` object. The `name` field in this `aggregations` object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using SQL parameters. Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13 to receive a patch. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42357", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  before (<) 6.5.8.13cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  from including (>=) 6.6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.6.5.1cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/a784aa1cec0624e36e0ee4d41aeebaed40e0442f", "ref_desc": "NEXT-37397 - Security picks \u00b7 shopware/core@a784aa1 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dh49-VhYfsMAmFsugcQILZsSLrU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-p6w9-r443-r752", "ref_desc": "Blind SQL-injection in DAL aggregations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/shopware \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/63c05615694790f5790a04ef889f42b764fa53c9", "ref_desc": "NEXT-37397 - Improve Aggregation name validation \u00b7 shopware/core@63c0561 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/8504ba7e56e53add6a1d5b9d45015e3d899cd0ac", "ref_desc": "NEXT-37397 - Security picks \u00b7 shopware/shopware@8504ba7 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PfUnTxE3oIktQy1ryoolzyjlyHA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/57ea2f3c59483cf7c0f853e7a0d68c23ded1fe5b", "ref_desc": "NEXT-37397 - Improve Aggregation name validation \u00b7 shopware/shopware@57ea2f3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
