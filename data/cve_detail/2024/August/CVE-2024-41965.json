{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41965", "Description": "Vim is an open source command line text editor. double-free in dialog_changed() in Vim < v9.1.0648. When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask the user what to do with the modified buffer. If the user wants the changed buffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer did not have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim will falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly later to a heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41965", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nVIM\u00bbVIMVersions  before (<) 9.1.0648cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-415 Double Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/415/Double-Free.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-46pw-v7qw-xc2f", "ref_desc": "double-free in dialog_changed() in Vim < v9.1.0648 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vim/vim \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/b29f4abcd4b3382fa746edd1d0562b7b48c", "ref_desc": "patch 9.1.0648: [security] double-free in dialog_changed() \u00b7 vim/vim@b29f4ab \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
