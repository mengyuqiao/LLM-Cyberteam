{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43381", "Description": "reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. Versions 2.1.2 and prior are susceptible to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when scanning a domain, and if the target domain's DNS record contains an XSS payload, it leads to the execution of malicious scripts in the reNgine's dashboard view when any user views the scan results. The XSS payload is directly fetched from the DNS record of the remote target domain. Consequently, an attacker can execute the attack without requiring any additional input from the target or the reNgine user. A patch is available and expected to be part of version 2.1.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43381", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRengine Project\u00bbRengineVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:rengine_project:rengine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nYogeshojha\u00bbRengineVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:yogeshojha:rengine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nYogeshojha\u00bbRengineVersions  before (<) 2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:yogeshojha:rengine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-12  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-87 Improper Neutralization of Alternate XSS Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/87/Improper-Neutralization-of-Alternate-XSS-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/commit/064bac1c7c4d2b90745bf225c92e74d83edb7a4d", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 yogeshojha/rengine@064bac1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/security/advisories/GHSA-96q4-fj2m-jqf7", "ref_desc": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via DNS Record Poisoning \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yogeshojha/rengine \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
