{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43369", "Description": "Ibexa RichText Field Type is a Field Type for supporting rich formatted text stored in a structured XML format. In versions on the 4.6 branch prior to 4.6.10, the validator for the RichText fieldtype blocklists `javascript:` and `vbscript:` in links to prevent XSS. This can leave other options open, and the check can be circumvented using upper case. Content editing permissions for RichText content is required to exploit this vulnerability, which typically means Editor role or higher. The fix implements an allowlist instead, which allows only approved link protocols. The new check is case insensitive. Version 4.6.10 contains a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43369", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ibexa/fieldtype-richtext/commit/0a3b830e8806d5169f697351fdc48ffd95a25c67", "ref_desc": "Merge branch '2.3' into 4.6 \u00b7 ibexa/fieldtype-richtext@0a3b830 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ibexa/fieldtype-richtext/commit/59e9c1a9da60597f60cf7338bf289dccaa7e27ca", "ref_desc": "Merge branch '2.3' into 4.6 \u00b7 ibexa/fieldtype-richtext@59e9c1a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ibexa/fieldtype-richtext/security/advisories/GHSA-hvcf-6324-cjh7", "ref_desc": "Persistent XSS in RichText \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ibexa/fieldtype-richtext \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-richtext/security/advisories/GHSA-rhm7-7469-rcpw", "ref_desc": "Persistent XSS in RichText \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ezsystems/ezplatform-richtext \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developers.ibexa.co/security-advisories/ibexa-sa-2024-005-persistent-xss-in-richtext", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory IBEXA-SA-2024-005: Persistent XSS in RichText", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
