{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43167", "Description": "DISPUTE NOTE: this issue does not pose a security risk as it (according to analysis by the original software developer, NLnet Labs) falls within the expected functionality and security controls of the application. Red Hat has made a claim that there is a security risk within Red Hat products. NLnet Labs has no further information about the claim, and suggests that affected Red Hat customers refer to available Red Hat documentation or support channels. ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ub_ctx_set_fwd function in Unbound. This issue could allow an attacker who can invoke specific sequences of API calls to cause a segmentation fault. When certain API functions such as ub_ctx_set_fwd and ub_ctx_resolvconf are called in a particular order, the program attempts to read from a NULL pointer, leading to a crash. This issue can result in a denial of service by causing the application to terminate unexpectedly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43167", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/pull/1073/files", "ref_desc": "fix null pointer dereference issue in function ub_ctx_set_fwd by xiaoxiaoafeifei \u00b7 Pull Request #1073 \u00b7 NLnetLabs/unbound \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2303456", "ref_desc": "Bug Access Denied", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/issues/1072", "ref_desc": "Null pointer dereference issue in function ub_ctx_set_fwd of file libunbound/libunbound.c \u00b7 Issue #1072 \u00b7 NLnetLabs/unbound \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-43167", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-43167- Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
