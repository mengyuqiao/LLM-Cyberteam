{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43366", "Description": "zkvyper is a Vyper compiler. Starting in version 1.3.12 and prior to version 1.5.3, since LLL IR has no Turing-incompletness restrictions, it is compiled to a loop with a much more late exit condition. It leads to a loss of funds or other unwanted behavior if the loop body contains it. However, more real-life use cases like iterating over an array are not affected. No contracts were affected by this issue, which was fixed in version 1.5.3. Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way to avoid the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43366", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatter-labs\u00bbZkvyperVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.12andbefore (<) 1.5.3cpe:2.3:a:matter-labs:zkvyper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-8j77-7rrv-6pxx", "ref_desc": "Ignored loop range bounds \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matter-labs/era-compiler-vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
