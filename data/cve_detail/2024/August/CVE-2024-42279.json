{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42279", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: microchip-core: ensure TX and RX FIFOs are empty at start of a transfer\n\nWhile transmitting with rx_len == 0, the RX FIFO is not going to be\nemptied in the interrupt handler. A subsequent transfer could then\nread crap from the previous transfer out of the RX FIFO into the\nstart RX buffer. The core provides a register that will empty the RX and\nTX FIFOs, so do that before each transfer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42279", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3feda3677e8bbe833c3a62a4091377a08f015b80", "ref_desc": "spi: microchip-core: ensure TX and RX FIFOs are empty at start of a transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9cf71eb0faef4bff01df4264841b8465382d7927", "ref_desc": "spi: microchip-core: ensure TX and RX FIFOs are empty at start of a transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/45e03d35229b680b79dfea1103a1f2f07d0b5d75", "ref_desc": "spi: microchip-core: ensure TX and RX FIFOs are empty at start of a transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
