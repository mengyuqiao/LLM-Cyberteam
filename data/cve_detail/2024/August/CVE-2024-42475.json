{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42475", "Description": "In the OAuth library for nim prior to version 0.11, the `state` values generated by the `generateState` function do not have sufficient entropy. These can be successfully guessed by an attacker allowing them to perform a CSRF vs a user, associating the user's session with the attacker's protected resources. While `state` isn't exactly a cryptographic value, it should be generated in a cryptographically secure way. `generateState` should be using a CSPRNG. Version 0.11 modifies the `generateState` function to generate `state` values of at least 128 bits of entropy while using a CSPRNG.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42475", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CORDEA/oauth/security/advisories/GHSA-332c-q46h-fg8f", "ref_desc": "Insecure generation of state values by generateState - entropy too low and uses regular PRNG instead of CSPRNG \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CORDEA/oauth \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CORDEA/oauth/blob/b8c163b0d9cfad6d29ce8c1fb394e5f47182ee1c/src/oauth2.nim#L179", "ref_desc": "oauth/src/oauth2.nim at b8c163b0d9cfad6d29ce8c1fb394e5f47182ee1c \u00b7 CORDEA/oauth \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
