{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42368", "Description": "OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel, is a vendor-neutral open source Observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. The bearertokenauth extension's server authenticator performs a simple, non-constant time string comparison of the received & configured bearer tokens. This impacts anyone using the `bearertokenauth` server authenticator. Malicious clients with network access to the collector may perform a timing attack against a collector with this authenticator to guess the configured token, by iteratively sending tokens and comparing the response time. This would allow an attacker to introduce fabricated or bad data into the collector's telemetry pipeline. The observable timing vulnerability was fixed by using constant-time comparison in  0.107.0", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42368", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/commit/c9bd3eff0bb357d9c812a0d8defd3b09db95699a", "ref_desc": "[extension/bearertokenauth] use constant time comparison (#34516) \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib@c9bd3ef \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/34516", "ref_desc": "[extension/bearertokenauth] use constant time comparison by codeboten \u00b7 Pull Request #34516 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-rfxf-mf63-cpqv", "ref_desc": "Observable Timing Discrepancy in github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/extension/bearertokenauthextension \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
