{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45056", "Description": "zksolc is a Solidity compiler for ZKsync. All LLVM versions since 2015 fold `(xor (shl 1, x), -1)` to `(rotl ~1, x)` if run with optimizations enabled. Here `~1` is generated as an unsigned 64 bits number (`2^64-1`). This number is zero-extended to 256 bits on EraVM target while it should have been sign-extended. Thus instead of producing `roti 2^256 - 1, x` the compiler produces `rotl 2^64 - 1, x`. Analysis has shown that no contracts were affected by the date of publishing this advisory. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.3. Users are advised to upgrade and redeploy all contracts. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45056", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatter-labs\u00bbEra-compiler-solidityVersions  before (<) 1.5.3cpe:2.3:a:matter-labs:era-compiler-solidity:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMatter-labs\u00bbZksolcVersions  before (<) 1.5.3cpe:2.3:a:matter-labs:zksolc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-04  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/682/Incorrect-Calculation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/e48237df95b49a36b8ffceb78c8a58f4be1b4344", "ref_desc": "DAGCombiner: fold (xor (shl 1, x), -1) -> (rotl ~1, x) \u00b7 llvm/llvm-project@e48237d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity/security/advisories/GHSA-fpx7-8vc6-frjj", "ref_desc": "`fold (xor (shl 1, x), -1) -> (rotl ~1, x)` misoptimization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matter-labs/era-compiler-solidity \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
