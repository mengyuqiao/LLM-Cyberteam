{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42367", "Description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.10.2, static routes which contain files with compressed variants (`.gz` or `.br` extension) are vulnerable to path traversal outside the root directory if those variants are symbolic links. The server protects static routes from path traversal outside the root directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default).  It does this by resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that path relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when looking for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and symbolic links are then automatically followed when performing the `Path.stat()` and `Path.open()` to send the file. Version 3.10.2 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42367", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/61/UNIX-Symbolic-Link-Symlink-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/e0ff5246e1d29b7710ab1a2bbc972b48169f1c05/aiohttp/web_fileresponse.py#L177", "ref_desc": "aiohttp/aiohttp/web_fileresponse.py at e0ff5246e1d29b7710ab1a2bbc972b48169f1c05 \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/e0ff5246e1d29b7710ab1a2bbc972b48169f1c05/aiohttp/web_urldispatcher.py#L674", "ref_desc": "aiohttp/aiohttp/web_urldispatcher.py at e0ff5246e1d29b7710ab1a2bbc972b48169f1c05 \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8653", "ref_desc": "[PR #8652/b0536ae6 backport][3.10] Do not follow symlinks for compressed file variants by patchback[bot] \u00b7 Pull Request #8653 \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/ce2e9758814527589b10759a20783fb03b98339f", "ref_desc": "[PR #8652/b0536ae6 backport][3.10] Do not follow symlinks for compres\u2026 \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp@ce2e975 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-jwhx-xcg6-8xhj", "ref_desc": "Compressed files as symlinks are not protected from path traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
