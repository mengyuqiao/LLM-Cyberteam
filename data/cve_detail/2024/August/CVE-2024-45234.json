{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45234", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) an ROA or a Manifest containing a signedAttrs encoded in non-canonical form. This bypasses Fort's BER decoder, reaching a point in the code that panics when faced with data not encoded in DER. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a panic can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to compromised routing.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45234", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFort Validator Project\u00bbFort ValidatorVersions  before (<) 1.6.3cpe:2.3:a:fort_validator_project:fort_validator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNicmx\u00bbFort-validatorVersions  before (<) 1.6.3cpe:2.3:a:nicmx:fort-validator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/CVE.html", "ref_desc": "CVE | FORT Validator - RPKI Relying PartyThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4jQyPxhwWqQo5omPvRu_tfso44o.html"}]}
