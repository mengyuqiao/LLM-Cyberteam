{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45037", "Description": "The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source framework for defining cloud infrastructure using code. Customers use it to create their own applications which are converted to AWS CloudFormation templates during deployment to a customer\u2019s AWS account. CDK contains pre-built components called \"constructs\" that are higher-level abstractions providing defaults and best practices. This approach enables developers to use familiar programming languages to define complex cloud infrastructure more efficiently than writing raw CloudFormation templates. We identified an issue in AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) which, under certain conditions, can result in granting authenticated Amazon Cognito users broader than intended access. Specifically, if a CDK application uses the \"RestApi\" construct with \"CognitoUserPoolAuthorizer\" as the authorizer and uses authorization scopes to limit access. This issue does not affect the availability of the specific API resources. Authenticated Cognito users may gain unintended access to protected API resources or methods, leading to potential data disclosure, and modification issues.  Impacted versions: >=2.142.0;<=2.148.0. A patch is included in CDK versions >=2.148.1. Users are advised to upgrade their AWS CDK version to 2.148.1 or newer and re-deploy their application(s) to address this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45037", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v2.148.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.148.1 \u00b7 aws/aws-cdk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/security/advisories/GHSA-qj85-69xf-2vxq", "ref_desc": "AWS CDK RestApi Construct: Authenticated users may have unintended access to protected APIs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aws/aws-cdk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html", "ref_desc": "What is the AWS CDK? - AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) v2", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/4bee768f07e73ab5fe466f9ad3d1845456a0513b", "ref_desc": "fix(apigateway): authorization scope is not added when not explicitly\u2026 \u00b7 aws/aws-cdk@4bee768 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
