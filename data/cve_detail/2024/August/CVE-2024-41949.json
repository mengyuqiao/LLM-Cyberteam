{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41949", "Description": "biscuit-rust is the Rust implementation of Biscuit, an authentication and authorization token for microservices architectures. Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a ThirdPartyBlock request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it, which includes the public key of the previous block (used in the signature) and the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41949", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBiscuitsec\u00bbBiscuit-auth\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:biscuitsec:biscuit-auth:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBiscuitsec\u00bbBiscuit-rustVersions  before (<) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:biscuitsec:biscuit-rust:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit-rust/security/advisories/GHSA-p9w4-585h-g3c7", "ref_desc": "Public key confusion in third party block \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 biscuit-auth/biscuit-rust \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
