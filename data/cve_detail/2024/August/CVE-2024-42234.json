{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42234", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migration\n\nEven on 6.10-rc6, I've been seeing elusive \"Bad page state\"s (often on\nflags when freeing, yet the flags shown are not bad: PG_locked had been\nset and cleared??), and VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)s from\ndeferred_split_scan()'s folio_put(), and a variety of other BUG and WARN\nsymptoms implying double free by deferred split and large folio migration.\n\n6.7 commit 9bcef5973e31 (\"mm: memcg: fix split queue list crash when large\nfolio migration\") was right to fix the memcg-dependent locking broken in\n85ce2c517ade (\"memcontrol: only transfer the memcg data for migration\"),\nbut missed a subtlety of deferred_split_scan(): it moves folios to its own\nlocal list to work on them without split_queue_lock, during which time\nfolio->_deferred_list is not empty, but even the \"right\" lock does nothing\nto secure the folio and the list it is on.\n\nFortunately, deferred_split_scan() is careful to use folio_try_get(): so\nfolio_migrate_mapping() can avoid the race by folio_undo_large_rmappable()\nwhile the old folio's reference count is temporarily frozen to 0 - adding\nsuch a freeze in the !mapping case too (originally, folio lock and\nunmapping and no swap cache left an anon folio unreachable, so no freezing\nwas needed there: but the deferred split queue offers a way to reach it).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42234", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.7andbefore (<) 6.9.10cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-415 Double Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/415/Double-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/be9581ea8c058d81154251cb0695987098996cad", "ref_desc": "mm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migration - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fc7facce686b64201dbf0b9614cc1d0bfad70010", "ref_desc": "mm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migration - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
