{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45304", "Description": "Cairo-Contracts are OpenZeppelin Contracts written in Cairo for Starknet, a decentralized ZK Rollup. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized ownership transfer, contrary to the original owner's intention of leaving the contract without an owner. It introduces a security risk where an unintended party (pending owner) can gain control of the contract after the original owner has renounced ownership. This could also be used by a malicious owner to simulate leaving a contract without an owner, to later regain ownership by previously having proposed himself as a pending owner. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.16.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45304", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContractsVersions  before (<) 0.16.0cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForCairoVersions  before (<) 0.16.0cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:cairo:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-20  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/commit/ef87d7847980e0cf83f4b7f3ff23e6590fb643ec", "ref_desc": "Fix pending owner late overwrite issue (#1122) \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts@ef87d78 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-w2px-25pm-2cf9", "ref_desc": "OwnableTwoStep allows a pending owner to accept ownership after the original owner has renounced ownership \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.16.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.16.0 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
