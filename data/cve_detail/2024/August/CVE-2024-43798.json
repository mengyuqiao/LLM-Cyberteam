{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43798", "Description": "Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. The Chisel server doesn't ever read the documented `AUTH` environment variable used to set credentials, which allows any unauthenticated user to connect, even if credentials were set. Anyone running the Chisel server that is using the `AUTH` environment variable to specify credentials to authenticate against is affected by this vulnerability. Chisel is often used to provide an entrypoint to a private network, which means services that are gated by Chisel may be affected. Additionally, Chisel is often used for exposing services to the internet. An attacker could MITM requests by connecting to a Chisel server and requesting to forward traffic from a remote port. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.10.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43798", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1068 Inconsistency Between Implementation and Documented Design", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1068/Inconsistency-Between-Implementation-and-Documented-Design.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/security/advisories/GHSA-38jh-8h67-m7mj", "ref_desc": "AUTH environment variable not respected in server entrypoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jpillora/chisel \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
