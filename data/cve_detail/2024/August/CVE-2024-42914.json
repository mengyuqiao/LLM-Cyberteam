{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42914", "Description": "A host header injection vulnerability exists in the forgot password functionality of ArrowCMS version 1.0.0. By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users' passwords.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42914", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/trquoccuong/ArrowCMS/", "ref_desc": "GitHub - trquoccuong/ArrowCMS: Arrowjs.io CMS", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/soursec/CVEs/tree/main/CVE-2024-42914", "ref_desc": "CVEs/CVE-2024-42914 at main \u00b7 soursec/CVEs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
