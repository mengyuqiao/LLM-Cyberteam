{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43368", "Description": "The Trix editor, versions prior to 2.1.4, is vulnerable to XSS when pasting malicious code. This vulnerability is a bypass of the fix put in place for GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99. In pull request 1149, sanitation was added for Trix attachments with a `text/html` content type. However, Trix only checks the content type on the paste event's `dataTransfer` object. As long as the `dataTransfer` has a content type of `text/html`, Trix parses its contents and creates an `Attachment` with them, even if the attachment itself doesn't have a `text/html` content type. Trix then uses the attachment content to set the attachment element's `innerHTML`. An attacker could trick a user to copy and paste malicious code that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed. This vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43368", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/security/advisories/GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99", "ref_desc": "XSS Vulnerabilities in Trix Editor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 basecamp/trix \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BKJQ4gdXGdFvOEW0aK0iJcqw8c0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/1156", "ref_desc": "Fix XSS vulnerability on paste by afcapel \u00b7 Pull Request #1156 \u00b7 basecamp/trix \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/security/advisories/GHSA-qm2q-9f3q-2vcv", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability on copy & paste \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 basecamp/trix \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/releases/tag/v2.1.4", "ref_desc": "Release v2.1.4 \u00b7 basecamp/trix \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/commit/7656f578af0d03141a72a9d27cb3692e6947dae6", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #1156 from basecamp/paste-vuln \u00b7 basecamp/trix@7656f57 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/1149", "ref_desc": "Sanitize HTML content in data-trix-* attributes by afcapel \u00b7 Pull Request #1149 \u00b7 basecamp/trix \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xY1Ov8LXxRwhWgPp2lp9kTTGY7g.html"}]}
