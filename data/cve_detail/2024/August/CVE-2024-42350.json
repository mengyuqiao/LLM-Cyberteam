{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42350", "Description": "Biscuit is an authorization token with decentralized verification, offline attenuation and strong security policy enforcement based on a logic language. Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it: 1. the public key of the previous block (used in the signature), 2. the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair. Tokens with third-party blocks containing `trusted` annotations generated through a third party block request. This has been addressed in version 4 of the specification. Users are advised to update their implementations to conform. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42350", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/commit/c87cbb5d778964d6574df3e9e6579567cad12fff", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 biscuit-auth/biscuit@c87cbb5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/security/advisories/GHSA-rgqv-mwc3-c78m", "ref_desc": "Public key confusion in third party block \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 biscuit-auth/biscuit \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
