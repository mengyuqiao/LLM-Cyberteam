{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43399", "Description": "Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. Before 4.0.7, there is a flaw in the Static Libraries analysis section. Specifically, during the extraction of .a extension files, the measure intended to prevent Zip Slip attacks is improperly implemented. Since the implemented measure can be bypassed, the vulnerability allows an attacker to extract files to any desired location within the server running MobSF. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.7.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43399", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpensecurity\u00bbMobile Security FrameworkVersions  before (<) 4.0.7cpe:2.3:a:opensecurity:mobile_security_framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensecurity\u00bbMobile Security FrameworkVersions  before (<) 4.0.7cpe:2.3:a:opensecurity:mobile_security_framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-21  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-4hh3-vj32-gr6j", "ref_desc": "Zip Slip Vulnerability in .a Static Library Files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/cc625fe8430f3437a473e82aa2966d100a4dc883", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY][HOTFIX] Fixes GHSA-4hh3-vj32-gr6j (#2421) \u00b7 MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF@cc625fe \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
