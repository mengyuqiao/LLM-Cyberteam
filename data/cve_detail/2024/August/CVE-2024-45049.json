{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45049", "Description": "Hydra is a Continuous Integration service for Nix based projects. It is possible to trigger evaluations in Hydra without any authentication. Depending on the size of evaluations, this can impact the availability of systems. The problem can be fixed by applying https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/f73043378907c2c7e44f633ad764c8bdd1c947d5 to any Hydra package. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should deny the `/api/push` route in a reverse proxy. This also breaks the \"Evaluate jobset\" button in the frontend.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45049", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/113029832631860419", "ref_desc": "Pierre Bourdon: \"Wait, Hydra just has a documen\u2026\" - Mastodon", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/337766", "ref_desc": "[24.05] hydra_unstable: Fix CVE-2024-45049 by dasJ \u00b7 Pull Request #337766 \u00b7 NixOS/nixpkgs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-xv29-v93r-2f5v", "ref_desc": "Missing authentication when triggering evaluations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NixOS/hydra \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/f73043378907c2c7e44f633ad764c8bdd1c947d5", "ref_desc": "Create eval-jobset role and guard /api/push route \u00b7 NixOS/hydra@f730433 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
