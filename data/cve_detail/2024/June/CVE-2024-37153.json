{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37153", "Description": "Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. There is an issue with how to liquid stake using Safe which itself is a contract. The bug only appears when there is a local state change together with an ICS20 transfer in the same function and uses the contract's balance, that is using the contract address as the sender parameter in an ICS20 transfer using the ICS20 precompile. This is in essence the \"infinite money glitch\" allowing contracts to double the supply of Evmos after each transaction.The issue has been patched in versions >=V18.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37153", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEvmos\u00bbEvmosVersions  before (<) 18.1.0cpe:2.3:a:evmos:evmos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/evmos/evmos/security/advisories/GHSA-xgr7-jgq3-mhmc", "ref_desc": "Contract balance not updating correctly after interchain transaction \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 evmos/evmos \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/evmos/evmos/commit/478b7a62e7af57a70cf3a01126c7f5a89bee69d7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xgr7-jgq3-mhmc \u00b7 evmos/evmos@478b7a6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
