{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34065", "Description": "Strapi is an open-source content management system. By combining two vulnerabilities (an `Open Redirect` and `session token sent as URL query parameter`) in @strapi/plugin-users-permissions before version 4.24.2, is its possible of an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and retrieve the 3rd party tokens. The attack requires user interaction (one click). Unauthenticated attackers can leverage two vulnerabilities to obtain an 3rd party token and the bypass authentication of Strapi apps. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-users-permissions to version 4.24.2 to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34065", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nStrapi\u00bbStrapiVersions  before (<) 4.24.2cpe:2.3:a:strapi:strapi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-27  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/security/advisories/GHSA-wrvh-rcmr-9qfc", "ref_desc": "3rd party token leak and authentication bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 strapi/strapi \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
