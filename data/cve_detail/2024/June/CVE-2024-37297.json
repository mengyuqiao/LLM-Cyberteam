{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37297", "Description": "WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform built on WordPress. A vulnerability introduced in WooCommerce 8.8 allows for cross-site scripting. A bad actor can manipulate a link to include malicious HTML & JavaScript content. While the content is not saved to the database, the links may be sent to victims for malicious purposes. The injected JavaScript could hijack content & data stored in the browser, including the session. The URL content is read through the `Sourcebuster.js` library and then inserted without proper sanitization to the classic checkout and registration forms. Versions 8.8.5 and 8.9.3 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may disable the Order Attribution feature.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37297", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nWoocommerce\u00bbWoocommerce\u00bbForWordpressVersions  from including (>=) 8.9.0andbefore (<) 8.9.3cpe:2.3:a:woocommerce:woocommerce:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions\nWoocommerce\u00bbWoocommerce\u00bbForWordpressVersions  from including (>=) 8.8andbefore (<) 8.8.5cpe:2.3:a:woocommerce:woocommerce:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-24  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/commit/0e9888305d0cb9557e58f558526ab11cb3bcc4b4", "ref_desc": "Sync # 321 with release 8.9 (#48352) \u00b7 woocommerce/woocommerce@0e98883 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/commit/915e32a42762916b745a7e663c8b69a698da8b67", "ref_desc": "Sync # 322 with release 8.8 (#48353) \u00b7 woocommerce/woocommerce@915e32a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/security/advisories/GHSA-cv23-q6gh-xfrf", "ref_desc": "XSS Vulnerability in WooCommerce checkout & registration forms \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 woocommerce/woocommerce \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.woocommerce.com/2024/06/10/developer-advisory-xss-vulnerability-8-8-0", "ref_desc": "Developer Advisory: XSS Vulnerability in WooCommerce 8.8.0 and later Developer Advisories - Woo Developer BlogPress/Media Coverage", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
