{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34703", "Description": "Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit encoding of the parameters. Prior to versions 3.3.0 and 2.19.4, an attacker could present an ECDSA X.509 certificate using explicit encoding where the parameters are very large. The proof of concept used a 16Kbit prime for this purpose. When parsing, the parameter is checked to be prime, causing excessive computation. This was patched in 2.19.4 and 3.3.0 to allow the prime parameter of the elliptic curve to be at most 521 bits. No known workarounds are available. Note that support for explicit encoding of elliptic curve parameters is deprecated in Botan.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34703", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-405 Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/405/Asymmetric-Resource-Consumption-Amplification-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/randombit/botan/commit/08c404b23740babee1f6aa51b54e966029aadee4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #3913 from randombit/jack/limit-ecc-curve-size \u00b7 randombit/botan@08c404b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/randombit/botan/commit/94e9154c143aa5264da6254a6a1be5bc66ee2b5a", "ref_desc": "When decoding an arbitrary elliptic curve, set an upper bound on length \u00b7 randombit/botan@94e9154 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/randombit/botan/security/advisories/GHSA-w4g2-7m2h-7xj7", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service Due to Overly Large Elliptic Curve Parameters \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 randombit/botan \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
