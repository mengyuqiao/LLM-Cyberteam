{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38574", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibbpf: Prevent null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF\n\nIn bpf_objec_load_prog(), there's no guarantee that obj->btf is non-NULL\nwhen passing it to btf__fd(), and this function does not perform any\ncheck before dereferencing its argument (as bpf_object__btf_fd() used to\ndo). As a consequence, we get segmentation fault errors in bpftool (for\nexample) when trying to load programs that come without BTF information.\n\nv2: Keep btf__fd() in the fix instead of reverting to bpf_object__btf_fd().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38574", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9bf48fa19a4b1d186e08b20bf7e5de26a15644fb", "ref_desc": "libbpf: Prevent null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1fd91360a75833b7110af9834ae26c977e1273e0", "ref_desc": "libbpf: Prevent null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ef80b59acfa4dee4b5eaccb15572b69248831104", "ref_desc": "libbpf: Prevent null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
