{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35242", "Description": "Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. On the 2.x branch prior to versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7, the `composer install` command running inside a git/hg repository which has specially crafted branch names can lead to command injection. This requires cloning untrusted repositories. Patches are available in version 2.2.24 for 2.2 LTS or 2.7.7 for mainline. As a workaround, avoid cloning potentially compromised repositories.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35242", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VLPJHM2WWSYU2F6KHW2BYFGYL4IGTKHC/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: composer-2.7.7-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8c1393PjUTb9dOgyKfNxzXKR_vo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-v9qv-c7wm-wgmf", "ref_desc": "Multiple command injections via malicious git/hg branch names \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 composer/composer \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/6bd43dff859c597c09bd03a7e7d6443822d0a396", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-v9qv-c7wm-wgmf \u00b7 composer/composer@6bd43df \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/fc57b93603d7d90b71ca8ec77b1c8a9171fdb467", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-v9qv-c7wm-wgmf \u00b7 composer/composer@fc57b93 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PO4MU2BC7VR6LMHEX4X7DKGHVFXZV2MC/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: composer-2.7.7-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sM_LdKA-1nZ2MAyOj6lJ-f6_5LE.html"}]}
