{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37304", "Description": "NuGet Gallery is a package repository that powers nuget.org. The NuGetGallery has a security vulnerability related to its handling of autolinks in Markdown content. While the platform properly filters out JavaScript from standard links, it does not adequately sanitize autolinks. This oversight allows attackers to exploit autolinks as a vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. When a user inputs a Markdown autolink such as `<javascript:alert(1)>`, the link is rendered without proper sanitization. This means that the JavaScript code within the autolink can be executed by the browser, leading to an XSS attack. Version 2024.05.28 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37304", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/security/advisories/GHSA-gwjh-c548-f787", "ref_desc": "XSS Vulnerability in NuGetGallery's Markdown Autolinks Processing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NuGet/NuGetGallery \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/9836", "ref_desc": "Disable javascript protocol on markdown render by lyndaidaii \u00b7 Pull Request #9836 \u00b7 NuGet/NuGetGallery \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/commit/c52b023659f4ad7b626874c1063f2b5e878a4fe0", "ref_desc": "don't support javascript (#9836) \u00b7 NuGet/NuGetGallery@c52b023 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
