{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37166", "Description": "ghtml is software that uses tagged templates for template engine functionality. It is possible to introduce user-controlled JavaScript code and trigger a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in some cases. Version 2.0.0 introduces changes to mitigate this issue. Version 2.0.0 contains updated documentation to clarify that while ghtml escapes characters with special meaning in HTML, it does not provide comprehensive protection against all types of XSS attacks in every scenario. This aligns with the approach taken by other template engines. Developers should be cautious and take additional measures to sanitize user input and prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the backtick character (`) is now also escaped to prevent the creation of strings in most cases where a malicious actor somehow gains the ability to write JavaScript. This does not provide comprehensive protection either.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37166", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gurgunday/ghtml/security/advisories/GHSA-vvhj-v88f-5gxr", "ref_desc": "XSS is possible due to unhandled attribute value encoding and no control of href values \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gurgunday/ghtml \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gurgunday/ghtml/commit/df1ea50fe8968a766fd2b9379a8f9806375227f8", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vvhj-v88f-5gxr \u00b7 gurgunday/ghtml@df1ea50 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
