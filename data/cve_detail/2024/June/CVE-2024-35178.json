{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35178", "Description": "The Jupyter Server provides the backend for Jupyter web applications. Jupyter Server on Windows has a vulnerability that lets unauthenticated attackers leak the NTLMv2 password hash of the Windows user running the Jupyter server. An attacker can crack this password to gain access to the Windows machine hosting the Jupyter server, or access other network-accessible machines or 3rd party services using that credential. Or an attacker perform an NTLM relay attack without cracking the credential to gain access to other network-accessible machines. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.14.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35178", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbJupyter ServerVersions  before (<) 2.14.1cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyter_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/79fbf801c5908f4d1d9bc90004b74cfaaeeed2df", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hrw6-wg82-cm62 \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server@79fbf80 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-hrw6-wg82-cm62", "ref_desc": "Jupyter server on Windows discloses Windows user password hash \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyter-server/jupyter_server \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
