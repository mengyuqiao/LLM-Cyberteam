{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36400", "Description": "nano-id is a unique string ID generator for Rust. Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified. It should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability. This can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36400", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVIZ\u00bbNano Id\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.4.0cpe:2.3:a:viz:nano_id:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-11  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/331/Insufficient-Entropy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/security/advisories/GHSA-9hc7-6w9r-wj94", "ref_desc": "Unable to generate the correct character set \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 viz-rs/nano-id \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/commit/a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #10 from viz-rs/fix-security \u00b7 viz-rs/nano-id@a902277 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
