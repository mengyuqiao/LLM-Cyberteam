{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38629", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida\n\nfile_ida is allocated during cdev open and is freed accordingly\nduring cdev release. This sequence is guaranteed by driver file\noperations. Therefore, there is no need to destroy an already empty\nfile_ida when the WQ cdev is removed.\n\nWorse, ida_free() in cdev release may happen after destruction of\nfile_ida per WQ cdev. This can lead to accessing an id in file_ida\nafter it has been destroyed, resulting in a kernel panic.\n\nRemove ida_destroy(&file_ida) to address these issues.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38629", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/76e43fa6a456787bad31b8d0daeabda27351a480", "ref_desc": "dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9eb15f24a0b9b017b39cde8b8c07243676b63687", "ref_desc": "dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/15edb906211bf53e7b5574f7326ab734d6bff4f9", "ref_desc": "dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
