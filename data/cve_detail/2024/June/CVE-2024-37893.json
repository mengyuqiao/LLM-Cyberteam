{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37893", "Description": "Firefly III is a free and open source personal finance manager. In affected versions an MFA bypass in the Firefly III OAuth flow may allow malicious users to bypass the MFA-check. This allows malicious users to use password spraying to gain access to Firefly III data using passwords stolen from other sources. As OAuth applications are easily enumerable using an incrementing id, an attacker could try sign an OAuth application up to a users profile quite easily if they have created one. The attacker would also need to know the victims username and password. This problem has been patched in Firefly III v6.1.17 and up. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should Use a unique password for their Firefly III instance and store their password securely, i.e. in a password manager.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37893", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/288/Authentication-Bypass-Using-an-Alternate-Path-or-Channel.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/security/advisories/GHSA-4gm4-c4mh-4p7w", "ref_desc": "MFA bypass in oauth flow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 firefly-iii/firefly-iii \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.menlosecurity.com/what-is/highly-evasive-adaptive-threats-heat/mfa-bypass", "ref_desc": "MFA Bypass | Menlo Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Password_Spraying_Attack", "ref_desc": "Password Spraying Attack | OWASP Foundation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
