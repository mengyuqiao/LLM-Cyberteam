{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-35241", "Description": "Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. On the 2.x branch prior to versions 2.2.24 and 2.7.7, the `status`, `reinstall` and `remove` commands with packages installed from source via git containing specially crafted branch names in the repository can be used to execute code. Patches for this issue are available in version 2.2.24 for 2.2 LTS or 2.7.7 for mainline. As a workaround, avoid installing dependencies via git by using `--prefer-dist` or the `preferred-install: dist` config setting.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35241", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VLPJHM2WWSYU2F6KHW2BYFGYL4IGTKHC/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: composer-2.7.7-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8c1393PjUTb9dOgyKfNxzXKR_vo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-47f6-5gq3-vx9c", "ref_desc": "Command injection via malicious git branch name \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 composer/composer \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/ee28354ca8d33c15949ad7de2ce6656ba3f68704", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-47f6-5gq3-vx9c \u00b7 composer/composer@ee28354 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/b93fc6ca437da35ae73d667d0618749c763b67d4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-47f6-5gq3-vx9c \u00b7 composer/composer@b93fc6c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PO4MU2BC7VR6LMHEX4X7DKGHVFXZV2MC/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: composer-2.7.7-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sM_LdKA-1nZ2MAyOj6lJ-f6_5LE.html"}]}
