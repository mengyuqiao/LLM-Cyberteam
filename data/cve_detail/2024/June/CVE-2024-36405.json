{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36405", "Description": "liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms. A control-flow timing lean has been identified in the reference implementation of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism when it is compiled with Clang 15-18 for `-Os`, `-O1`, and other compilation options. A proof-of-concept local attack on the reference implementation leaks the entire ML-KEM 512 secret key in ~10 minutes using end-to-end decapsulation timing measurements. The issue has been fixed in version 0.10.1. As a possible workaround, some compiler options may produce vectorized code that does not leak secret information, however relying on these compiler options as a workaround may not be reliable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36405", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-385 Covert Timing Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/385/Covert-Timing-Channel.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/7eecda6095c003ddded7175a1ffdf35a2ce63ed5/src/kem/kyber/pqcrystals-kyber_kyber512_ref/poly.c#L166", "ref_desc": "liboqs/src/kem/kyber/pqcrystals-kyber_kyber512_ref/poly.c at 7eecda6095c003ddded7175a1ffdf35a2ce63ed5 \u00b7 open-quantum-safe/liboqs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/commit/9b8d30698a3e7449aeb34e62339d4176f11e3c6c", "ref_desc": "Fixed secret-dependent branch in poly_frommsg introduced by recent ve\u2026 \u00b7 pq-crystals/kyber@9b8d306 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/idEXrK1GWUYRPy65dgPU8c-Hy58.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-f2v9-5498-2vpp", "ref_desc": "Control-flow timing leak in Kyber reference implementation when compiled with Clang 15-18 for -Os, -O1 and other options \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-quantum-safe/liboqs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/982c762c242ef549c914891b47bf6e0ed6321f91", "ref_desc": "Pull Kyber/ML-KEM CT-Fix from upstream \u00b7 open-quantum-safe/liboqs@982c762 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
