{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38580", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nepoll: be better about file lifetimes\n\nepoll can call out to vfs_poll() with a file pointer that may race with\nthe last 'fput()'. That would make f_count go down to zero, and while\nthe ep->mtx locking means that the resulting file pointer tear-down will\nbe blocked until the poll returns, it means that f_count is already\ndead, and any use of it won't actually get a reference to the file any\nmore: it's dead regardless.\n\nMake sure we have a valid ref on the file pointer before we call down to\nvfs_poll() from the epoll routines.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38580", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16e3182f6322575eb7c12e728ad3c7986a189d5d", "ref_desc": "epoll: be better about file lifetimes - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4f65f4defe4e23659275ce5153541cd4f76ce2d2", "ref_desc": "epoll: be better about file lifetimes - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4efaa5acf0a1d2b5947f98abb3acf8bfd966422b", "ref_desc": "epoll: be better about file lifetimes - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/559214eb4e5c3d05e69428af2fae2691ba1eb784", "ref_desc": "epoll: be better about file lifetimes - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cbfd1088e24ec4c1199756a37cb8e4cd0a4b016e", "ref_desc": "epoll: be better about file lifetimes - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
