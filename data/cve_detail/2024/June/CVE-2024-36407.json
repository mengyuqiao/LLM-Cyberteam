{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-36407", "Description": "SuiteCRM is an open-source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. In versions prior to 7.14.4 and 8.6.1, a user password can be reset from an unauthenticated attacker. The attacker does not get access to the new password. But this can be annoying for the user. This attack is also dependent on some password reset functionalities being enabled. It also requires the system using php 7, which is not an officially supported version. Versions 7.14.4 and 8.6.1 contain a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36407", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSalesagility\u00bbSuitecrmVersions  before (<) 7.14.4cpe:2.3:a:salesagility:suitecrm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSalesagility\u00bbSuitecrmVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.6.1cpe:2.3:a:salesagility:suitecrm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/security/advisories/GHSA-6p2f-wwx9-952r", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated User password reset on php7 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 salesagility/SuiteCRM \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
