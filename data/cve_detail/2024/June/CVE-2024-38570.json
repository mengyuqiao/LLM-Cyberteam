{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38570", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: Fix potential glock use-after-free on unmount\n\nWhen a DLM lockspace is released and there ares still locks in that\nlockspace, DLM will unlock those locks automatically.  Commit\nfb6791d100d1b started exploiting this behavior to speed up filesystem\nunmount: gfs2 would simply free glocks it didn't want to unlock and then\nrelease the lockspace.  This didn't take the bast callbacks for\nasynchronous lock contention notifications into account, which remain\nactive until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace is released.\n\nTo prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects, put the\nglocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list, release\nthe lockspace, and only then free those glocks.\n\nAs an additional measure, ignore unexpected ast and bast callbacks if\nthe receiving glock is dead.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38570", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.7andbefore (<) 6.8.12cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 3.8andbefore (<) 6.6.33cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.9andbefore (<) 6.9.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-02  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e42e8a24d7f02d28763d16ca7ec5fc6d1f142af0", "ref_desc": "gfs2: Fix potential glock use-after-free on unmount - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d98779e687726d8f8860f1c54b5687eec5f63a73", "ref_desc": "gfs2: Fix potential glock use-after-free on unmount - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/501cd8fabf621d10bd4893e37f6ce6c20523c8ca", "ref_desc": "gfs2: Fix potential glock use-after-free on unmount - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0636b34b44589b142700ac137b5f69802cfe2e37", "ref_desc": "gfs2: Fix potential glock use-after-free on unmount - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
