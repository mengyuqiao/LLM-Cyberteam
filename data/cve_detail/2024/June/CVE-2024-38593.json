{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38593", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: micrel: Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841\n\nThe blamed commit started to use the ptp workqueue to get the second\npart of the timestamp. And when the port was set down, then this\nworkqueue is stopped. But if the config option NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING\nis not enabled, then the ptp_clock is not initialized so then it would\ncrash when it would try to access the delayed work.\nSo then basically by setting up and then down the port, it would crash.\nThe fix consists in checking if the ptp_clock is initialized and only\nthen cancel the delayed work.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38593", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3fd4282d5f25c3c97fef3ef0b89b82ef4e2bc975", "ref_desc": "net: micrel: Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841 - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3ddf170e4a604f5d4d9459a36993f5e92b53e8b0", "ref_desc": "net: micrel: Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841 - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aea27a92a41dae14843f92c79e9e42d8f570105c", "ref_desc": "net: micrel: Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841 - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/64a47cf634ae44e92be24ebc982410841093bd7b", "ref_desc": "net: micrel: Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841 - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
