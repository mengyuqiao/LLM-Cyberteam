{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38611", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: i2c: et8ek8: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin\n\nUsing __exit for the remove function results in the remove callback\nbeing discarded with CONFIG_VIDEO_ET8EK8=y. When such a device gets\nunbound (e.g. using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removed\nwithout the cleanup being performed. This results in resource leaks. Fix\nit by compiling in the remove callback unconditionally.\n\nThis also fixes a W=1 modpost warning:\n\n\tWARNING: modpost: drivers/media/i2c/et8ek8/et8ek8: section mismatch in reference: et8ek8_i2c_driver+0x10 (section: .data) -> et8ek8_remove (section: .exit.text)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38611", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/545b215736c5c4b354e182d99c578a472ac9bfce", "ref_desc": "media: i2c: et8ek8: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1a3803e5bb91c13e9ad582003e4288f67f06cd9", "ref_desc": "media: i2c: et8ek8: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/43fff07e4b1956d0e5cf23717507e438278ea3d9", "ref_desc": "media: i2c: et8ek8: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/904db2ba44ae60641b6378c5013254d09acf5e80", "ref_desc": "media: i2c: et8ek8: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
