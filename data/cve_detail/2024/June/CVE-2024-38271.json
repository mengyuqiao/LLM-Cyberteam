{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38271", "Description": "There exists a vulnerability in Quick Share/Nearby, where an attacker can force a victim to stay connected to a temporary hotspot created for the sharing. As part of the sequence of packets in a Quick Share connection over Bluetooth, the attacker forces the victim to connect to the attacker\u2019s WiFi network and then sends an OfflineFrame that crashes Quick Share.\nThis makes the Wifi connection to the attacker\u2019s network last, instead of returning to the old network when the Quick Share session completes, allowing the attacker to be a MiTM. We recommend upgrading to version\u00a01.0.1724.0 of Quick Share or above", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38271", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbNearbyVersions  before (<) 1.0.1724.0cpe:2.3:a:google:nearby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/nearby/pull/2433", "ref_desc": "Block any BWU frames before the NC connection accepted by both side by copybara-service[bot] \u00b7 Pull Request #2433 \u00b7 google/nearby \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/nearby/pull/2435", "ref_desc": "Don't upgrade bandwidth until the user accepts. by copybara-service[bot] \u00b7 Pull Request #2435 \u00b7 google/nearby \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/nearby/pull/2589", "ref_desc": "[Sharing] Delete unknown payload with kProgress status by copybara-service[bot] \u00b7 Pull Request #2589 \u00b7 google/nearby \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;PatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gJlfEo7MnIOi8Au0zdsQdWkFROg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/nearby/pull/2402", "ref_desc": "Remove unknown files from PAYLOAD_TRANSFER offline frame by copybara-service[bot] \u00b7 Pull Request #2402 \u00b7 google/nearby \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;PatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/X2qHaMu539uIs8F-y4C8zZjhnP8.html"}]}
