{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37305", "Description": "oqs-provider is a provider for the OpenSSL 3 cryptography library that adds support for post-quantum cryptography in TLS, X.509, and S/MIME using post-quantum algorithms from liboqs. Flaws have been identified in the way oqs-provider handles lengths decoded with DECODE_UINT32 at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are later used for memory reads and writes; malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage. Handling of plain/non-hybrid PQ key operation is not affected. This issue has been patched in in v0.6.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37305", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-130 Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/130/Improper-Handling-of-Length-Parameter-Inconsistency.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-680 Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/680/Integer-Overflow-to-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-805 Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/805/Buffer-Access-with-Incorrect-Length-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/security/advisories/GHSA-pqvr-5cr8-v6fx", "ref_desc": "Buffer overflow in deserialization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/416", "ref_desc": "DECODE_UINT32 without lengths checked fixed by baentsch \u00b7 Pull Request #416 \u00b7 open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
