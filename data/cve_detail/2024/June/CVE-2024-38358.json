{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38358", "Description": "Wasmer is a web assembly (wasm) Runtime supporting WASIX, WASI and Emscripten. If the preopened directory has a symlink pointing outside, WASI programs can traverse the symlink and access host filesystem if the caller sets both `oflags::creat` and `rights::fd_write`. Programs can also crash the runtime by creating a symlink pointing outside with `path_symlink` and `path_open`ing the link. This issue has been addressed in commit `b9483d022` which has been included in release version 4.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38358", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/security/advisories/GHSA-55f3-3qvg-8pv5", "ref_desc": "Symlink bypasses filesystem sandbox \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wasmerio/wasmer \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/commit/b9483d022c602b994103f78ecfe46f017f8ac662", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-55f3-3qvg-8pv5 \u00b7 wasmerio/wasmer@b9483d0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
