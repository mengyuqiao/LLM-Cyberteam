{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-34580", "Description": "Apache XML Security for C++ through 2.0.4 implements the XML Signature Syntax and Processing (XMLDsig) specification without protection against an SSRF payload in a KeyInfo element. NOTE: the project disputes this CVE Record on the grounds that any vulnerabilities are the result of a failure to configure XML Security for C++ securely. Even when avoiding this particular issue, any use of this library would need considerable additional code and a deep understanding of the standards and protocols involved to arrive at a secure implementation for any particular use case. We recommend against continued direct use of this library.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34580", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-14  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2024-07-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zmanion/Vulnerabilities/blob/main/CVE-2024-21893.md", "ref_desc": "Vulnerabilities/CVE-2024-21893.md at main \u00b7 zmanion/Vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3jbLbzqii8rBcRNizv5XjpU1Esg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/3726671873/Santuario", "ref_desc": "Santuario - Development Center - Confluence", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sonatype.com/blog/the-exploited-ivanti-connect-ssrf-vulnerability-stems-from-xmltooling-oss-library", "ref_desc": "Exploited Ivanti Connect SSRF vulnerability traced back to 'xmltooling' OSS library", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/po2gocnw4gtf4boy5mmjb54g62qhbrl9", "ref_desc": "C++ code base officially retried-Apache Mail Archives", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/apache-library-allows-server-side-request-forgery", "ref_desc": "Apache XML Security for C++ Library Allows for Server-Side Request Forgery | Google Cloud Blog", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://santuario.apache.org/download.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Santuario -- download", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
