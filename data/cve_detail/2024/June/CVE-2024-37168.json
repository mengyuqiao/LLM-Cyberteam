{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37168", "Description": "@grpc/grps-js implements the core functionality of gRPC purely in JavaScript, without a C++ addon. Prior to versions 1.10.9, 1.9.15, and 1.8.22, there are two separate code paths in which memory can be allocated per message in excess of the `grpc.max_receive_message_length` channel option: If an incoming message has a size on the wire greater than the configured limit, the entire message is buffered before it is discarded; and/or if an incoming message has a size within the limit on the wire but decompresses to a size greater than the limit, the entire message is decompressed into memory, and on the server is not discarded. This has been patched in versions 1.10.9, 1.9.15, and 1.8.22.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37168", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/789/Memory-Allocation-with-Excessive-Size-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/commit/a8a020339c7eab1347a343a512ad17a4aea4bfdb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7v5v-9h63-cj86 \u00b7 grpc/grpc-node@a8a0203 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/commit/674f4e351a619fd4532f84ae6dff96b8ee4e1ed3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7v5v-9h63-cj86 \u00b7 grpc/grpc-node@674f4e3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/security/advisories/GHSA-7v5v-9h63-cj86", "ref_desc": "@grpc/grpc-js can allocate memory for incoming messages well above configured limits \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grpc/grpc-node \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/commit/08b0422dae56467ecae1007e899efe66a8c4a650", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7v5v-9h63-cj86 \u00b7 grpc/grpc-node@08b0422 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
