{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37300", "Description": "OAuthenticator is software that allows OAuth2 identity providers to be plugged in and used with JupyterHub. JupyterHub < 5.0, when used with `GlobusOAuthenticator`, could be configured to allow all users from a particular institution only. This worked fine prior to JupyterHub 5.0, because `allow_all` did not take precedence over `identity_provider`. Since JupyterHub 5.0, `allow_all` does take precedence over `identity_provider`. On a hub with the same config, now all users will be allowed to login, regardless of `identity_provider`. `identity_provider` will basically be ignored. This is a documented change in JupyterHub 5.0, but is likely to catch many users by surprise. OAuthenticator 16.3.1 fixes the issue with JupyterHub 5.0, and does not affect previous versions. As a workaround, do not upgrade to JupyterHub 5.0 when using `GlobusOAuthenticator` in the prior configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37300", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/commit/d1aea05fa89f2beae15ab0fa0b0d071030f79654", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-gprj-3p75-f996 \u00b7 jupyterhub/oauthenticator@d1aea05 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howto/upgrading-v5.html#authenticator-allow-all-and-allow-existing-users", "ref_desc": "Upgrading to JupyterHub 5 \u2014 JupyterHub documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-gprj-3p75-f996", "ref_desc": "Globus `identity_provider` restriction ignored when used with `allow_all` in JupyterHub 5.0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterhub/oauthenticator \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
