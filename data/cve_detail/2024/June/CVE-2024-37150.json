{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37150", "Description": "An issue in `.npmrc` support in Deno 1.44.0 was discovered where Deno would send `.npmrc` credentials for the scope to the tarball URL when the registry provided URLs for a tarball on a different domain. All users relying on .npmrc are potentially affected by this vulnerability if their private registry references tarball URLs at a different domain. This includes usage of deno install subcommand, auto-install for npm: specifiers and LSP usage. It is recommended to upgrade to Deno 1.44.1 and if your private registry ever serves tarballs at a different domain to rotate your registry credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37150", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDeno\u00bbDeno\u00bbVersion:1.44.0cpe:2.3:a:deno:deno:1.44.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-27  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/706/Use-of-Incorrectly-Resolved-Name-or-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/566adb7c0a0c0845e90a6e867a2c0ef5d2ada575", "ref_desc": "fix(npm): use configured auth for tarball urls instead of scope auth \u2026 \u00b7 denoland/deno@566adb7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-rfc6-h225-3vxv", "ref_desc": "Private npm registry support used scope auth token for downloading tarballs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/npm/cli/wiki/%22No-auth-for-URI,-but-auth-present-for-scoped-registry%22", "ref_desc": "\"No auth for URI, but auth present for scoped registry\" \u00b7 npm/cli Wiki \u00b7 GitHubNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
