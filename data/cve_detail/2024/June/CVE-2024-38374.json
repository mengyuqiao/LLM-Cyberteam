{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38374", "Description": "The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Before deserializing CycloneDX Bill of Materials in XML format, _cyclonedx-core-java_ leverages XPath expressions to determine the schema version of the BOM. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` used to evaluate XPath expressions was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 9.0.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38374", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/security/advisories/GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8", "ref_desc": "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-core-java \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/pull/434/commits/ab0bc9c530d24f737970dbd0287d1190b129853d", "ref_desc": "Fix possible XXE during XML schema version detection by mr-zepol \u00b7 Pull Request #434 \u00b7 CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/pull/434", "ref_desc": "Fix possible XXE during XML schema version detection by mr-zepol \u00b7 Pull Request #434 \u00b7 CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
