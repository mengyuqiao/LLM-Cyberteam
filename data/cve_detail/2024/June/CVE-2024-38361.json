{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38361", "Description": "Spicedb is an Open Source, Google Zanzibar-inspired permissions database to enable fine-grained authorization for customer applications. Use of an exclusion under an arrow that has multiple resources may resolve to `NO_PERMISSION` when permission is expected. If the resource exists under *multiple* folders and the user has access to view more than a single folder, SpiceDB may report the user does not have access due to a failure in the exclusion dispatcher to request that *all* the folders in which the user is a member be returned. Permission is returned as `NO_PERMISSION` when `PERMISSION` is expected on the `CheckPermission` API. This issue has been addressed in version 1.33.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38361", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-grjv-gjgr-66g2", "ref_desc": "Exclusions under arrows with multiple resources can result in no permission returned when permission expected \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/ecef31d2b266fde17eb2c3415e2ec4ceff96fbeb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-grjv-gjgr-66g2 \u00b7 authzed/spicedb@ecef31d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
