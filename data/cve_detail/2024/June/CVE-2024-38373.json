{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38373", "Description": "FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP is a lightweight TCP/IP stack for FreeRTOS. FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP versions 4.0.0 through 4.1.0 contain a buffer over-read issue in the DNS Response Parser when parsing domain names in a DNS response. A carefully crafted DNS response with domain name length value greater than the actual domain name length, could cause the parser to read beyond the DNS response buffer. This issue affects applications using DNS functionality of the FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP stack. Applications that do not use DNS functionality are not affected, even when the DNS functionality is enabled. This vulnerability has been patched in version 4.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38373", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbFreertos-plus-tcpVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.1.1cpe:2.3:o:amazon:freertos-plus-tcp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbFreertos-plus-tcpVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.1.1cpe:2.3:a:amazon:freertos-plus-tcp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-126 Buffer Over-read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/126/Buffer-Over-read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP/security/advisories/GHSA-ppcp-rg65-58mv", "ref_desc": "Buffer Over-Read (CWE-126) in DNS Response Parser \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP/releases/tag/V4.1.1", "ref_desc": "Release V4.1.1 \u00b7 FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
