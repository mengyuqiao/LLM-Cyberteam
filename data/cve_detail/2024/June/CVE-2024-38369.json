{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38369", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. The content of a document included using `{{include reference=\"targetdocument\"/}}` is executed with the right of the includer and not with the right of its author. This means that any user able to modify the target document can impersonate the author of the content which used the `include` macro. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0 RC1 by making the default behavior safe.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38369", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 1.5andbefore (<) 15.0cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-qcj3-wpgm-qpxh", "ref_desc": "Programming rights may be inherited by inclusion which may leads to security issues \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
