{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37162", "Description": "zsa is a library for building typesafe server actions in Next.js. All users are impacted. The zsa application transfers the parse error stack from the server to the client in production build mode. This can potentially reveal sensitive information about the server environment, such as the machine username and directory paths. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive server information. This information could be used to plan further attacks or gain a deeper understanding of the server infrastructure. This has been patched on `0.3.3`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37162", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nIdopesok\u00bbZSAVersions  before (<) 0.3.3cpe:2.3:a:idopesok:zsa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/IdoPesok/zsa/security/advisories/GHSA-wjmj-h3xc-hxp8", "ref_desc": "Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information in zsa \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 IdoPesok/zsa \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IdoPesok/zsa/commit/86b86b282bde6780963f62406cc8bc65f2c86f3a", "ref_desc": "remove stack from errors \u00b7 IdoPesok/zsa@86b86b2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
