{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-37818", "Description": "Strapi v4.24.4 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the component /strapi.io/_next/image. This vulnerability allows attackers to scan for open ports or access sensitive information via a crafted GET request. NOTE: The Strapi Development Community argues that this issue is not valid. They contend that \"the strapi/admin was wrongly attributed a flaw that only pertains to the strapi.io website, and which, at the end of the day, does not pose any real SSRF risk to applications that make use of the Strapi library.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37818", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/%40barkadevaibhav491/server-side-request-forgery-in-strapi-e02d5fe218ab", "ref_desc": "Server-side request forgery in STRAPI v4.24.4 (CVE-2024\u201337818) | by Vaibhav Barkade | Jun, 2024 | Medium", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://strapi.io/", "ref_desc": "Strapi - Open source Node.js Headless CMS \ud83d\ude80CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sM8k2233jbIF_mNyjhf6uHWB9BA.html"}]}
