{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38614", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nopenrisc: traps: Don't send signals to kernel mode threads\n\nOpenRISC exception handling sends signals to user processes on floating\npoint exceptions and trap instructions (for debugging) among others.\nThere is a bug where the trap handling logic may send signals to kernel\nthreads, we should not send these signals to kernel threads, if that\nhappens we treat it as an error.\n\nThis patch adds conditions to die if the kernel receives these\nexceptions in kernel mode code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38614", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c0ed9a711e3392d73e857faa031d8d349c0d70db", "ref_desc": "openrisc: traps: Don't send signals to kernel mode threads - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cea9d0015c140af39477dd5eeb9b20233a45daa9", "ref_desc": "openrisc: traps: Don't send signals to kernel mode threads - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/075c0405b0d7d9fc490609e988a3af0069596538", "ref_desc": "openrisc: traps: Don't send signals to kernel mode threads - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c88cfb5cea5f8f9868ef02cc9ce9183a26dcf20f", "ref_desc": "openrisc: traps: Don't send signals to kernel mode threads - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
