{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32481", "Description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32481", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-681 Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/681/Incorrect-Conversion-between-Numeric-Types.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/9136169468f317a53b4e7448389aa315f90b95ba/vyper/codegen/stmt.py#L286-L287", "ref_desc": "vyper/vyper/codegen/stmt.py at 9136169468f317a53b4e7448389aa315f90b95ba \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/3de1415ee77a9244eb04bdb695e249d3ec9ed868", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@3de1415 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/op0dN1jBdDllOhPPXnpfFbH1YrU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-ppx5-q359-pvwj", "ref_desc": "range(start, start + N) reverts for negative numbers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/5319cfbe14951e007ccdb323257e5ada869b35d5", "ref_desc": "feat: allow `range(x, y, bound=N)` (#3679) \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@5319cfb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
