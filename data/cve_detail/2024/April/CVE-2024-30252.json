{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-30252", "Description": "Livemarks is a browser extension that provides RSS feed bookmark folders. Versions of Livemarks prior to 3.7 are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. A malicious website may be able to coerce the extension to send an authenticated GET request to an arbitrary URL. An authenticated request is a request where the cookies of the browser are sent along with the request. The `subscribe.js` script uses the first parameter from the current URL location as the URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to and checks that the RSS feed is valid XML. `subscribe.js` is accessible by an attacker website due to its use in `subscribe.html`, an HTML page that is declared as a `web_accessible_resource` in `manifest.json`. This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation`. A CSRF breaks the integrity of servers running on a private network. A user of the browser extension may have a private server with dangerous functionality, which is assumed to be safe due to network segmentation. Upon receiving an authenticated request instantiated from an attacker, this integrity is broken. Version 3.7 fixes this issue by removing subscribe.html from `web_accessible_resources`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30252", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/blob/9c5233c82aa2f7c8bac348a08ff52881b00c4f95/shared/feed-parser.js#L5", "ref_desc": "livemarks/shared/feed-parser.js at 9c5233c82aa2f7c8bac348a08ff52881b00c4f95 \u00b7 nt1m/livemarks \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/blob/9c5233c82aa2f7c8bac348a08ff52881b00c4f95/manifest.json#L4", "ref_desc": "livemarks/manifest.json at 9c5233c82aa2f7c8bac348a08ff52881b00c4f95 \u00b7 nt1m/livemarks \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/blob/9c5233c82aa2f7c8bac348a08ff52881b00c4f95/pages/subscribe/subscribe.js#L52", "ref_desc": "livemarks/pages/subscribe/subscribe.js at 9c5233c82aa2f7c8bac348a08ff52881b00c4f95 \u00b7 nt1m/livemarks \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/commit/1bcf39f6e91f7352301013f8feac6d488719450f", "ref_desc": "Remove unnecessary web_accessible_resources \u00b7 nt1m/livemarks@1bcf39f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/security/advisories/GHSA-3gg9-w4fm-jjcg", "ref_desc": "GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report, livemarks: `GHSL-2024-015` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nt1m/livemarks \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
