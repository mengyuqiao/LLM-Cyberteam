{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31457", "Description": "gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin, which separates the front and rear of the full stack. gin-vue-admin pseudoversion 0.0.0-20240407133540-7bc7c3051067, corresponding to version 2.6.1, has a code injection vulnerability in the backend. In the Plugin System -> Plugin Template feature, an attacker can perform directory traversal by manipulating the `plugName` parameter. They can create specific folders such as `api`, `config`, `global`, `model`, `router`, `service`, and `main.go` function within the specified traversal directory. Moreover, the Go files within these folders can have arbitrary code inserted based on a specific PoC parameter. The main reason for the existence of this vulnerability is the controllability of the PlugName field within the struct. Pseudoversion 0.0.0-20240409100909-b1b7427c6ea6, corresponding to commit b1b7427c6ea6c7a027fa188c6be557f3795e732b, contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may manually use a filtering method available in the GitHub Security Advisory to rectify the directory traversal problem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31457", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/commit/b1b7427c6ea6c7a027fa188c6be557f3795e732b", "ref_desc": "fixed:\u4fee\u590dGHSA-gv3w-m57p-3wc4 \u00b7 flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin@b1b7427 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/server?tab=versions", "ref_desc": "server command versions - github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/server - Go Packages", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/security/advisories/GHSA-gv3w-m57p-3wc4", "ref_desc": "\u540e\u53f0\u4efb\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u6f0f\u6d1e \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
