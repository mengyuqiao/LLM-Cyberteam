{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-30380", "Description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS), which causes the l2cpd process to crash by sending a specific TLV.\n\nThe l2cpd process is responsible for layer 2 control protocols, such as STP, RSTP, MSTP, VSTP, ERP, and LLDP.\u00a0 The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP, leading to a Denial of Service.\u00a0\u00a0Continued receipt and processing of this specific TLV will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \nall versions before 20.4R3-S9, \nfrom 21.2 before 21.2R3-S7, \nfrom 21.3 before 21.3R3-S5, \nfrom 21.4 before 21.4R3-S4, \nfrom 22.1 before 22.1R3-S4, \nfrom 22.2 before 22.2R3-S2, \nfrom 22.3 before 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3-S1, \nfrom 22.4 before 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3, \nfrom 23.2 before 23.2R1-S1, 23.2R2;\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \nall versions before 21.2R3-S7,\n\n \nfrom 21.3 before 21.3R3-S5-EVO, \nfrom 21.4 before 21.4R3-S5-EVO, \nfrom 22.1 before 22.1R3-S4-EVO, \nfrom 22.2 before 22.2R3-S2-EVO, \nfrom 22.3 before 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S1-EVO, \nfrom 22.4 before 22.4R2-S2-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO, \nfrom 23.2 before 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30380", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L", "ref_desc": "Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 4.0 CalculatorCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nTc1HpEmQsS_wsUzkhxeKMvBc48.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA79171", "ref_desc": "Article Detail", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
