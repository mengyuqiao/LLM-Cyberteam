{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31082", "Description": "A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31082", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-126 Buffer Over-read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/126/Buffer-Over-read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2271999", "ref_desc": "2271999 \u2013 (CVE-2024-31082) CVE-2024-31082 xorg-x11-server: Heap buffer overread/data leakage in ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-31082", "ref_desc": "cve-details", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/10", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: Fwd: X.Org Security Advisory: Issues in X.Org X server prior to 21.1.12 and Xwayland prior to 23.2.5CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Ehin6fpxbr3Egz2rPrq-mzYI8RU.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/13", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Fwd: X.Org Security Advisory: Issues in X.Org X server prior to 21.1.12 and Xwayland prior to 23.2.5CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/j0Mjl6CJUyRzTvAzDCP-VvpIVkg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2024-April/003497.html", "ref_desc": "X.Org Security Advisory: Issues in X.Org X server prior to 21.1.12 and Xwayland prior to 23.2.5", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
