{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32473", "Description": "Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. In 26.0.0, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces, including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access, (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses, (2) if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses, and (3) the interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or, in the service configuration of a `compose` file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32473", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-x84c-p2g9-rqv9", "ref_desc": "IPv6 enabled on IPv4-only network interfaces \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 moby/moby \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/7cef0d9cd1cf221d8c0b7b7aeda69552649e0642", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-x84c-p2g9-rqv9 \u00b7 moby/moby@7cef0d9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
