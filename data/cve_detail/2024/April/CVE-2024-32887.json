The value of substr parameter is reflected in the response without any encoding, allowing an attacker to inject Javascript code into the response of the application.

Moreover, if other applications are deployed on the same domain or website as Sidekiq, users of those applications could also be affected, leading to a broader scope of compromise. Potentially compromising their accounts, forcing the users to perform sensitive actions, stealing sensitive data, performing CORS attacks, defacement of the web application, etc. This issue has been patched in version 7.2.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32887", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/commit/30786e082c70349ab27ffa9eccc42fb0c696164d", "ref_desc": "Fix for CVE-2024-32887 \u00b7 sidekiq/sidekiq@30786e0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/security/advisories/GHSA-q655-3pj8-9fxq", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS in Metrics Web Page \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sidekiq/sidekiq \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/releases/tag/v7.2.4", "ref_desc": "Release v7.2.4 \u00b7 sidekiq/sidekiq \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
