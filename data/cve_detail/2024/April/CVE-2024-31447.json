{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31447", "Description": "Shopware 6 is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue. Starting in version 6.3.5.0 and prior to versions 6.6.1.0 and 6.5.8.8, when a authenticated request is made to `POST /store-api/account/logout`, the cart will be cleared, but the User won't be logged out. This affects only the direct store-api usage, as the PHP Storefront listens additionally on `CustomerLogoutEvent` and invalidates the session additionally. The problem has been fixed in Shopware 6.6.1.0 and 6.5.8.8. Those who are unable to update can install the latest version of the Shopware Security Plugin as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31447", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-5297-wrrp-rcj7", "ref_desc": "Improper Session Handling in store-api account logout \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/shopware \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/d29775aa758f70d08e0c5999795c7c26d230e7d3", "ref_desc": "NEXT-34608 - Improve account logout \u00b7 shopware/shopware@d29775a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/5cc84ddd817ad0c1d07f9b3c79ab346d50514a77", "ref_desc": "NEXT-34608 - Improve account logout \u00b7 shopware/shopware@5cc84dd \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
