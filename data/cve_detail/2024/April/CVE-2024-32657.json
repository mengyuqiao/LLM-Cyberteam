{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32657", "Description": "Hydra is a Continuous Integration service for Nix based projects. Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the browser context of Hydra and execute authenticated HTTP requests. The abused feature allows Nix builds to specify files that Hydra serves to clients. One use of this functionality is serving NixOS `.iso` files. The issue is only with html files served by Hydra. The issue has been patched on https://hydra.nixos.org around 2024-04-21 14:30 UTC. The nixpkgs package were fixed in unstable and 23.11. Users with custom Hydra packages can apply the fix commit to their local installations. The vulnerability is only triggered when opening HTML build artifacts, so not opening them until the vulnerability is fixed works around the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32657", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/306017", "ref_desc": "hydra_unstable: Fix CVE-2024-32657 by dasJ \u00b7 Pull Request #306017 \u00b7 NixOS/nixpkgs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/b72528be5074f3e62e9ae2c2ae8ef9c07a0b4dd3", "ref_desc": "web: serveFile: also serve a CSP putting served HTML in its own origin \u00b7 NixOS/hydra@b72528b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/306018", "ref_desc": "[23.11] hydra_unstable: Fix CVE-2024-32657 by dasJ \u00b7 Pull Request #306018 \u00b7 NixOS/nixpkgs \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-2p75-6g9f-pqgx", "ref_desc": "Persistent XSS serving HTML build outputs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NixOS/hydra \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
