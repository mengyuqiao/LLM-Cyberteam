{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32866", "Description": "Conform, a type-safe form validation library, allows the parsing of nested objects in the form of `object.property`. Due to an improper implementation of this feature in versions prior to 1.1.1, an attacker can exploit the feature to trigger prototype pollution by passing a crafted input to `parseWith...` functions. Applications that use conform for server-side validation of form data or URL parameters are affected by this vulnerability. Version 1.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32866", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/commit/4819d51b5a53fd5486fc85c17cdc148eb160e3de", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-624g-8qjg-8qxf \u00b7 edmundhung/conform@4819d51 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/blob/59156d7115a7207fa3b6f8a70a4342a9b24c2501/packages/conform-dom/formdata.ts#L117", "ref_desc": "conform/packages/conform-dom/formdata.ts at 59156d7115a7207fa3b6f8a70a4342a9b24c2501 \u00b7 edmundhung/conform \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/security/advisories/GHSA-624g-8qjg-8qxf", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution Vulnerability in `parseWith...` function \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 edmundhung/conform \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
