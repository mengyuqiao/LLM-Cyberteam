{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31212", "Description": "InstantCMS is a free and open source content management system. A SQL injection vulnerability affects instantcms v2.16.2 in which an attacker with administrative privileges can cause the application to execute unauthorized SQL code. The vulnerability exists in index_chart_data action, which receives an input from user and passes it unsanitized to the core model `filterFunc` function that further embeds this data in an SQL statement. This allows attackers to inject unwanted SQL code into the statement. The `period` should be escaped before inserting it in the query. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31212", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection;Input validation", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/instantsoft/icms2/blob/4691a1524780e74107f6009b48d91e17a81b0fa1/system/core/model.php#L744", "ref_desc": "icms2/system/core/model.php at 4691a1524780e74107f6009b48d91e17a81b0fa1 \u00b7 instantsoft/icms2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/instantsoft/icms2/blob/4691a1524780e74107f6009b48d91e17a81b0fa1/system/controllers/admin/actions/index_chart_data.php#L190", "ref_desc": "icms2/system/controllers/admin/actions/index_chart_data.php at 4691a1524780e74107f6009b48d91e17a81b0fa1 \u00b7 instantsoft/icms2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109034767/300806111-a33d9548-d99f-4034-bef3-fbd7fa62c37f.png", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/instantsoft/icms2/security/advisories/GHSA-qx95-w566-73fw", "ref_desc": "SQL injection in index_chart_data action \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 instantsoft/icms2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
