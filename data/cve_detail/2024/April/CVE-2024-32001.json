{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32001", "Description": "SpiceDB is a graph database purpose-built for storing and evaluating access control data. Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder->view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for either `folder` or `folder#parent`. This bug only manifests if the same subject type is used multiple types in a relation, relationships exist for both subject types and an arrow is used over the relation. Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupSubjects request with version before v1.30.1 is affected. Version 1.30.1 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, avoid using LookupSubjects for negative authorization decisions and/or avoid using the broken schema.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32001", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.30.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.30.1 \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/a244ed1edfaf2382711dccdb699971ec97190c7b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-j85q-46hg-36p2 \u00b7 authzed/spicedb@a244ed1 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-j85q-46hg-36p2", "ref_desc": "LookupSubjects may return partial results if a specific kind of relation is used \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
