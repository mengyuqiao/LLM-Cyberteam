{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32648", "Description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Prior to version 0.3.0, default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys and the lock isn't emitted. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, using a lock on a `default` function is a very sparsely used pattern. As such, the impact is low. Version 0.3.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32648", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-667 Improper Locking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/667/Improper-Locking.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2455", "ref_desc": "default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys \u00b7 Issue #2455 \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-m2v9-w374-5hj9", "ref_desc": "default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/93287e5ac184b53b395c907d40701f721daf8177", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2447 from charles-cooper/abi_refactor \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@93287e5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
