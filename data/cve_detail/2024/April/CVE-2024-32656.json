{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32656", "Description": "Ant Media Server is live streaming engine software. A local privilege escalation vulnerability in present in versions 2.6.0 through 2.8.2 allows any unprivileged operating system user account to escalate privileges to the root user account on the system. This vulnerability arises from Ant Media Server running with Java Management Extensions (JMX) enabled and authentication disabled on localhost on port 5599/TCP. This vulnerability is nearly identical to the local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-26269 identified in Apache James. Any unprivileged operating system user can connect to the JMX service running on port 5599/TCP on localhost and leverage the MLet Bean within JMX to load a remote MBean from an attacker-controlled server. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Java process run by Ant Media Server and execute code within the context of the `antmedia` service account on the system. Version 2.9.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may remove certain parameters from the `antmedia.service` file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32656", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/commit/9cb38500729e0ff302da0290b9cfe1ec4dd6c764", "ref_desc": "Disable jmx remote by default \u00b7 ant-media/Ant-Media-Server@9cb3850 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-qwhw-hh9j-54f5", "ref_desc": "Local privilege escalation which allows any unprivileged operating system user account to escalate privileges to the root user account on the system \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ant-media/Ant-Media-Server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
