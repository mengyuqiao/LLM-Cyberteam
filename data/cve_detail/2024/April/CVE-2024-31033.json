{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31033", "Description": "JJWT (aka Java JWT) through 0.12.5 ignores certain characters and thus a user might falsely conclude that they have a strong key. The impacted code is the setSigningKey() method within the DefaultJwtParser class and the signWith() method within the DefaultJwtBuilder class. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the \"ignores\" behavior cannot occur (in any version) unless there is a user error in how JJWT is used, and because the version that was actually tested must have been more than six years out of date.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31033", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.viralpatel.net/java-create-validate-jwt-token/", "ref_desc": "Create and Validate JWT Token in Java using JJWT - ViralPatel.net", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/930#issuecomment-2032699358", "ref_desc": "CVE reported against 1.11.5 \u00b7 Issue #930 \u00b7 jwtk/jjwt \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt", "ref_desc": "GitHub - jwtk/jjwt: Java JWT: JSON Web Token for Java and Android", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/2308652512/JJWT_BUG", "ref_desc": "GitHub - 2308652512/JJWT_BUG: Details of CVE-2024-31033", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
