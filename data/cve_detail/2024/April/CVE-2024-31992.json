{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31992", "Description": "Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server, however these requests are not rate-limited. While there are efforts to prevent DDoS by implementing a timeout on requests, it is possible for an attacker to issue a large number of requests to the server which will be handled in batches based on the configuration of the Mealie server. The chunking of responses is helpful for mitigating memory exhaustion on the Mealie server, however a single request to an arbitrarily large external file (e.g. a Debian ISO) is often sufficient to completely saturate a CPU core assigned to the Mealie container. Without rate limiting in place, it is possible to not only sustain traffic against an external target indefinitely, but also to exhaust the CPU resources assigned to the Mealie container. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31992", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie/commit/2a3463b7466bc297aede50046da9550d919ec56f", "ref_desc": "security: gh security recs (#3368) \u00b7 mealie-recipes/mealie@2a3463b \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-nCIuU9Yu3c9Aww-7UR5Z8X4VQQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie/blob/mealie-next/mealie/services/scraper/scraper_strategies.py#L27-L70", "ref_desc": "mealie/mealie/services/scraper/scraper_strategies.py at mealie-next \u00b7 mealie-recipes/mealie \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EbG2D_PcfOu82Dm-B52QsdZurN8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-225_GHSL-2023-226_Mealie/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-225, GHSL-2023-226, GHSL-2023-227, and GHSL-2023-228: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Denial of Service (DoS) in Mealie - CVE-2024-31991, CVE-2024-31992, CVE-2024-31993, CVE-2024-3199CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mtDJTpXlhNT_YzWNTJq4E3-76Qg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie/pull/3368", "ref_desc": "security: gh security recs by hay-kot \u00b7 Pull Request #3368 \u00b7 mealie-recipes/mealie \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/W_ny9aa1k38YbB3p7vkIPQRUTHI.html"}]}
