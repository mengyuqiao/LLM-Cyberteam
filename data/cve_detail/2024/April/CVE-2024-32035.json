{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32035", "Description": "ImageSharp is a 2D graphics API. A vulnerability discovered in the ImageSharp library, where the processing of specially crafted files can lead to excessive memory usage in image decoders. The vulnerability is triggered when ImageSharp attempts to process image files that are designed to exploit this flaw.  This flaw can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on ImageSharp for image processing tasks. Users and administrators are advised to update to the latest version of ImageSharp that addresses this vulnerability to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The problem has been patched in v3.1.4 and v2.1.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32035", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/789/Memory-Allocation-with-Excessive-Size-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/commit/f21d64188e59ae9464ff462056a5e29d8e618b27", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2715 from SixLabors/backport/v2-memlimit \u00b7 SixLabors/ImageSharp@f21d641 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.sixlabors.com/articles/imagesharp/security.html", "ref_desc": "Security ConsiderationsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GvwPL24Sca5TSGbj6M-8rQQiOJo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/commit/b6b08ac3e7cea8da5ac1e90f7c0b67dd254535c3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2706 from SixLabors/af/memlimit-01 \u00b7 SixLabors/ImageSharp@b6b08ac \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.sixlabors.com/articles/imagesharp.web/processingcommands.html#securing-processing-commands", "ref_desc": "Processing CommandsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/n5luBI7DyAw8lP7tAzL4Tqy9jrc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-g85r-6x2q-45w7", "ref_desc": "Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value in SixLabors.ImageSharp \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 SixLabors/ImageSharp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
