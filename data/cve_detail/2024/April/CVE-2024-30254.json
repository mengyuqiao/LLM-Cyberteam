{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-30254", "Description": "MesonLSP is an unofficial, unendorsed language server for meson written in C++. A vulnerability in versions prior to 4.1.4 allows overwriting arbitrary files if the attacker can make the victim either run the language server within a specific crafted project or `mesonlsp --full`. Version 4.1.4 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid running `mesonlsp --full` and set the language server option `others.neverDownloadAutomatically` to `true`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30254", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/JCWasmx86/mesonlsp/commit/594b6334061371911cd59389124ab8af30ce0a3a", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'fix_vuln' \u00b7 JCWasmx86/mesonlsp@594b633 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JCWasmx86/mesonlsp/security/advisories/GHSA-48c5-35fh-846h", "ref_desc": "Directory traversal allowing overwriting arbitrary files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 JCWasmx86/mesonlsp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
