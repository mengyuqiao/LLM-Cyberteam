{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32652", "Description": "The adapter @hono/node-server allows you to run your Hono application on Node.js. Prior to 1.10.1, the application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that `@hono/node-server` can't handle well. Invalid values are those that cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname such as an empty string, slashes `/`, and other strings. The version 1.10.1 includes the fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32652", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/honojs/node-server/commit/d847e60249fd8183ba0998bc379ba20505643204", "ref_desc": "fix: catch ERR_INVALID_URL error in listener (#162) \u00b7 honojs/node-server@d847e60 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-hgxw-5xg3-69jx", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service risk when receiving Host header that cannot be parsed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 honojs/node-server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/159", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service in newRequest \u00b7 Issue #159 \u00b7 honojs/node-server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
