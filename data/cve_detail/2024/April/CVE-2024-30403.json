{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-30403", "Description": "A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen Layer 2 traffic is sent through a logical interface, MAC learning happens. If during this process, the interface flaps,\u00a0an\u00a0Advanced Forwarding Toolkit manager (evo-aftmand-bt) core is observed. This leads to a PFE restart. The crash reoccurs if the same sequence of events happens, which will lead to a sustained DoS condition.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\u00a023.2-EVO versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30403", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "ref_desc": "Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 4.0 CalculatorCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iX1M8ilXoiu127JD7nGw8d6h400.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L", "ref_desc": "Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 4.0 CalculatorCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nTc1HpEmQsS_wsUzkhxeKMvBc48.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA79181", "ref_desc": "Article Detail", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
