{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32644", "Description": "Evmos is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake EVM blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. Prior to 17.0.0, there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one, we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method, we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and, **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage`, we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore.  If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction, but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change, it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.  The issue has been patched in versions >=V17.0.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32644", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-662 Improper Synchronization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/662/Improper-Synchronization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/evmos/evmos/security/advisories/GHSA-3fp5-2xwh-fxm6", "ref_desc": "Transaction execution not accounting for all state transition after interaction with precompiles \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 evmos/evmos \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/evmos/evmos/commit/08982b5ee726b97bc50eaf58d1914829648b6a5f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-3fp5-2xwh-fxm6 \u00b7 evmos/evmos@08982b5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/b196a522ba4951890b40992e9f97aa610f8b5f9c/x/evm/statedb/statedb.go#L460-L465", "ref_desc": "evmos/x/evm/statedb/statedb.go at b196a522ba4951890b40992e9f97aa610f8b5f9c \u00b7 evmos/evmos \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
