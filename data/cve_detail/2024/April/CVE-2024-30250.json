{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-30250", "Description": "Astro-Shield is an integration to enhance website security with SubResource Integrity hashes, Content-Security-Policy headers, and other techniques. Versions from 1.2.0 to 1.3.1 of Astro-Shield allow bypass to the allow-lists for cross-origin resources by introducing valid `integrity` attributes to the injected code. This implies that the injected SRI hash would be added to the generated CSP header, which would lead the browser to believe that the injected resource is legit. This vulnerability is patched in version 1.3.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30250", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kindspells/astro-shield/security/advisories/GHSA-c4gr-q97g-ppwc", "ref_desc": "Setting a correct `integrity` attribute to injected code allows to bypass the allow-lists \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kindspells/astro-shield \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kindspells/astro-shield/commit/5ae8b8ef4f681d3a81431ee7e79d5dec545c6e1f", "ref_desc": "fix: do not trust integrity attribute when undeserved \u00b7 kindspells/astro-shield@5ae8b8e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kindspells/astro-shield/releases/tag/1.3.2", "ref_desc": "Release 1.3.2 \u00b7 kindspells/astro-shield \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kindspells/astro-shield/commit/1221019306f501bf5fa9bcfb5a23a2321d34ba0a", "ref_desc": "fix: ensure that allowed scripts are in hashes module \u00b7 kindspells/astro-shield@1221019 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
