{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32878", "Description": "Llama.cpp is LLM inference in C/C++. There is a use of uninitialized heap variable vulnerability in gguf_init_from_file, the code will free this uninitialized variable later. In a simple POC, it will directly cause a crash. If the file is carefully constructed, it may be possible to control this uninitialized value and cause arbitrary address free problems. This may further lead to be exploited. Causes llama.cpp to crash (DoS) and may even lead to arbitrary code execution (RCE). This vulnerability has been patched in commit b2740.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32878", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-456 Missing Initialization of a Variable", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/456/Missing-Initialization-of-a-Variable.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/security/advisories/GHSA-p5mv-gjc5-mwqv", "ref_desc": "Use of Uninitialized Variable Vulnerability in gguf_init_from_file \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ggerganov/llama.cpp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b2749", "ref_desc": "Release b2749 \u00b7 ggerganov/llama.cpp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
