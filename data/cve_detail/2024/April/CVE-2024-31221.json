{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31221", "Description": "Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Starting in version 0.10.0 and prior to version 0.23.0, after unpairing all devices in the web UI interface and then pairing only one device, all of the previously devices will be temporarily paired. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, restarting Sunshine after unpairing all devices prevents the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31221", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/issues/2305", "ref_desc": "Pairing only one device after unpair all devices pair all of them again without the need of a PIN \u00b7 Issue #2305 \u00b7 LizardByte/Sunshine \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/commit/b7aa8119f1471844dccdf73a8b6f7efc9baddb5e", "ref_desc": "fix(security): ensure unpairing takes effect without restart (#2365) \u00b7 LizardByte/Sunshine@b7aa811 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/pull/2365", "ref_desc": "fix(security): ensure unpairing takes effect without restart by ReenigneArcher \u00b7 Pull Request #2365 \u00b7 LizardByte/Sunshine \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/security/advisories/GHSA-v8gw-jw28-v55m", "ref_desc": "Clients removed during unpairing process may regain access if Sunshine was not restarted \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LizardByte/Sunshine \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
