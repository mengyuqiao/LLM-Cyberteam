{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31455", "Description": "Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. A refactoring in commit `5c381cf` added the ability to get GitHub repositories registered to a project without specifying a specific provider.  Unfortunately, the SQL query for doing so was missing parenthesis, and would select a random repository. This issue is patched in pull request 2941. As a workaround, revert prior to `5c381cf`, or roll forward past `2eb94e7`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31455", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/security/advisories/GHSA-ggp5-28x4-xcj9", "ref_desc": "GetRepositoryByName data leak \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 stacklok/minder \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/pull/2941", "ref_desc": "Fix repository delete by name by eleftherias \u00b7 Pull Request #2941 \u00b7 stacklok/minder \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/5c381cfbf3e4b7ce040ed8511a1fae1a78a0014b", "ref_desc": "Make provider an optional filter (#2871) \u00b7 stacklok/minder@5c381cf \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/11b6573ad62cfdd783a8bb52f3fce461466037f4", "ref_desc": "Fix repository delete by name (#2941) \u00b7 stacklok/minder@11b6573 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
