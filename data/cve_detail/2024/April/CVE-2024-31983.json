{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31983", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. In multilingual wikis, translations can be edited by any user who has edit right, circumventing the rights that are normally required for authoring translations (script right for user-scope translations, wiki admin for translations on the wiki). Starting in version 4.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 4.10.20, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, this can be exploited for remote code execution if the translation value is not properly escaped where it is used. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.20, 15.5.4 and 15.10RC1. As a workaround, one may restrict edit rights on documents that contain translations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31983", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/c4c8d61c30de72298d805ccc82df2a307f131c54", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21411: Improve check of translation document author rights \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@c4c8d61 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/73aef9648bbff04b697837f1b906932f0d5caacb", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21411: Improve check of translation document author rights \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@73aef96 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21411", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-21411] Privilege escalation (PR) from edit in multilingual wikis via translations - XWiki.org JIRA", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-xxp2-9c9g-7wmj", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution from edit in multilingual wikis via translations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/2a9ce88f33663c53c9c63b2ea573f4720ea2efb9", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21411: Improve check of translation document author rights \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@2a9ce88 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
