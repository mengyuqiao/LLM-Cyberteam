{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32879", "Description": "Python Social Auth is a social authentication/registration mechanism. Prior to version 5.4.1, due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match. This issue has been addressed by a fix released in version 5.4.1. An immediate workaround would be to change collation of the affected field.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32879", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-178 Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/178/Improper-Handling-of-Case-Sensitivity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-303 Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/303/Incorrect-Implementation-of-Authentication-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/pull/566", "ref_desc": "models: make sure uid is compared case-sensitive by nijel \u00b7 Pull Request #566 \u00b7 python-social-auth/social-app-django \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/commit/31c3e0c7edb187004d8abbde7e9c4f7ef9098138", "ref_desc": "models: make sure uid is compared case-sensitive \u00b7 python-social-auth/social-app-django@31c3e0c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/security/advisories/GHSA-2gr8-3wc7-xhj3", "ref_desc": "Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity in social-auth-app-django \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 python-social-auth/social-app-django \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
