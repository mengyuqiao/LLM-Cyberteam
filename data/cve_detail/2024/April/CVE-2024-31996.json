{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31996", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.0.1 and prior to versions 4.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, the HTML escaping of escaping tool that is used in XWiki doesn't escape `{`, which, when used in certain places, allows XWiki syntax injection and thereby remote code execution. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.5, and 15.9 RC1. Apart from upgrading, there is no generic workaround. However, replacing `$escapetool.html` by `$escapetool.xml` in XWiki documents fixes the vulnerability. In a standard XWiki installation, the maintainers are only aware of the document `Panels.PanelLayoutUpdate` that exposes this vulnerability, patching this document is thus a workaround. Any extension could expose this vulnerability and might thus require patching, too.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31996", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-95 Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/95/Improper-Neutralization-of-Directives-in-Dynamically-Evaluat.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2828", "ref_desc": "[XCOMMONS-2828] $escapetool.html doesn't escape {, allowing XWiki syntax injection - XWiki.org JIRA", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/b0805160ec7b01ee12417e79cb384e60ae4817aa", "ref_desc": "XCOMMONS-2828: Support curly braces in `EscapeTool.html()` \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-commons@b080516 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/ed7ff515a2436a1c6dcbd0c6ca0c41e434d58915", "ref_desc": "XCOMMONS-2828: Support curly braces in `EscapeTool.html()` \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-commons@ed7ff51 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/security/advisories/GHSA-hf43-47q4-fhq5", "ref_desc": "Missing escaping of { in Velocity escapetool allows remote code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-commons \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/b94142e2a66ec32e89eacab67c3da8d91f5ef93a", "ref_desc": "XCOMMONS-2828: Support curly braces in `EscapeTool.html()` \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-commons@b94142e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21438", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-21438] Remote code execution from view right on Panels.PanelLayoutUpdate - XWiki.org JIRA", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
