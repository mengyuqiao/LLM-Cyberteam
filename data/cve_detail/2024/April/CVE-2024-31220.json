{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31220", "Description": "Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Starting in version 0.16.0 and prior to version 0.18.0, an attacker may be able to remotely read arbitrary files without authentication due to a path traversal vulnerability. Users who exposed the Sunshine configuration web user interface outside of localhost may be affected, depending on firewall configuration. To exploit vulnerability, attacker could make an http/s request to the `node_modules` endpoint if user exposed Sunshine config web server to internet or attacker is on the LAN. Version 0.18.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may block access to Sunshine via firewall.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31220", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/releases/tag/v0.18.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.18.0 \u00b7 LizardByte/Sunshine \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/security/advisories/GHSA-6rg7-7m3w-w5wc", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary file can be read from remote without authentication \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LizardByte/Sunshine \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
