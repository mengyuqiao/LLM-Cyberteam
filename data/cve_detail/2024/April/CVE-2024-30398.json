{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-30398", "Description": "An Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen a high amount of specific traffic is received on a SRX4600 device, due to an error in internal packet handling, a consistent rise in CPU memory utilization occurs. This results in packet drops in the traffic and eventually the PFE crashes. A manual reboot of the PFE will be required to restore the device to original state.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n  *  21.2 before\u00a021.2R3-S7,\n  *  21.4 before 21.4R3-S6,\u00a0\n  *  22.1 before 22.1R3-S5, \n  *  22.2 before 22.2R3-S3,\n  *  22.3 before 22.3R3-S2,\n  *  22.4 before 22.4R3,\n\n  *  23.2 before\u00a023.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30398", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L", "ref_desc": "Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 4.0 CalculatorCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/d5NQE7fYVy_vnRPba4nAssYinbs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "ref_desc": "Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 4.0 CalculatorCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mxKiEwtf-8Ekur4nO3mgkdE--Jk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA79176", "ref_desc": "Article Detail", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
