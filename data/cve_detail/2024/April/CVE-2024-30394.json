{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-30394", "Description": "A\u00a0Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) component of Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause an rpd crash, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nOn all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when EVPN is configured, and a specific EVPN type-5 route is received via BGP, rpd crashes and restarts. Continuous receipt of this specific route will lead to a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue affects:\nJunos OS:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S7,\n\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S5,\n\n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S4,\n\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S2,\n\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S1,\n\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3,\n\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2.\n\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.4R3-S5-EVO,\n\n  *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S4-EVO,\n\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S2-EVO,\n\n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S1-EVO,\n\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO,\n\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30394", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L", "ref_desc": "Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 4.0 CalculatorCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/d5NQE7fYVy_vnRPba4nAssYinbs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA79094", "ref_desc": "2024-04 Security Bulletin: Junos OS: A specific EVPN type-5 route causes rpd crash (CVE-2024-30394)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "ref_desc": "Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 4.0 CalculatorCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mJMnRU-918tpBbLW05VuNlnegL0.html"}]}
