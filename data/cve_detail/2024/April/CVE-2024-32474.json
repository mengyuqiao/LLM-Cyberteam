{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32474", "Description": "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Prior to 24.4.1, when authenticating as a superuser to Sentry with a username and password, the password is leaked as cleartext in logs under the _event_: `auth-index.validate_superuser`. An attacker with access to the log data could use these leaked credentials to login to the Sentry system as superuser. Self-hosted users on affected versions should upgrade to 24.4.1 or later. Users can configure the logging level to exclude logs of the `INFO` level and only generate logs for levels at `WARNING` or more.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32474", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-117 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/117/Improper-Output-Neutralization-for-Logs.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/d5b34568d9f1c41362ccb62141532a0a2169512f", "ref_desc": "chore(auth): explicitly log challenge and response for debugging (#69\u2026 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry@d5b3456 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/66393", "ref_desc": "chore(superuser): Add logs to check u2f by schew2381 \u00b7 Pull Request #66393 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-6cjm-4pxw-7xp9", "ref_desc": "Superuser cleartext password leaked in logs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/69148", "ref_desc": "chore(auth): don't log validator by cathteng \u00b7 Pull Request #69148 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
