{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32651", "Description": "changedetection.io is an open source web page change detection, website watcher, restock monitor and notification service. There is a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Jinja2 that allows Remote Command Execution on the server host. Attackers can run any system command without any restriction and they could use a reverse shell. The impact is critical as the attacker can completely takeover the server machine. This can be reduced if changedetection is behind a login page, but this isn't required by the application (not by default and not enforced).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32651", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-08  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-05-27  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-09  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1336 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1336/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-Used-in-a-Templa.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-4r7v-whpg-8rx3", "ref_desc": "Server Side Template Injection in Jinja2 allows Remote Command Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dgtlmoon/changedetection.io \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.hacktivesecurity.com/index.php/2024/05/08/cve-2024-32651-server-side-template-injection-changedetection-io/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-32651 \u2013 Server Side Template Injection (Changedetection.io) \u2013 Hacktive Security Blog", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/releases/tag/0.45.21", "ref_desc": "Release 0.45.21 CVE-2024-32651 Critical security update \u00b7 dgtlmoon/changedetection.io \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.onsecurity.io/blog/server-side-template-injection-with-jinja2", "ref_desc": "Server Side Template Injection with Jinja2 for you now", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
