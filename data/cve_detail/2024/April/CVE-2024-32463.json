{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32463", "Description": "phlex is an open source framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. The filter to detect and prevent the use of the `javascript:` URL scheme in the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag could be bypassed with tab `\\t` or newline `\\n` characters between the characters of the protocol, e.g. `java\\tscript:`. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.1, 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.7.2, 1.6.3, 1.5.3, and 1.4.2. Configuring a Content Security Policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline` would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32463", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy", "ref_desc": "Content-Security-Policy - HTTP | MDNCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iVP9u078ss022ePkIc6m0timeU8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline", "ref_desc": "Content-Security-Policy - HTTP | MDNCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jBkQ5EIJHK3Jv-0oouG-59BeShQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/9e3f5b980655817993682e409cbda72956d865cb", "ref_desc": "Fix XSS \u00b7 phlex-ruby/phlex@9e3f5b9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) possible due to improper sanitisation of `href` attributes on `<a>` tags \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 phlex-ruby/phlex \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
