{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32019", "Description": "Netdata is an open source observability tool. In affected versions the `ndsudo` tool shipped with affected versions of the Netdata Agent allows an attacker to run arbitrary programs with root permissions. The `ndsudo` tool is packaged as a `root`-owned executable with the SUID bit set. It only runs a restricted set of external commands, but its search paths are supplied by the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker to control where `ndsudo` looks for these commands, which may be a path the attacker has write access to. This may lead to local privilege escalation. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.45.3 and 1.45.2-169. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32019", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/netdata/netdata/pull/17377", "ref_desc": "hardcode ndsudo PATH by ilyam8 \u00b7 Pull Request #17377 \u00b7 netdata/netdata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netdata/netdata/security/advisories/GHSA-pmhq-4cxq-wj93", "ref_desc": "ndsudo: local privilege escalation via untrusted search path \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 netdata/netdata \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
