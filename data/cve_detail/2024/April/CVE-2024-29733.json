{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29733", "Description": "Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in Apache Airflow FTP Provider.\n\nThe FTP hook lacks complete certificate validation in FTP_TLS connections, which can potentially be leveraged. Implementing proper certificate validation by passing context=ssl.create_default_context() during FTP_TLS instantiation is used as mitigation to validate the certificates properly.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Airflow FTP Provider: before 3.7.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.7.0, which fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29733", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#best-defaults", "ref_desc": "ssl \u2014 TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects \u2014 Python 3.12.3 documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/265t5zbmtjs6h9fkw52wtp03nsbplky2", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-29733: Apache Airflow FTP Provider: FTP_TLS instance with unverified SSL context-Apache Mail Archives", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/19/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2024-29733: Apache Airflow FTP Provider: FTP_TLS instance with unverified SSL context", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38266", "ref_desc": "Add ssl context for verification of certs in FTPS hook by amoghrajesh \u00b7 Pull Request #38266 \u00b7 apache/airflow \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/95e26118b828c364755f3a8c96870f3591b01c31/airflow/providers/ftp/hooks/ftp.py#L280", "ref_desc": "airflow/airflow/providers/ftp/hooks/ftp.py at 95e26118b828c364755f3a8c96870f3591b01c31 \u00b7 apache/airflow \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
