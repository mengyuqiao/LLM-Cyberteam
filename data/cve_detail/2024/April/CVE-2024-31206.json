{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31206", "Description": "dectalk-tts is a Node package to interact with the aeiou Dectalk web API. In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`, network requests to the third-party API are sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could be the victim of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The network request was upgraded to HTTPS in version `1.0.1`. There are no workarounds, but some precautions include not sending any sensitive information and carefully verifying the API response before saving it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31206", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-300 Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/300/Channel-Accessible-by-Non-Endpoint.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-598 Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/598/Use-of-GET-Request-Method-With-Sensitive-Query-Strings.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/pull/4", "ref_desc": "Send request over HTTPS by JstnMcBrd \u00b7 Pull Request #4 \u00b7 JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/commit/3600d8ac156f27da553ac4ead46d16989a350105", "ref_desc": "Send request over HTTPS (#4) \u00b7 JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts@3600d8a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/security/advisories/GHSA-6cf6-8hvr-r68w", "ref_desc": "Use of Unencrypted HTTP Request in dectalk-tts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/blob/b3e92156cbb699218ac9b9c7d8979abd0e635767/src/index.ts#L18", "ref_desc": "dectalk-tts/src/index.ts at b3e92156cbb699218ac9b9c7d8979abd0e635767 \u00b7 JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/issues/3", "ref_desc": "API requests may be sent via HTTP instead of HTTPS \u00b7 Issue #3 \u00b7 JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
