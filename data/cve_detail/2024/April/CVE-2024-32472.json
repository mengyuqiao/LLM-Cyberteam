{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32472", "Description": "excalidraw is an open source virtual hand-drawn style whiteboard. A stored XSS vulnerability in Excalidraw's web embeddable component. This allows arbitrary JavaScript to be run in the context of the domain where the editor is hosted. There were two vectors. One rendering untrusted string as iframe's `srcdoc` without properly sanitizing against HTML injection. Second by improperly sanitizing against attribute HTML injection. This in conjunction with allowing `allow-same-origin` sandbox flag (necessary for several embeds) resulted in the XSS. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.17.6 and 0.16.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32472", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/commit/6be752e1b6d776ccfbd3bb9eea17463cb264121d", "ref_desc": "fix: allow same origin for all necessary domains (#7889) \u00b7 excalidraw/excalidraw@6be752e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/security/advisories/GHSA-m64q-4jqh-f72f", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in excalidraw's web embed component \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 excalidraw/excalidraw \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/commit/988f81911ca58e3ca2583e0dd44a954dd00e09d0", "ref_desc": "fix: allow same origin for all necessary domains (#7889) \u00b7 excalidraw/excalidraw@988f819 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
