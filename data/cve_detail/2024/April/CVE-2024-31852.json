{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31852", "Description": "LLVM before 18.1.3 generates code in which the LR register can be overwritten without data being saved to the stack, and thus there can sometimes be an exploitable error in the flow of control. This affects the ARM backend and can be demonstrated with Clang. NOTE: the vendor perspective is \"we don't have strong objections for a CVE to be created ... It does seem that the likelihood of this miscompile enabling an exploit remains very low, because the miscompile resulting in this JOP gadget is such that the function is most likely to crash on most valid inputs to the function. So, if this function is covered by any testing, the miscompile is most likely to be discovered before the binary is shipped to production.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31852", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://llvm.org/docs/Security.html", "ref_desc": "LLVM Security Group \u2014 LLVM 19.0.0git documentationCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3j_im6LVOb3rQbkqsKZIzC-GYrk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/llvmbot/llvm-project/commit/0e16af8e4cf3a66ad5d078d52744ae2776f9c4b2", "ref_desc": "[ARM] Update IsRestored for LR based on all returns (#82745) \u00b7 llvmbot/llvm-project@0e16af8 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/80287", "ref_desc": "[Bug][Clang][ARM] Wrong assembly code generation, \"LR\" corrupted. \u00b7 Issue #80287 \u00b7 llvm/llvm-project \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/llvm/issues/detail?id=69", "ref_desc": "69 - Wrong assembly code generation.
