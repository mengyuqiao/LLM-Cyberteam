{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29903", "Description": "Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, maliciously-crafted software artifacts can cause denial of service of the machine running Cosign thereby impacting all services on the machine. The root cause is that Cosign creates slices based on the number of signatures, manifests or attestations in untrusted artifacts. As such, the untrusted artifact can control the amount of memory that Cosign allocates. The exact issue is Cosign allocates excessive memory on the lines that creates a slice of the same length as the manifests. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29903", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commit/629f5f8fa672973503edde75f84dcd984637629e", "ref_desc": "Fixes for GHSA-88jx-383q-w4qc and GHSA-95pr-fxf5-86gv (#3661) \u00b7 sigstore/cosign@629f5f8 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_ddyicIzoHRspFDkblmxmXnvurw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/14795db16417579fac0c00c11e166868d7976b61/pkg/cosign/verify.go#L948-L955", "ref_desc": "cosign/pkg/cosign/verify.go at 14795db16417579fac0c00c11e166868d7976b61 \u00b7 sigstore/cosign \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-95pr-fxf5-86gv", "ref_desc": "Malicious artifacts can cause machine-wide DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sigstore/cosign \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/286a98a4a99c1b2f32f84b0d560e324100312280/pkg/oci/remote/signatures.go#L56-L70", "ref_desc": "cosign/pkg/oci/remote/signatures.go at 286a98a4a99c1b2f32f84b0d560e324100312280 \u00b7 sigstore/cosign \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/tag/v2.2.4", "ref_desc": "Release v2.2.4 \u00b7 sigstore/cosign \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rYGASHTkJsWMoP-w9Ssd7gBwBUo.html"}]}
