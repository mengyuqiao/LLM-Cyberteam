{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-30726", "Description": "A shell injection vulnerability was discovered in ROS (Robot Operating System) Kinetic Kame in ROS_VERSION 1 and ROS_ PYTHON_VERSION 3, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and obtain sensitive information due to the way ROS handles shell command execution in components like command interpreters or interfaces that process external inputs. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30726", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-27  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 \n 2  2024-05-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yashpatelphd/CVE-2024-30726", "ref_desc": "GitHub - yashpatelphd/CVE-2024-30726: Shell Injection Vulnerability in ROS Kinetic Kame", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jXt4A209jgtGWXeoSEyBUKOOMxg.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Mgg78h5_k6LWdnxzrs9Ow5VyHKA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ObdzCuH3Co0iyLfzlZUUdbs8JH0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s50QOweWZO8DnZiKflxrVT-5Jes.html"}]}
