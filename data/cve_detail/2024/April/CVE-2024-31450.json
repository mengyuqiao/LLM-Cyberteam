{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31450", "Description": "Owncast is an open source, self-hosted, decentralized, single user live video streaming and chat server. The Owncast application exposes an administrator API at the URL /api/admin. The emoji/delete endpoint of said API allows administrators to delete custom emojis, which are saved on disk. The parameter name is taken from the JSON request and directly appended to the filepath that points to the emoji to delete. By using path traversal sequences (../), attackers with administrative privileges can exploit this endpoint to delete arbitrary files on the system, outside of the emoji directory. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.1.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31450", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/owncast/owncast/blob/v0.1.2/controllers/admin/emoji.go#L63", "ref_desc": "owncast/controllers/admin/emoji.go at v0.1.2 \u00b7 owncast/owncast \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-277_Owncast/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-277: Arbitrary File Deletion (AFD) in Owncast - CVE-2024-31450 | GitHub Security Lab", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/owncast/owncast/commit/1b14800c7d7f54be14ed4d130bfe7f480645076e", "ref_desc": "fix(api): protect emoji delete api from path traversal exploit \u00b7 owncast/owncast@1b14800 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/owncast/owncast/releases/tag/v0.1.3", "ref_desc": "Release Owncast v0.1.3 \u00b7 owncast/owncast \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
