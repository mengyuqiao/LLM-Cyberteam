{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-29905", "Description": "DIRAC is an interware, meaning a software framework for distributed computing. Prior to version 8.0.41, during the proxy generation process (e.g., when using `dirac-proxy-init`), it is possible for unauthorized users on the same machine to gain read access to the proxy. This allows the user to then perform any action that is possible with the original proxy. This vulnerability only exists for a short period of time (sub-millsecond) during the generation process. Version 8.0.41 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, setting the `X509_USER_PROXY` environment variable to a path that is inside a directory that is only readable to the current user avoids the potential risk. After the file has been written, it can be safely copied to the standard location (`/tmp/x509up_uNNNN`).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29905", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/security/advisories/GHSA-v6f3-gh5h-mqwx", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized users can read proxy contents during generation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DIRACGrid/DIRAC \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/commit/1faa709341969a6321e29c843ca94039d33b2c3d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-v6f3-gh5h-mqwx \u00b7 DIRACGrid/DIRAC@1faa709 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
