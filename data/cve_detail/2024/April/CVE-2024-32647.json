{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32647", "Description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.10 and prior, using the `create_from_blueprint` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when `raw_args=True` and the `args` argument has side-effects. It can be seen that the `_build_create_IR` function of the `create_from_blueprint` builtin doesn't cache the mentioned `args` argument to the stack. As such, it can be evaluated multiple times (instead of retrieving the value from the stack). No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32647", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-95 Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/95/Improper-Neutralization-of-Directives-in-Dynamically-Evaluat.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/cedf7087e68e67c7bfbd47ae95dcb16b81ad2e02/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L1847", "ref_desc": "vyper/vyper/builtins/functions.py at cedf7087e68e67c7bfbd47ae95dcb16b81ad2e02 \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-3whq-64q2-qfj6", "ref_desc": "double eval of raw_args in create_from_blueprint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
