{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31995", "Description": "`@digitalbazaar/zcap` provides JavaScript reference implementation for Authorization Capabilities. Prior to version 9.0.1, when invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked against the current date or other `date` param.  This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material. `@digitalbazaar/zcap` v9.0.1 fixes expiration checking. As a workaround, one may revoke a zcap at any time.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31995", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/commit/261eea040109b6e25159c88d8ed49d3c37f8fcfe", "ref_desc": "Fix chain-depth-2 zcap invocation expiry check. \u00b7 digitalbazaar/zcap@261eea0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/pull/82", "ref_desc": "Fix chain-depth-2 zcap invocation expiry check. by dlongley \u00b7 Pull Request #82 \u00b7 digitalbazaar/zcap \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/security/advisories/GHSA-hp8h-7x69-4wmv", "ref_desc": "Incomplete expiration checks in capability chains. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 digitalbazaar/zcap \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/commit/55f8549c80124b85dfb0f3dcf83f2c63f42532e5", "ref_desc": "Express expectation of node >= 18. \u00b7 digitalbazaar/zcap@55f8549 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
