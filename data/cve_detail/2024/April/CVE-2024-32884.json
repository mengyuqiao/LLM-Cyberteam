{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32884", "Description": "gitoxide is a pure Rust implementation of Git. `gix-transport` does not check the username part of a URL for text that the external `ssh` program would interpret as an option. A specially crafted clone URL can smuggle options to SSH. The possibilities are syntactically limited, but if a malicious clone URL is used by an application whose current working directory contains a malicious file, arbitrary code execution occurs. This is related to the patched vulnerability GHSA-rrjw-j4m2-mf34, but appears less severe due to a greater attack complexity. This issue has been patched in versions 0.35.0, 0.42.0 and 0.62.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32884", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0335.html", "ref_desc": "RUSTSEC-2024-0335: gix-transport: gix-transport indirect code execution via malicious username \u203a RustSec Advisory Database", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-98p4-xjmm-8mfh", "ref_desc": "gix-transport indirect code execution via malicious username \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Byron/gitoxide \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
