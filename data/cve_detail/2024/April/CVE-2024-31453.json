{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31453", "Description": "PsiTransfer is an open source, self-hosted file sharing solution. Prior to version 2.2.0, the absence of restrictions on the endpoint, which allows users to create a path for uploading a file in a file distribution, allows an attacker to add arbitrary files to the distribution. The vulnerability allows an attacker to influence those users who come to the file distribution after them and slip the victim files with a malicious or phishing signature. Version 2.2.0 contains a patch for the issue.\n\nCVE-2024-31453 allows users to violate the integrity of a file bucket and upload new files there, while the vulnerability with the number CVE-2024-31454 allows users to violate the integrity of a single file that is uploaded by another user by writing data there and not allows you to upload new files to the bucket. Thus, vulnerabilities are reproduced differently, require different security recommendations and affect different objects of the application\u2019s business logic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31453", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/psi-4ward/psitransfer/commit/b9853c97e6911e1c1c5341245ca1eb363fda5269", "ref_desc": "Restrict upload to a file which upload completed already \u00b7 psi-4ward/psitransfer@b9853c9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/psi-4ward/psitransfer/security/advisories/GHSA-xg8v-m2mh-45m6", "ref_desc": "Violation of the integrity of file distribution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 psi-4ward/psitransfer \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
