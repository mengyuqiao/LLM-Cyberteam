{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-32480", "Description": "LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Versions prior to 24.4.0 are vulnerable to SQL injection. The `order` parameter is obtained from `$request`. After performing a string check, the value is directly incorporated into an SQL statement and concatenated, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker may extract a whole database this way. Version 24.4.0 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32480", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-jh57-j3vq-h438", "ref_desc": "Time-Based Blind SQL injection leads to database extraction \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 librenms/librenms \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/83fe4b10c440d69a47fe2f8616e290ba2bd3a27c", "ref_desc": "Improve order validation in list_devices function to prevent SQL inje\u2026 \u00b7 librenms/librenms@83fe4b1 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
