{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31981", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.0.1 and prior to versions 4.10.20, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, remote code execution is possible via PDF export templates. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.20, 15.5.4 and 15.10-rc-1. If PDF templates are not typically used on the instance, an administrator can create the document `XWiki.PDFClass` and block its edition, after making sure that it does not contain a `style` attribute. Otherwise, there are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31981", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21337", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-21337] Privilege escalation (PR) from user registration through PDFClass - XWiki.org JIRA", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/a4ad14d9c1605a5ab957237e505ebbb29f5b9d73", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21337: Apply PDF templates with the rights of their authors \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@a4ad14d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-vxwr-wpjv-qjq7", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation (PR) from user registration through PDFClass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d28e21a670c69880b951e415dd2ddd69d273eae9", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21337: Apply PDF templates with the rights of their authors \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@d28e21a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/480186f9d2fca880513da8bc5a609674d106cbd3", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21337: Apply PDF templates with the rights of their authors \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@480186f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
