{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-31208", "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. A remote Matrix user with malicious intent, sharing a room with Synapse instances before 1.105.1, can dispatch specially crafted events to exploit a weakness in the V2 state resolution algorithm. This can induce high CPU consumption and accumulate excessive data in the database of such instances, resulting in a denial of service. Servers in private federations, or those that do not federate, are not affected. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.105.1 or later. Some workarounds are available. One can ban the malicious users or ACL block servers from the rooms and/or leave the room and purge the room using the admin API.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31208", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.105.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.105.1 \u00b7 element-hq/synapse \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/R6FCCO4ODTZ3FDS7TMW76PKOSEL2TQVB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: matrix-synapse-1.105.1-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VSF4NJJSTSQRJQ47PLYYSCFYKJBP7DET/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: matrix-synapse-1.105.1-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3h7q-rfh9-xm4v", "ref_desc": "Weakness in auth chain indexing allows DoS from remote room members through disk fill and high CPU usage \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 element-hq/synapse \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/commit/55b0aa847a61774b6a3acdc4b177a20dc019f01a", "ref_desc": "Fix GHSA-3h7q-rfh9-xm4v \u00b7 element-hq/synapse@55b0aa8 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RR53FNHV446CB37TP45GZ6F6HZLZCK3K/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: matrix-synapse-1.105.1-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
