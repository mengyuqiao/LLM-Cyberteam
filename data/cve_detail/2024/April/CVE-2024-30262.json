{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-30262", "Description": "Contao is an open source content management system. Prior to version 4.13.40, when a frontend member changes their password in the personal data or the password lost module, the corresponding remember-me tokens are not removed. If someone compromises an account and is able to get a remember-me token, changing the password would not be enough to reclaim control over the account. Version 4.13.40 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, disable \"Allow auto login\" in the login module.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30262", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contao/contao/security/advisories/GHSA-r4r6-j2j3-7pp5", "ref_desc": "Remember-me tokens are not cleared after a password change \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contao/contao \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contao/contao/commit/3032baa456f607169ffae82a8920354adb338fe9", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-r4r6-j2j3-7pp5 \u00b7 contao/contao@3032baa \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
