{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38513", "Description": "Fiber is an Express-inspired web framework written in Go A vulnerability present in versions prior to 2.52.5 is a session middleware issue in GoFiber versions 2 and above. This vulnerability allows users to supply their own session_id value, resulting in the creation of a session with that key. If a website relies on the mere presence of a session for security purposes, this can lead to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and session fixation attacks. All users utilizing GoFiber's session middleware in the affected versions are impacted. The issue has been addressed in version 2.52.5. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 2.52.5 or higher to mitigate this vulnerability. Users who are unable to upgrade immediately can apply the following workarounds to reduce the risk: Either implement additional validation to ensure session IDs are not supplied by the user and are securely generated by the server, or regularly rotate session IDs and enforce strict session expiration policies.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38513", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-98j2-3j3p-fw2v", "ref_desc": "Session Middleware Token Injection Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gofiber/fiber \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/commit/66a881441b27322a331f1b526cf1eb6b3358a4d8", "ref_desc": "fix(middleware/session): mutex for thread safety (#3050) \u00b7 gofiber/fiber@66a8814 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
