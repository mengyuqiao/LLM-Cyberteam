{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42100", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: sunxi-ng: common: Don't call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common\n\nIn order to set the rate range of a hw sunxi_ccu_probe calls\nhw_to_ccu_common() assuming all entries in desc->ccu_clks are contained\nin a ccu_common struct. This assumption is incorrect and, in\nconsequence, causes invalid pointer de-references.\n\nRemove the faulty call. Instead, add one more loop that iterates over\nthe ccu_clks and sets the rate range, if required.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42100", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ea977d742507e534d9fe4f4d74256f6b7f589338", "ref_desc": "clk: sunxi-ng: common: Don't call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7a0e2738cb6da5a55c9908dff333600aeb263e07", "ref_desc": "clk: sunxi-ng: common: Don't call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/14c78d69dbca6a28af14095f639ec4318ec07fdc", "ref_desc": "clk: sunxi-ng: common: Don't call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
