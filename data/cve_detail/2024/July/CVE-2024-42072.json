{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42072", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix may_goto with negative offset.\n\nZac's syzbot crafted a bpf prog that exposed two bugs in may_goto.\nThe 1st bug is the way may_goto is patched. When offset is negative\nit should be patched differently.\nThe 2nd bug is in the verifier:\nwhen current state may_goto_depth is equal to visited state may_goto_depth\nit means there is an actual infinite loop. It's not correct to prune\nexploration of the program at this point.\nNote, that this check doesn't limit the program to only one may_goto insn,\nsince 2nd and any further may_goto will increment may_goto_depth only\nin the queued state pushed for future exploration. The current state\nwill have may_goto_depth == 0 regardless of number of may_goto insns\nand the verifier has to explore the program until bpf_exit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42072", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.9.1andbefore (<) 6.9.8cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.9cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2b2efe1937ca9f8815884bd4dcd5b32733025103", "ref_desc": "bpf: Fix may_goto with negative offset. - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/175827e04f4be53f3dfb57edf12d0d49b18fd939", "ref_desc": "bpf: Fix may_goto with negative offset. - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
