{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40950", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: huge_memory: fix misused mapping_large_folio_support() for anon folios\n\nWhen I did a large folios split test, a WARNING \"[ 5059.122759][ T166]\nCannot split file folio to non-0 order\" was triggered.  But the test cases\nare only for anonmous folios.  while mapping_large_folio_support() is only\nreasonable for page cache folios.\n\nIn split_huge_page_to_list_to_order(), the folio passed to\nmapping_large_folio_support() maybe anonmous folio.  The folio_test_anon()\ncheck is missing.  So the split of the anonmous THP is failed.  This is\nalso the same for shmem_mapping().  We'd better add a check for both.  But\nthe shmem_mapping() in __split_huge_page() is not involved, as for\nanonmous folios, the end parameter is set to -1, so (head[i].index >= end)\nis always false.  shmem_mapping() is not called.\n\nAlso add a VM_WARN_ON_ONCE() in mapping_large_folio_support() for anon\nmapping, So we can detect the wrong use more easily.\n\nTHP folios maybe exist in the pagecache even the file system doesn't\nsupport large folio, it is because when CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is\nenabled, khugepaged will try to collapse read-only file-backed pages to\nTHP.  But the mapping does not actually support multi order large folios\nproperly.\n\nUsing /sys/kernel/debug/split_huge_pages to verify this, with this patch,\nlarge anon THP is successfully split and the warning is ceased.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40950", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5df493a99fcf887133cf01d23cd4bebb6d385d3c", "ref_desc": "mm: huge_memory: fix misused mapping_large_folio_support() for anon folios - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6a50c9b512f7734bc356f4bd47885a6f7c98491a", "ref_desc": "mm: huge_memory: fix misused mapping_large_folio_support() for anon folios - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
