{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41672", "Description": "DuckDB is a SQL database management system. In versions 1.0.0 and prior, content in filesystem is accessible for reading using `sniff_csv`, even with `enable_external_access=false`. This vulnerability provides an attacker with access to filesystem even when access is expected to be disabled and other similar functions do NOT provide access. There seem to be two vectors to this vulnerability. First, access to files that should otherwise not be allowed. Second, the content from a file can be read (e.g. `/etc/hosts`, `proc/self/environ`, etc) even though that doesn't seem to be the intent of the sniff_csv function. A fix for this issue is available in commit c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a and is expected to be part of version 1.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41672", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDuckdb\u00bbDuckdbVersions  before (<) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:duckdb:duckdb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13133", "ref_desc": "Disable sniff_csv when enable_external_access is not set by hannes \u00b7 Pull Request #13133 \u00b7 duckdb/duckdb \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/security/advisories/GHSA-w2gf-jxc9-pf2q", "ref_desc": "sniff_csv provides filesystem access even when enable_external_access is disabled \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 duckdb/duckdb \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/commit/c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #13133 from hannes/sniffexternal \u00b7 duckdb/duckdb@c9b7c98 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
