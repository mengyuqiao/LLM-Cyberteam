{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39912", "Description": "web-auth/webauthn-lib is an open source set of PHP libraries and a Symfony bundle to allow developers to integrate that authentication mechanism into their web applications. The ProfileBasedRequestOptionsBuilder method returns allowedCredentials without any credentials if no username was found. When WebAuthn is used as the first or only authentication method, an attacker can enumerate usernames based on the absence of the `allowedCredentials` property in the assertion options response. This allows enumeration of valid or invalid usernames. By knowing which usernames are valid, attackers can focus their efforts on a smaller set of potential targets, increasing the efficiency and likelihood of successful attacks. This issue has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39912", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-204 Observable Response Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/204/Observable-Response-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/web-auth/webauthn-framework/security/advisories/GHSA-875x-g8p7-5w27", "ref_desc": "Enumeration of valid usernames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 web-auth/webauthn-framework \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/web-auth/webauthn-framework/commit/64de11f6cddc71e56c76e0cc4573bf94d02be045", "ref_desc": "Add feature to hide existing credentials \u00b7 web-auth/webauthn-framework@64de11f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
