{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42112", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: txgbe: free isb resources at the right time\n\nWhen using MSI/INTx interrupt, the shared interrupts are still being\nhandled in the device remove routine, before free IRQs. So isb memory\nis still read after it is freed. Thus move wx_free_isb_resources()\nfrom txgbe_close() to txgbe_remove(). And fix the improper isb free\naction in txgbe_open() error handling path.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42112", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/efdc3f54299835ddef23bea651c753c4d467010b", "ref_desc": "net: txgbe: free isb resources at the right time - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/935124dd5883b5de68dc5a94f582480a10643dc9", "ref_desc": "net: txgbe: free isb resources at the right time - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
