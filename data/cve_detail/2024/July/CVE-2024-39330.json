{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39330", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14. Derived classes of the django.core.files.storage.Storage base class, when they override generate_filename() without replicating the file-path validations from the parent class, potentially allow directory traversal via certain inputs during a save() call. (Built-in Storage sub-classes are unaffected.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39330", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/django-announce", "ref_desc": "Sign in - Google AccountsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2XtVUiFb8mqajovfjsvRevCjbJU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/security/", "ref_desc": "Archive of security issues | Django documentation | DjangoCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/InwfdzuHdb1agC8uMwH31EJtlGA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/jul/09/security-releases/", "ref_desc": "Django security releases issued: 5.0.7 and 4.2.14 | Weblog | DjangoCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YAr5OeuFcnywKdL5mnm6vpsdd7M.html"}]}
