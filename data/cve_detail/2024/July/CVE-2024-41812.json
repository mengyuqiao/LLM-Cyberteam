{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41812", "Description": "txtdot is an HTTP proxy that parses only text, links, and pictures from pages, removing ads and heavy scripts. Prior to version 1.7.0, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `/get` route of txtdot allows remote attackers to use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve information in the internal network. Version 1.7.0 prevents displaying the response of forged requests, but the requests can still be sent. For complete mitigation, a firewall between txtdot and other internal network resources should be set.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41812", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nTxtdot\u00bbTxtdotVersions  before (<) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:txtdot:txtdot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-01  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/blob/a7fdaf80fdf45abefe83b2eb5135ba112142dc74/src/handlers/distributor.ts#L43-L47", "ref_desc": "txtdot/src/handlers/distributor.ts at a7fdaf80fdf45abefe83b2eb5135ba112142dc74 \u00b7 TxtDot/txtdot \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nrjVj9c7mpzC95y_thOFLCwNJgM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/commit/7c72d985f7a26ec1fd3cf628444717ca54986d2d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-4gj5-xj97-j8fp \u00b7 TxtDot/txtdot@7c72d98 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/security/advisories/GHSA-4gj5-xj97-j8fp", "ref_desc": "txtdot SSRF vulnerability in /get \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TxtDot/txtdot \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
