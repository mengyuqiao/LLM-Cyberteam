{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39557", "Description": "An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the \n\nLayer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald)\n\n of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak, eventually exhausting all system memory, leading to a system crash and Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nCertain MAC table updates cause a small amount of memory to leak.\u00a0 Once memory utilization reaches its limit, the issue will result in a system crash and restart.\n\nTo identify the issue, execute the CLI command:\n \nuser@device> show platform application-info allocations app l2ald-agent\nEVL Object Allocation Statistics:\n \n Node  \u00a0 Application  \u00a0 \u00a0  Context   Name  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Live  \u00a0  Allocs  \u00a0  Fails  \u00a0 \u00a0  Guids\n re0  \u00a0  l2ald-agent  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  net::juniper::rtnh::L2Rtinfo  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  1069096  1069302  \u00a0 0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  1069302\n re0  \u00a0  l2ald-agent  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  net::juniper::rtnh::NHOpaqueTlv  \u00a0 \u00a0  114  \u00a0 \u00a0 195  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  195\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,\n\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 22.3-EVO\u00a0before 22.3R3-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39557", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA83017", "ref_desc": "2024-07 Security Bulletin: Junos OS Evolved: MAC table changes cause a memory leak (CVE-2024-39557)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
