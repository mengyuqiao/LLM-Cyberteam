{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39696", "Description": "Evmos is a decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine chain on the Cosmos Network. Prior to version 19.0.0, a user can create a vesting account with a 3rd party account (EOA or contract) as funder. Then, this user can create an authorization for the contract.CallerAddress, this is the authorization checked in the code. But the funds are taken from the funder address provided in the message. Consequently, the user can fund a vesting account with a 3rd party account without its permission. The funder address can be any address, so this vulnerability can be used to drain all the accounts in the chain. The issue has been patched in version 19.0.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39696", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/evmos/evmos/commit/0a620e176617a835ac697eea494afea09185dfaf", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-q6hg-6m9x-5g9c \u00b7 evmos/evmos@0a620e1 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/evmos/evmos/security/advisories/GHSA-q6hg-6m9x-5g9c", "ref_desc": "Precompiles exploit of smart contract account and vesting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 evmos/evmos \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
