{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39701", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus >=9.23.0, <=v10.5.3 improperly handles _in, _nin operators. It evaluates empty arrays as valid so expressions like {\"role\": {\"_in\": $CURRENT_USER.some_field}} would evaluate to true allowing the request to pass. This results in Broken Access Control because the rule fails to do what it was intended to do: Pass rule if **field** matches any of the **values**.
