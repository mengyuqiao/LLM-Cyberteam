{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41067", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly\n\n[BUG]\nWhen running btrfs/060 with forced RST feature, it would crash the\nfollowing ASSERT() inside scrub_read_endio():\n\n\tASSERT(sector_nr < stripe->nr_sectors);\n\nBefore that, we would have tree dump from\nbtrfs_get_raid_extent_offset(), as we failed to find the RST entry for\nthe range.\n\n[CAUSE]\nInside scrub_submit_extent_sector_read() every time we allocated a new\nbbio we immediately called btrfs_map_block() to make sure there was some\nRST range covering the scrub target.\n\nBut if btrfs_map_block() fails, we immediately call endio for the bbio,\nwhile the bbio is newly allocated, it's completely empty.\n\nThen inside scrub_read_endio(), we go through the bvecs to find\nthe sector number (as bi_sector is no longer reliable if the bio is\nsubmitted to lower layers).\n\nAnd since the bio is empty, such bvecs iteration would not find any\nsector matching the sector, and return sector_nr == stripe->nr_sectors,\ntriggering the ASSERT().\n\n[FIX]\nInstead of calling btrfs_map_block() after allocating a new bbio, call\nbtrfs_map_block() first.\n\nSince our only objective of calling btrfs_map_block() is only to update\nstripe_len, there is really no need to do that after btrfs_alloc_bio().\n\nThis new timing would avoid the problem of handling empty bbio\ncompletely, and in fact fixes a possible race window for the old code,\nwhere if the submission thread is the only owner of the pending_io, the\nscrub would never finish (since we didn't decrease the pending_io\ncounter).\n\nAlthough the root cause of RST lookup failure still needs to be\naddressed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41067", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2c49908634a2b97b1c3abe0589be2739ac5e7fd5", "ref_desc": "btrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/17d1fd302a53d7e456a7412da74be74a0cf63a72", "ref_desc": "btrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
