{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39916", "Description": "FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. There is a security issue with the NFS configuration in /etc/exports generated by the installer that allows an attacker to modify files outside the export in the default installation. The exports have the no_subtree_check option. The no_subtree_check option means that if a client performs a file operation, the server will only check if the requested file is on the correct filesystem, not if it is in the correct directory. This enables modifying files in /images, accessing other files on the same filesystem, and accessing files on other filesystems. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.10.30.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39916", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFogproject\u00bbFogprojectVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.5.10cpe:2.3:a:fogproject:fogproject:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-453 Insecure Default Variable Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/453/Insecure-Default-Variable-Initialization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1188/Initialization-of-a-Resource-with-an-Insecure-Default.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/2de209bc57a177a052b4a877f000c591740b2f88", "ref_desc": "Should address potential security issue \u00b7 FOGProject/fogproject@2de209b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/security/advisories/GHSA-3xjr-xf9v-hwjh", "ref_desc": "NFS server misconfiguration allows file access outside the exported directory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FOGProject/fogproject \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
