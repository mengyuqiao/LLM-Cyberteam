{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39915", "Description": "Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface for Naemon, Nagios, Icinga and Shinken using the Livestatus API. This authenticated RCE in Thruk allows authorized users with network access to inject arbitrary commands via the URL parameter during PDF report generation. The Thruk web application does not properly process the url parameter when generating a PDF report. An authorized attacker with access to the reporting functionality could inject arbitrary commands that would be executed when the script /script/html2pdf.sh is called. The vulnerability can be exploited by an authorized user with network access. This issue has been addressed in version 3.16. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39915", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sni/Thruk/security/advisories/GHSA-r7gx-h738-4w6f", "ref_desc": "K-Thruk-2023-001 Authenticated RCE in Thruk 3.13 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sni/Thruk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sni/Thruk/commit/7e7eb251e76718a07639c4781f0d959d817f173b", "ref_desc": "fix using unescaped url in reports \u00b7 sni/Thruk@7e7eb25 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
