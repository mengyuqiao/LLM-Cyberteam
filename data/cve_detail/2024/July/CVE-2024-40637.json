{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40637", "Description": "dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications. When a user installs a package in dbt, it has the ability to override macros, materializations, and other core components of dbt. This is by design, as it allows packages to extend and customize dbt's functionality. However, this also means that a malicious package could potentially override these components with harmful code. This issue has been fixed in versions 1.8.0, 1.6.14 and 1.7.14. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no kn own workarounds for this vulnerability. Users updating to either 1.6.14 or 1.7.14 will need to set `flags.require_explicit_package_overrides_for_builtin_materializations: False` in their configuration in `dbt_project.yml`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40637", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDbt Labs\u00bbDbt-coreVersions  before (<) 1.6.14cpe:2.3:a:dbt_labs:dbt-core:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDbt Labs\u00bbDbt-coreVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.0andbefore (<) 1.7.14cpe:2.3:a:dbt_labs:dbt-core:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetdbt\u00bbDbt CoreVersions  before (<) 1.6.14cpe:2.3:a:getdbt:dbt_core:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetdbt\u00bbDbt CoreVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.0andbefore (<) 1.7.14cpe:2.3:a:getdbt:dbt_core:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-20  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/commit/87ac4deb00cc9fe334706e42a365903a1d581624", "ref_desc": "[Backport] deprecate materialization overrides from imported packages\u2026 \u00b7 dbt-labs/dbt-core@87ac4de \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages", "ref_desc": "Packages | dbt Developer HubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.equalexperts.com/blog/tech-focus/are-you-at-risk-from-this-critical-dbt-vulnerability", "ref_desc": "Are you at risk from this critical dbt vulnerability? | Equal ExpertsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tempered.works/posts/2024/07/06/preventing-data-theft-with-gcp-service-controls", "ref_desc": "Preventing data theft with GCP service controls - Tempered Works Ltd.Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.elementary-data.com/post/are-dbt-packages-secure-the-answer-lies-in-your-dwh-policies", "ref_desc": "Are dbt packages secure?
