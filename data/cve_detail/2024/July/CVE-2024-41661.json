{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41661", "Description": "reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. In versions 1.2.0 through 2.1.1, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the WAF detection tool allows an authenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands as root user. The URL query parameter `url` is passed to `subprocess.check_output` without any sanitization, resulting in a command injection vulnerability. This API endpoint is accessible by authenticated users with any use role. Because the process runs as `root`, an attacker has root access. Commit edd3c85ee16f93804ad38dac5602549d2d30a93e contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41661", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-30  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/blob/53d9f505f04861a5040195ea71f20907ff90577a/web/api/views.py#L268-L275", "ref_desc": "rengine/web/api/views.py at 53d9f505f04861a5040195ea71f20907ff90577a \u00b7 yogeshojha/rengine \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Jh7S_ntvyRQIIEO9CefSZ6wOl-w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/security/advisories/GHSA-fx7f-f735-vgh4", "ref_desc": "Authenticated command injection in WAF detection tool \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yogeshojha/rengine \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/k-6a517uG9EqEWvtO2Vqa4HXbHw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/commit/edd3c85ee16f93804ad38dac5602549d2d30a93e", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 yogeshojha/rengine@edd3c85 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TGoD6zJ-MpNxzJ9F8e7xE0VGxnU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/commit/3d5f1724dd12cf9861443742e7d7c02ff8c75a6f", "ref_desc": "Added WAF Detector Toolbox \u00b7 yogeshojha/rengine@3d5f172 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/urM6fAFroehdGu2zI1xS13PsZTc.html"}]}
