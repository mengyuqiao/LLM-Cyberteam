{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41084", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/region: Avoid null pointer dereference in region lookup\n\ncxl_dpa_to_region() looks up a region based on a memdev and DPA.\nIt wrongly assumes an endpoint found mapping the DPA is also of\na fully assembled region. When not true it leads to a null pointer\ndereference looking up the region name.\n\nThis appears during testing of region lookup after a failure to\nassemble a BIOS defined region or if the lookup raced with the\nassembly of the BIOS defined region.\n\nFailure to clean up BIOS defined regions that fail assembly is an\nissue in itself and a fix to that problem will alleviate some of\nthe impact. It will not alleviate the race condition so let's harden\nthis path.\n\nThe behavior change is that the kernel oops due to a null pointer\ndereference is replaced with a dev_dbg() message noting that an\nendpoint was mapped.\n\nAdditional comments are added so that future users of this function\ncan more clearly understand what it provides.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41084", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.4andbefore (<) 6.6.37cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.7andbefore (<) 6.9.8cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-23  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a9e099e29e925f8b31cfe53e8a786b9796f8e453", "ref_desc": "cxl/region: Avoid null pointer dereference in region lookup - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b8a40a6dbfb0150c1081384caa9bbe28ce5d5060", "ref_desc": "cxl/region: Avoid null pointer dereference in region lookup - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/285f2a08841432fc3e498b1cd00cce5216cdf189", "ref_desc": "cxl/region: Avoid null pointer dereference in region lookup - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
