{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40897", "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in orcparse.c of ORC versions prior to 0.4.39. If a developer is tricked to process a specially crafted file with the affected ORC compiler, an arbitrary code may be executed on the developer's build environment. This may lead to compromise of developer machines or CI build environments.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40897", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGstreamer\u00bbORCVersions  before (<) 0.4.39cpe:2.3:a:gstreamer:orc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGstreamer\u00bbORCVersions  before (<) 0.4.39cpe:2.3:a:gstreamer:orc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-28  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/orc.html", "ref_desc": "Product", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/26/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - GStreamer Security Advisory 2024-0003: Orc compiler stack-based buffer overflowThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN02030803/", "ref_desc": "JVN#02030803: ORC vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflowThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GStreamer/orc", "ref_desc": "GitHub - GStreamer/orc: Orc - Optimized Inner Loop Runtime CompilerProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
