{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39917", "Description": "xrdp is an open source RDP server. xrdp versions prior to 0.10.0 have a vulnerability that allows attackers to make an infinite number of login attempts. The number of max login attempts is supposed to be  limited by a configuration parameter `MaxLoginRetry` in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini`. However, this mechanism was not effectively working. As a result, xrdp allows an infinite number of login attempts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39917", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNeutrinolabs\u00bbXrdpVersions  before (<) 0.10.0cpe:2.3:a:neutrinolabs:xrdp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-06  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/security/advisories/GHSA-7w22-h4w7-8j5j", "ref_desc": "xrdp allows an ininite number of login attempts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 neutrinolabs/xrdp \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/commit/19c111c74c913ecc6e4ba9a738ed929a79d2ae8f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7w22-h4w7-8j5j \u00b7 neutrinolabs/xrdp@19c111c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
