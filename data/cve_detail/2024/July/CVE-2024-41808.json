{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41808", "Description": "The OpenObserve open-source observability platform provides the ability to filter logs in a dashboard by the values uploaded in a given log. However, all versions of the platform through 0.9.1 do not sanitize user input in the filter selection menu, which may result in complete account takeover. It has been noted that the front-end uses `DOMPurify` or Vue templating to escape cross-site scripting (XSS) extensively, however certain areas of the front end lack this XSS protection. When combining the missing protection with the insecure authentication handling that the front-end uses, a malicious user may be able to take over any victim's account provided they meet the exploitation steps. As of time of publication, no patched version is available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41808", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOpenobserve\u00bbOpenobserveVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.9.1cpe:2.3:a:openobserve:openobserve:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenobserve\u00bbOpenobserveVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.9.1cpe:2.3:a:openobserve:openobserve:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/security/advisories/GHSA-hx23-g7m8-h76j", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS may lead to complete account takeover \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openobserve/openobserve \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
