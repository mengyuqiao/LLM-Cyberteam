{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39514", "Description": "An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nAn attacker can send specific traffic to the device, which causes the rpd to crash and restart. Continued receipt of this traffic will result in a sustained DoS condition.\n\nThis issue only affects devices with an EVPN-VPWS instance with IGMP-snooping enabled.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS: \n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S6,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S2,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2;\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S6-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S5-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S2-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39514", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/703/Improper-Check-or-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA82980", "ref_desc": "2024-07 Security Bulletin: Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved: Receiving specific traffic on devices with EVPN-VPWS with IGMP-snooping enabled will cause the rpd to crash (CVE-2024-39514)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
