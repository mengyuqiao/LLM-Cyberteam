{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42088", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Add platform entry for ETDM1_OUT_BE dai link\n\nCommit e70b8dd26711 (\"ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Remove afe-dai component\nand rework codec link\") removed the codec entry for the ETDM1_OUT_BE\ndai link entirely instead of replacing it with COMP_EMPTY(). This worked\nby accident as the remaining COMP_EMPTY() platform entry became the codec\nentry, and the platform entry became completely empty, effectively the\nsame as COMP_DUMMY() since snd_soc_fill_dummy_dai() doesn't do anything\nfor platform entries.\n\nThis causes a KASAN out-of-bounds warning in mtk_soundcard_common_probe()\nin sound/soc/mediatek/common/mtk-soundcard-driver.c:\n\n\tfor_each_card_prelinks(card, i, dai_link) {\n\t\tif (adsp_node && !strncmp(dai_link->name, \"AFE_SOF\", strlen(\"AFE_SOF\")))\n\t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = adsp_node;\n\t\telse if (!dai_link->platforms->name && !dai_link->platforms->of_node)\n\t\t\tdai_link->platforms->of_node = platform_node;\n\t}\n\nwhere the code expects the platforms array to have space for at least one entry.\n\nAdd an COMP_EMPTY() entry so that dai_link->platforms has space.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42088", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/42b9ab7a4d7e6c5efd71847541e4fcc213585aad", "ref_desc": "ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Add platform entry for ETDM1_OUT_BE dai link - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/282a4482e198e03781c152c88aac8aa382ef9a55", "ref_desc": "ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Add platform entry for ETDM1_OUT_BE dai link - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
