{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41801", "Description": "OpenProject is open source project management software. Prior to version 14.3.0, using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the \"Login required\" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account. This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers. Version 14.3.0 includes stronger protections for the hostname from within the application using the HostAuthorization middleware of Rails to reject any requests with a host name that does not match the configured one. Also, all generated links by the application are now ensured to use the built-in hostname. Users who aren't able to upgrade immediately may use mod_security for Apache2 or manually fix the Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers in their proxying application before reaching the application server of OpenProject. Alternatively, they can manually apply the patch to opt-in to host header protections in previous versions of OpenProject.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41801", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenproject\u00bbOpenprojectVersions  before (<) 14.3.0cpe:2.3:a:openproject:openproject:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenproject\u00bbOpenprojectVersions  before (<) 14.3.0cpe:2.3:a:openproject:openproject:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16371759/host-protection.patch", "ref_desc": "Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openproject.org/docs/release-notes/14-3-0", "ref_desc": "OpenProject 14.3.0Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-g92v-vrq6-4fpw", "ref_desc": "Open Redirect Vulnerability in Sign-In in default configuration of OpenProject packaged installation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opf/openproject \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
