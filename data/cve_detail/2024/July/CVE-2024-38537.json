{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38537", "Description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard. Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38537", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-cvw4-c69g-7v7m", "ref_desc": "Inclusion of Untrusted polyfill.io Code Vulnerability in FidesJS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/pull/5026", "ref_desc": "Remove fetch polyfill from FidesJS by gilluminate \u00b7 Pull Request #5026 \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack", "ref_desc": "Polyfill supply chain attack hits 100K+ sitesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LGhPNTjoXtB3TQ_biRcuVnASE0M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org", "ref_desc": "Fetch Standard", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/868c4d629760572192bd61db34f5a4458ed12005", "ref_desc": "Remove fetch polyfill from FidesJS (#5026) \u00b7 ethyca/fides@868c4d6 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
