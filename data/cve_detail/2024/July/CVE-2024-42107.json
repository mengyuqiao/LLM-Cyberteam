{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42107", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabled\n\nThe ice_ptp_extts_event() function can race with ice_ptp_release() and\nresult in a NULL pointer dereference which leads to a kernel panic.\n\nPanic occurs because the ice_ptp_extts_event() function calls\nptp_clock_event() with a NULL pointer. The ice driver has already\nreleased the PTP clock by the time the interrupt for the next external\ntimestamp event occurs.\n\nTo fix this, modify the ice_ptp_extts_event() function to check the\nPTP state and bail early if PTP is not ready.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42107", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c4e524811918600683b1ea87a5e0fc2db64fa9b", "ref_desc": "ice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabled - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/996422e3230e41468f652d754fefd1bdbcd4604e", "ref_desc": "ice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabled - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
