{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38368", "Description": "trunk.cocoapods.org is the authentication server for the CoacoaPods dependency manager. A vulnerability affected older pods which migrated from the pre-2014 pull request workflow to trunk. If the pods had never been claimed then it was still possible to do so. It was also possible to have all owners removed from a pod, and that made the pod available for the same claiming system. This was patched server-side in commit 71be5440906b6bdfbc0bcc7f8a9fec33367ea0f4 in September 2023.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38368", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCocoapods\u00bbTrunk.cocoapods.org\u00bb     RubyEditionVersions  before (<) 2023-09-22cpe:2.3:a:cocoapods:trunk.cocoapods.org:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-19  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/security/advisories/GHSA-j483-qm5c-7hqx", "ref_desc": "Trunk's 'Claim your pod' could be used to obtain un-used pods \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CocoaPods/CocoaPods \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CocoaPods/trunk.cocoapods.org/commit/71be5440906b6bdfbc0bcc7f8a9fec33367ea0f4", "ref_desc": "Drop the claims feature \u00b7 CocoaPods/trunk.cocoapods.org@71be544 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://evasec.webflow.io/blog/eva-discovered-supply-chain-vulnerabities-in-cocoapods#1-taking-unauthorized-ownership-over-orphaned-pods", "ref_desc": "Vulnerabilities in CocoaPods Open the Door to Supply Chain Attacks Against Thousands of iOS and MacOS ApplicationsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Trunk-RCEs-2023", "ref_desc": "CocoaPods Trunk: 3 Remote Code Execution found, 2023 - CocoaPods BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/X4y9DAynii5xZPyq4RNaceLEBTA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.cocoapods.org/Claim-Your-Pods", "ref_desc": "Claim Your Pods - CocoaPods BlogProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
