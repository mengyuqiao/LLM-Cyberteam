{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40630", "Description": "OpenImageIO is a toolset for reading, writing, and manipulating image files of any image file format relevant to VFX / animation via a format-agnostic API with a feature set, scalability, and robustness needed for feature film production. In affected versions there is a bug in the heif input functionality of OpenImageIO. Specifically, in `HeifInput::seek_subimage()`.  In the worst case, this can lead to an information disclosure vulnerability, particularly for programs that directly use the `ImageInput` APIs. This bug has been addressed in commit `0a2dcb4c` which is included in the 2.5.13.1 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40630", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/blob/7c486a1121a4bf71d50ff555fab2770294b748d7/src/heif.imageio/heifinput.cpp#L250", "ref_desc": "OpenImageIO/src/heif.imageio/heifinput.cpp at 7c486a1121a4bf71d50ff555fab2770294b748d7 \u00b7 AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/security/advisories/GHSA-jjm9-9m4m-c8p2", "ref_desc": "HEIF Heap OOB Read \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/commit/0a2dcb4cf2c3fd4825a146cd3ad929d9d8305ce3", "ref_desc": "fix(heic): Correctly set imagespec size for heif images \u00b7 AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO@0a2dcb4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
