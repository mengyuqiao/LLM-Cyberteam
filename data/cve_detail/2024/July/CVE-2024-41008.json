{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41008", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: change vm->task_info handling\n\nThis patch changes the handling and lifecycle of vm->task_info object.\nThe major changes are:\n- vm->task_info is a dynamically allocated ptr now, and its uasge is\n  reference counted.\n- introducing two new helper funcs for task_info lifecycle management\n    - amdgpu_vm_get_task_info: reference counts up task_info before\n      returning this info\n    - amdgpu_vm_put_task_info: reference counts down task_info\n- last put to task_info() frees task_info from the vm.\n\nThis patch also does logistical changes required for existing usage\nof vm->task_info.\n\nV2: Do not block all the prints when task_info not found (Felix)\n\nV3: Fixed review comments from Felix\n   - Fix wrong indentation\n   - No debug message for -ENOMEM\n   - Add NULL check for task_info\n   - Do not duplicate the debug messages (ti vs no ti)\n   - Get first reference of task_info in vm_init(), put last\n     in vm_fini()\n\nV4: Fixed review comments from Felix\n   - fix double reference increment in create_task_info\n   - change amdgpu_vm_get_task_info_pasid\n   - additional changes in amdgpu_gem.c while porting", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41008", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b8f67b9ddf4f8fe6dd536590712b5912ad78f99c", "ref_desc": "drm/amdgpu: change vm->task_info handling - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
