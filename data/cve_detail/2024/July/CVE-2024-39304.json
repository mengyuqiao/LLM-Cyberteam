{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39304", "Description": "ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Versions of the application prior to 5.9.2 are vulnerable to an authenticated SQL injection due to an improper sanitization of user input. Authentication is required, but no elevated privileges are necessary. This allows attackers to inject SQL statements directly into the database query due to inadequate sanitization of the EID parameter in in a GET request to `/GetText.php`. Version 5.9.2 patches the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39304", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nChurchcrm\u00bbChurchcrmVersions  before (<) 5.9.2cpe:2.3:a:churchcrm:churchcrm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nChurchcrm\u00bbChurchcrmVersions  before (<) 5.9.2cpe:2.3:a:churchcrm:churchcrm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/commit/e3bd7bfbf33f01148df0ef1acdb0cf2c2b878b08", "ref_desc": "Fix sqli vuln (#7086) \u00b7 ChurchCRM/CRM@e3bd7bf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/security/advisories/GHSA-2rh6-gr3h-83j9", "ref_desc": "SQLi in ChurchCRM <= 5.8.0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ChurchCRM/CRM \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
