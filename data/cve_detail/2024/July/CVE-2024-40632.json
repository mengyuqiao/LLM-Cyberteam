{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40632", "Description": "Linkerd is an open source, ultralight, security-first service mesh for Kubernetes. In affected versions when the application being run by linkerd is susceptible to SSRF, an attacker could potentially trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by making requests to localhost:4191/shutdown. Linkerd could introduce an optional environment variable to control a token that must be passed as a header. Linkerd should reject shutdown requests that do not include this header. This issue has been addressed in release version edge-24.6.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40632", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/commit/35fb2d6d11ef6520ae516dd717790529f85224fa", "ref_desc": "feat!: Add config to disable proxy /shutdown admin endpoint (#12705) \u00b7 linkerd/linkerd2@35fb2d6 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/security/advisories/GHSA-6v94-gj6x-jqj7", "ref_desc": "Optionally require passing a header to invoke the shutdown endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 linkerd/linkerd2 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy/blob/46957de49f25fd4661af7b7c52659148f4d6dd27/linkerd/app/admin/src/server.rs", "ref_desc": "linkerd2-proxy/linkerd/app/admin/src/server.rs at 46957de49f25fd4661af7b7c52659148f4d6dd27 \u00b7 linkerd/linkerd2-proxy \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
