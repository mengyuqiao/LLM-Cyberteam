{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38519", "Description": "`yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` are command-line audio/video downloaders. Prior to the fixed versions,\u00a0`yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` do not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` also read config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` directory), this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.\n\n\n\n\n`yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions. `youtube-dl` fixes this issue in commit `d42a222` on the `master` branch and in nightly builds tagged 2024-07-03 or later. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like one's user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default output template (`-o \"%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; try to avoid the generic extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to not load config from common locations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38519", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-669 Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/669/Incorrect-Resource-Transfer-Between-Spheres.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-089_youtube-dl/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2024-089: Path traversal in youtube-dl leading to RCE - CVE-2024-38519 | GitHub Security Lab", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j", "ref_desc": "File system modification and RCE through improper file-extension sanitization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2024.07.01", "ref_desc": "Release yt-dlp 2024.07.01 \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/commit/d42a222ed541b96649396ef00e19552aef0f09ec", "ref_desc": "[core,utils] Implement unsafe file extension mitigation \u00b7 ytdl-org/youtube-dl@d42a222 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/5ce582448ececb8d9c30c8c31f58330090ced03a", "ref_desc": "[core] Disallow unsafe extensions (CVE-2024-38519) \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp@5ce5824 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/pull/32830", "ref_desc": "[core] Validate proposed file extensions by dirkf \u00b7 Pull Request #32830 \u00b7 ytdl-org/youtube-dl \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-090_yt-dlp", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2024-090: Path traversal in yt-dlp leading to RCE - CVE-2024-38519 | GitHub Security Lab", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dirkf/youtube-dl/security/advisories/GHSA-22fp-mf44-f2mq", "ref_desc": "File system modification and remote code execution through unchecked file extension \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dirkf/youtube-dl \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
