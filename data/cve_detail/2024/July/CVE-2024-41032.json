{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41032", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: vmalloc: check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask\n\nThe problem is that there are systems where cpu_possible_mask has gaps\nbetween set CPUs, for example SPARC.  In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa()\nhash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not\nsetup CPU area using per_cpu() macro.  This results in an oops on SPARC.\n\nA per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used as hash table, incorrectly\nassuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps.  Fix it by adjusting an index\nto a next possible CPU.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41032", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/28acd531c9a365dac01b32e6bc54aed8c1429bcb", "ref_desc": "mm: vmalloc: check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a34acf30b19bc4ee3ba2f1082756ea2604c19138", "ref_desc": "mm: vmalloc: check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/47f9b6e49b422392fb0e348a65eb925103ba1882", "ref_desc": "mm: vmalloc: check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
