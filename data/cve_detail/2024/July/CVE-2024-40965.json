{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40965", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: lpi2c: Avoid calling clk_get_rate during transfer\n\nInstead of repeatedly calling clk_get_rate for each transfer, lock\nthe clock rate and cache the value.\nA deadlock has been observed while adding tlv320aic32x4 audio codec to\nthe system. When this clock provider adds its clock, the clk mutex is\nlocked already, it needs to access i2c, which in return needs the mutex\nfor clk_get_rate as well.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40965", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.9.7cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-667 Improper Locking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/667/Improper-Locking.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2b42e9587a7a9c7b824e0feb92958f258263963e", "ref_desc": "i2c: lpi2c: Avoid calling clk_get_rate during transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4268254a39484fc11ba991ae148bacbe75d9cc0a", "ref_desc": "i2c: lpi2c: Avoid calling clk_get_rate during transfer - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
