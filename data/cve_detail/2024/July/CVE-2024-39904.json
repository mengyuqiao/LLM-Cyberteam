{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39904", "Description": "VNote is a note-taking platform. Prior to 3.18.1, a code execution vulnerability existed in VNote, which allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary programs on the victim's system. A crafted URI can be used in a note to perform this attack using file:/// as a link. For example, file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary programs by embedding a reference to a local executable file such as file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe and file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/calc.exe. This vulnerability can be exploited by creating and sharing specially crafted notes. An attacker could send a crafted note file and perform further attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.18.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39904", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/73/External-Control-of-File-Name-or-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/commit/3477469b669708ff547037fda9fc2817870428aa", "ref_desc": "check link before open \u00b7 vnotex/vnote@3477469 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/security/advisories/GHSA-vhh5-8wcv-68gj", "ref_desc": "Code Execution Vulnerability via Local File Path Traversal in Vnote \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vnotex/vnote \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
