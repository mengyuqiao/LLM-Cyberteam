{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38353", "Description": "CodiMD allows realtime collaborative markdown notes on all platforms. CodiMD before 2.5.4 is missing authentication and access control vulnerability allowing an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorised access to image data uploaded to CodiMD. CodiMD does not require valid authentication to access uploaded images or to upload new image data. An attacker who can determine an uploaded image's URL can gain unauthorised access to uploaded image data. Due to the insecure random filename generation in the underlying Formidable library, an attacker can determine the filenames for previously uploaded images and the likelihood of this issue being exploited is increased. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38353", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/security/advisories/GHSA-2764-jppc-p2hm", "ref_desc": "CodiMD - Missing Image Access Controls and Unauthorized Image Access \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hackmdio/codimd \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
