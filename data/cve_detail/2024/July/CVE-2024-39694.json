{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39694", "Description": "Duende IdentityServer is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.x framework for ASP.NET Core. It is possible for an attacker to craft malicious Urls that certain functions in IdentityServer will incorrectly treat as local and trusted. If such a Url is returned as a redirect, some browsers will follow it to a third-party, untrusted site. Note: by itself, this vulnerability does **not** allow an attacker to obtain user credentials, authorization codes, access tokens, refresh tokens, or identity tokens. An attacker could however exploit this vulnerability as part of a phishing attack designed to steal user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.6, 6.3.10, 6.2.5, 6.1.8, and 6.0.5. Duende.IdentityServer 5.1 and earlier and all versions of IdentityServer4 are no longer supported and will not be receiving updates. If upgrading is not possible, use `IUrlHelper.IsLocalUrl` from ASP.NET Core to validate return Urls in user interface code in the IdentityServer host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39694", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/commit/269ca2171fe1e901c87f2f0797bbc7c230db87c6", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer@269ca21 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/commit/d0d8eab35ad9183b14925496803ed8b36658d0a1", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer@d0d8eab \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/commit/765116a2d4fb0671b6eba015e698533900c61c8e", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer@765116a \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/security/advisories/GHSA-ff4q-64jc-gx98", "ref_desc": "Open Redirect in IdentityServer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/commit/f04cf0be859b93f43563f8f812eb92206ad94011", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer@f04cf0b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/commit/fe817b499933d6ed6141b153492d7335c28b184a", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer@fe817b4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
