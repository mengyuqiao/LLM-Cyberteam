{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40648", "Description": "matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server library in Rust. The `UserIdentity::is_verified()` method in the matrix-sdk-crypto crate before version 0.7.2 doesn't take into account the verification status of the user's own identity while performing the check and may as a result return a value contrary to what is implied by its name and documentation. If the method is used to decide whether to perform sensitive operations towards a user identity, a malicious homeserver could manipulate the outcome in order to make the identity appear trusted. This is not a typical usage of the method, which lowers the impact. The method itself is not used inside the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate. The 0.7.2 release of the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate includes a fix. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40648", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-4qg4-cvh2-crgg", "ref_desc": "`UserIdentity::is_verified` not checking verification status of own user identity while performing the check \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/76a7052149bb8f722df12da915b3a06d19a6695a", "ref_desc": "crypto: Fix UserIdentity::is_verified to take into account our own id\u2026 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk@76a7052 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
