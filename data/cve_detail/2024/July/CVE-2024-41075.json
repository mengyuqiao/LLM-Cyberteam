{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41075", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread\n\nThis prevents malicious processes from completing random copen/cread\nrequests and crashing the system. Added checks are listed below:\n\n  * Generic, copen can only complete open requests, and cread can only\n    complete read requests.\n  * For copen, ondemand_id must not be 0, because this indicates that the\n    request has not been read by the daemon.\n  * For cread, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the same.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41075", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3b744884c0431b5a62c92900e64bfd0ed61e8e2a", "ref_desc": "cachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36d845ccd7bf527110a65fe953886a176c209539", "ref_desc": "cachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8aaa6c5dd2940ab934d6cd296175f43dbb32b34a", "ref_desc": "cachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a26dc49df37e996876f50a0210039b2d211fdd6f", "ref_desc": "cachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
