This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39918", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/security/advisories/GHSA-vvmv-wrvp-9gjr", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jasonraimondi/url-to-png \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/blob/e43098e0af3a380ebc044e7f303a83933b94b434/src/middlewares/extract_query_params.ts#L75", "ref_desc": "url-to-png/src/middlewares/extract_query_params.ts at e43098e0af3a380ebc044e7f303a83933b94b434 \u00b7 jasonraimondi/url-to-png \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/commit/e4eaeca6493b21cd515b582fd6c0af09ede54507", "ref_desc": "sanitize params \u00b7 jasonraimondi/url-to-png@e4eaeca \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
