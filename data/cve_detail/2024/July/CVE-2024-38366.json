{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38366", "Description": "trunk.cocoapods.org is the authentication server for the CoacoaPods dependency manager. The part of trunk which verifies whether a user has a real email address on signup used a rfc-822 library which executes a shell command to validate the email domain MX records validity. It works via an DNS MX. This lookup could be manipulated to also execute a command on the trunk server, effectively giving root access to the server and the infrastructure. This issue was patched server-side with commit 001cc3a430e75a16307f5fd6cdff1363ad2f40f3 in September 2023. This RCE triggered a full user-session reset, as an attacker could have used this method to write to any Podspec in trunk.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38366", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCocoapods\u00bbCocoapods\u00bbVersion:cpe:2.3:a:cocoapods:cocoapods:0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCocoapods\u00bbTrunk.cocoapods.org\u00bb     RubyEditionVersions  before (<) 2023-09-22cpe:2.3:a:cocoapods:trunk.cocoapods.org:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-19  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://evasec.webflow.io/blog/eva-discovered-supply-chain-vulnerabities-in-cocoapods#2-remote-code-execution-on-the-cocoapods-trunk-server", "ref_desc": "Vulnerabilities in CocoaPods Open the Door to Supply Chain Attacks Against Thousands of iOS and MacOS ApplicationsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/security/advisories/GHSA-x2x4-g675-qg7c", "ref_desc": "Trunk RCE in email verification system rfc-822 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CocoaPods/CocoaPods \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Trunk-RCEs-2023", "ref_desc": "CocoaPods Trunk: 3 Remote Code Execution found, 2023 - CocoaPods BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/X4y9DAynii5xZPyq4RNaceLEBTA.html"}]}
