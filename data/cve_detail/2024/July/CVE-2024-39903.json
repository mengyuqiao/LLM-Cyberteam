{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39903", "Description": "Solara is a pure Python, React-style framework for scaling Jupyter and web apps. A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in widgetti/solara, in version <1.35.1, which was fixed in version 1.35.1. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../' when serving static files. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39903", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;File inclusion", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/widgetti/solara/commit/df2fd66a7f4e8ffd36e8678697a8a4f76760dc54", "ref_desc": "fix: CVE followup, do not serve relative files \u00b7 widgetti/solara@df2fd66 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/widgetti/solara/security/advisories/GHSA-9794-pc4r-438w", "ref_desc": "Local File Inclusion in Solara \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 widgetti/solara \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
