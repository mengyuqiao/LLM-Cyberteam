{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39317", "Description": "Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. A bug in Wagtail's `parse_query_string` would result in it taking a long time to process suitably crafted inputs. When used to parse sufficiently long strings of characters without a space, `parse_query_string` would take an unexpectedly large amount of time to process, resulting in a denial of service. In an initial Wagtail installation, the vulnerability can be exploited by any Wagtail admin user. It cannot be exploited by end users. If your Wagtail site has a custom search implementation which uses `parse_query_string`, it may be exploitable by other users (e.g. unauthenticated users). Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 5.2.6, 6.0.6 and 6.1.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39317", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.0.6cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 6.1andbefore (<) 6.1.3cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 2.0andbefore (<) 5.2.6cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWagtail\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 6.1andbefore (<) 6.1.3cpe:2.3:a:wagtail:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWagtail\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.0.6cpe:2.3:a:wagtail:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWagtail\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 2.0andbefore (<) 5.2.6cpe:2.3:a:wagtail:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/31b1e8532dfb1b70d8d37d22aff9cbde9109cdf2", "ref_desc": "Require word boundaries before search query filters (CVE-2024-39317) \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@31b1e85 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/3c941136f79c48446e3858df46e5b668d7f83797", "ref_desc": "Require word boundaries before search query filters (CVE-2024-39317) \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@3c94113 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/b783c096b6d4fd2cfc05f9137a0be288850e99a2", "ref_desc": "Require word boundaries before search query filters (CVE-2024-39317) \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@b783c09 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-jmp3-39vp-fwg8", "ref_desc": "Regular expression denial-of-service via search query parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
