While the former is unlikely, the latter\nis valid (future) use case and will cause NPD when someone will\ntry to dump PAT settings by debugfs.\n\nIt's better to check pointer to pat.ops instead of specific .dump\nhook, as we have this hook always defined for every .ops variant.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42091", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a918e771e6fbe1fa68932af5b0cdf473e23090cc", "ref_desc": "drm/xe: Check pat.ops before dumping PAT settings - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/583ce246c7ff9edeb0de49130cdc3d45db8545cb", "ref_desc": "drm/xe: Check pat.ops before dumping PAT settings - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
