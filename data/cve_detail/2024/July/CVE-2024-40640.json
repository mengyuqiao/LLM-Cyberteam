{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40640", "Description": "vodozemac is an open source implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust.  Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel attack. The use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material. The impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements, as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes.  Additionally, the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the referenced paper. This has been patched in commit 734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272 which has been included in release version 0.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40640", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04600", "ref_desc": "[2108.04600] Util::Lookup: Exploiting key decoding in cryptographic libraries", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/security/advisories/GHSA-j8cm-g7r6-hfpq", "ref_desc": "Usage of non-constant time base64 decoder could lead to leakage of secret key material \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/vodozemac \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/commit/734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272", "ref_desc": "fix: Use a constant-time Base64 encoder for secret key material \u00b7 matrix-org/vodozemac@734b6c6 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
