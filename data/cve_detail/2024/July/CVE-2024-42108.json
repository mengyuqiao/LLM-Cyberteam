{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42108", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: rswitch: Avoid use-after-free in rswitch_poll()\n\nThe use-after-free is actually in rswitch_tx_free(), which is inlined in\nrswitch_poll(). Since `skb` and `gq->skbs[gq->dirty]` are in fact the\nsame pointer, the skb is first freed using dev_kfree_skb_any(), then the\nvalue in skb->len is used to update the interface statistics.\n\nLet's move around the instructions to use skb->len before the skb is\nfreed.\n\nThis bug is trivial to reproduce using KFENCE. It will trigger a splat\nevery few packets. A simple ARP request or ICMP echo request is enough.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42108", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.8andbefore (<) 6.9.9cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/92cbbe7759193e3418f38d0d73f8fe125312c58b", "ref_desc": "net: rswitch: Avoid use-after-free in rswitch_poll() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a0c28efeec6383ef22e97437616b920e7320b67", "ref_desc": "net: rswitch: Avoid use-after-free in rswitch_poll() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
