{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39555", "Description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nUpon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:\n\nBGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)\n\nOnly systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.\n\nThis issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2.\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO, \n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S1-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R1-S2-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39555", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA83015", "ref_desc": "Article Detail", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
