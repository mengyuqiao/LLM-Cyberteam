{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39700", "Description": "JupyterLab extension template is a  `copier` template for JupyterLab extensions. Repositories created using this template with `test` option include `update-integration-tests.yml` workflow which has an RCE vulnerability. Extension authors hosting their code on GitHub are urged to upgrade the template to the latest version. Users who made changes to `update-integration-tests.yml`, accept overwriting of this file and re-apply your changes later. Users may wish to temporarily disable GitHub Actions while working on the upgrade. We recommend rebasing all open pull requests from untrusted users as actions may run using the version from the `main` branch at the time when the pull request was created. Users who are upgrading from template version prior to 4.3.0 may wish to leave out proposed changes to the release workflow for now as it requires additional configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39700", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-template/security/advisories/GHSA-45gq-v5wm-82wg", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution vulnerability in `update-integration-tests` GitHub Action workflow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterlab/extension-template \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-template/commit/035e78c1c65bcedee97c95bb683abe59c96bc4e6", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-45gq-v5wm-82wg \u00b7 jupyterlab/extension-template@035e78c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
