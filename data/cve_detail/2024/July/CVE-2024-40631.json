{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40631", "Description": "Plate media is an open source, rich-text editor for React. Editors that use `MediaEmbedElement` and pass custom `urlParsers` to the `useMediaState` hook may be vulnerable to XSS if a custom parser allows `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be embedded. Editors that do not use `urlParsers` and consume the `url` property directly may also be vulnerable if the URL is not sanitised. The default parsers `parseTwitterUrl` and `parseVideoUrl` are not affected. `@udecode/plate-media` 36.0.10 resolves this issue by only allowing HTTP and HTTPS URLs during parsing. This affects only the `embed` property returned from `useMediaState`. In addition, the `url` property returned from `useMediaState` has been renamed to `unsafeUrl` to indicate that it has not been sanitised. The `url` property on `element` is also unsafe, but has not been renamed. If you're using either of these properties directly, you will still need to validate the URL yourself. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any custom `urlParsers` do not allow `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be returned in the `url` property of their return values. If `url` is consumed directly, validate the URL protocol before passing it to the `iframe` element.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40631", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/udecode/plate/commit/1bc0971774fbfb770780c9bdb94746a6f0f196a0", "ref_desc": "Harden media embed element against XSS \u00b7 udecode/plate@1bc0971 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/udecode/plate/security/advisories/GHSA-h3pq-667x-r789", "ref_desc": "XSS in media embed element when using custom URL parsers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 udecode/plate \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://stackoverflow.com/a/43467144", "ref_desc": "Check if a JavaScript string is a URL - Stack Overflow", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
