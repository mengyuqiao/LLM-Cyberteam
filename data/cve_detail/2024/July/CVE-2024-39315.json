{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39315", "Description": "Pomerium is an identity and context-aware access proxy. Prior to version 0.26.1, the Pomerium user info page (at `/.pomerium`) unintentionally included serialized OAuth2 access and ID tokens from the logged-in user's session. These tokens are not intended to be exposed to end users. This issue may be more severe in the presence of a cross-site scripting vulnerability in an upstream application proxied through Pomerium. If an attacker could insert a malicious script onto a web page proxied through Pomerium, that script could access these tokens by making a request to the `/.pomerium` endpoint. Upstream applications that authenticate only the ID token may be vulnerable to user impersonation using a token obtained in this manner. Note that an OAuth2 access token or ID token by itself is not sufficient to hijack a user's Pomerium session. Upstream applications should not be vulnerable to user impersonation via these tokens provided the application verifies the Pomerium JWT for each request, the connection between Pomerium and the application is secured by mTLS, or the connection between Pomerium and the application is otherwise secured at the network layer. The issue is patched in Pomerium v0.26.1. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39315", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/201/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-Into-Sent-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/commit/4c7c4320afb2ced70ba19b46de1ac4383f3daa48", "ref_desc": "core/userinfo: remove excess userinfo data (#5148) \u00b7 pomerium/pomerium@4c7c432 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/security/advisories/GHSA-rrqr-7w59-637v", "ref_desc": "OAuth2 access and ID tokens exposed in user info endpoint response \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pomerium/pomerium \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
