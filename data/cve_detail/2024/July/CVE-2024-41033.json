{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41033", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncachestat: do not flush stats in recency check\n\nsyzbot detects that cachestat() is flushing stats, which can sleep, in its\nRCU read section (see [1]).  This is done in the workingset_test_recent()\nstep (which checks if the folio's eviction is recent).\n\nMove the stat flushing step to before the RCU read section of cachestat,\nand skip stat flushing during the recency check.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/cgroups/000000000000f71227061bdf97e0@google.com/", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41033", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d1ba14e00d290b1ed616ed78c8c49bf897ce390", "ref_desc": "cachestat: do not flush stats in recency check - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5a4d8944d6b1e1aaaa83ea42c116b520b4ed0394", "ref_desc": "cachestat: do not flush stats in recency check - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
