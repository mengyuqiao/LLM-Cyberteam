{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40624", "Description": "TorrentPier is an open source BitTorrent Public/Private tracker engine, written in php. In `torrentpier/library/includes/functions.php`, `get_tracks()` uses the unsafe native PHP serialization format to deserialize user-controlled cookies. One can use phpggc and the chain Guzzle/FW1 to write PHP code to an arbitrary file, and execute commands on the system. For instance, the cookie bb_t will be deserialized when browsing to viewforum.php. This issue has been addressed in commit `ed37e6e52` which is expected to be included in release version 2.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the new release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40624", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/blob/84f6c9f4a081d9ffff4c233098758280304bf50f/library/includes/functions.php#L41-L60", "ref_desc": "torrentpier/library/includes/functions.php at 84f6c9f4a081d9ffff4c233098758280304bf50f \u00b7 torrentpier/torrentpier \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/commit/ed37e6e522f345f2b46147c6f53c1ab6dec1db9e", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 torrentpier/torrentpier@ed37e6e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/security/advisories/GHSA-fg86-4c2r-7wxw", "ref_desc": "Deserialization of untrusted data in torrentpier/torrentpier \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 torrentpier/torrentpier \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
