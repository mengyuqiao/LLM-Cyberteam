{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39316", "Description": "Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Starting in version 3.1.0 and prior to version 3.1.5, Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the `Rack::Request::Helpers` module when parsing HTTP Accept headers. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker sending specially crafted `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` headers, causing the server to spend excessive time processing the request and leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). The fix for CVE-2024-26146 was not applied to the main branch and thus while the issue was fixed for the Rack v3.0 release series, it was not fixed in the v3.1 release series until v3.1.5. Users of versions on the 3.1 branch should upgrade to version 3.1.5 to receive the fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39316", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-54rr-7fvw-6x8f", "ref_desc": "Possible Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack Header Parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rack/rack \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_mbFlsnndh5JvAgA2QqjcrR6F5E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/412c980450ca729ee37f90a2661f166a9665e058", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-cj83-2ww7-mvq7 \u00b7 rack/rack@412c980 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-cj83-2ww7-mvq7", "ref_desc": "ReDoS Vulnerability in HTTP Accept Headers Parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rack/rack \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
