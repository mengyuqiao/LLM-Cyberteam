{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41668", "Description": "The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets. When running a publicly exposed proxy endpoint without authentication, cBioPortal could allow someone to perform a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. Logged in users could do the same on private instances. A fix has been released in version 6.0.12. As a workaround, one might be able to disable `/proxy` endpoint entirely via, for example, nginx.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41668", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/pull/10884", "ref_desc": "Restrict proxy access to known hosts only by onursumer \u00b7 Pull Request #10884 \u00b7 cBioPortal/cbioportal \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/releases/tag/v6.0.12", "ref_desc": "Release v6.0.12 \u00b7 cBioPortal/cbioportal \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/security-research-advisories/vuln/WLX-2024-004", "ref_desc": "wizlynx group | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in cBioPortal v6.0.8 and below", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/security/advisories/GHSA-9h44-r3c3-q7rm", "ref_desc": "Proxy Endpoint Vulnerabliity \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cBioPortal/cbioportal \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/commit/ea8642fdbda2d61d2ab34b9da7a1594680bbbcd5", "ref_desc": "Restrict proxy access to known hosts only (#10884) \u00b7 cBioPortal/cbioportal@ea8642f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
