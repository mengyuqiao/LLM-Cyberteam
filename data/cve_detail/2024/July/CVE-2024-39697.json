{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39697", "Description": "phonenumber is a library for parsing, formatting and validating international phone numbers. Since 0.3.4, the phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a panic-guarded out-of-bounds access on the phonenumber string. In a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, where the \"number\" part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.6.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39697", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-392 Missing Report of Error Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/392/Missing-Report-of-Error-Condition.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/issues/69", "ref_desc": "[bug]: Donot use `assert!` in NationalNumber::new function \u00b7 Issue #69 \u00b7 whisperfish/rust-phonenumber \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/security/advisories/GHSA-mjw4-jj88-v687", "ref_desc": "panic on parsing crafted phonenumber inputs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 whisperfish/rust-phonenumber \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/f69abee1481fac0d6d531407bae90020e39c6407", "ref_desc": "Fit NationalNumber in 64 bits \u00b7 whisperfish/rust-phonenumber@f69abee \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/b792151b17fc90231c232a23935830c2266f3203", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'proptest' for CVE-2024-39697 \u00b7 whisperfish/rust-phonenumber@b792151 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/pull/52", "ref_desc": "Fit NationalNumber in 64 bits by rubdos \u00b7 Pull Request #52 \u00b7 whisperfish/rust-phonenumber \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
