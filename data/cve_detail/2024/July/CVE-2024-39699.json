{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39699", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39699", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nMonospace\u00bbDirectus\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 10.9.3cpe:2.3:a:monospace:directus:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nMonospace\u00bbDirectusVersions  before (<) 10.9.3cpe:2.3:a:monospace:directus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/d577b44231c0923aca99cac5770fd853801caee1", "ref_desc": "Add validation for IP Access in Role settings (#21444) \u00b7 directus/directus@d577b44 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-8p72-rcq4-h6pw", "ref_desc": "Blind SSRF On File Import \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
