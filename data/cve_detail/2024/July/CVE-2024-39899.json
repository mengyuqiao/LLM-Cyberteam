{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39899", "Description": "PrivateBin is an online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data. In v1.5, PrivateBin introduced the YOURLS server-side proxy. The idea was to allow using the YOURLs URL shortener without running the YOURLs instance without authentication and/or exposing the authentication token to the public, allowing anyone to shorten any URL. With the proxy mechanism, anyone can shorten any URL pointing to the configured PrivateBin instance. The vulnerability allowed other URLs to be shortened, as long as they contain the PrivateBin instance, defeating the limit imposed by the proxy. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39899", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-305 Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/305/Authentication-Bypass-by-Primary-Weakness.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-791 Incomplete Filtering of Special Elements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/791/Incomplete-Filtering-of-Special-Elements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/security/advisories/GHSA-mqqj-fx8h-437j", "ref_desc": "Bypass of YOURLS proxy URL filter allows shortening URLs via YOURLs for other domains rather than the PrivateBin instance \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrivateBin/PrivateBin \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/commit/0c4e810e6728f67d678458838d8430dfba4fcca4", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'shorten-non-self-url' \u00b7 PrivateBin/PrivateBin@0c4e810 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/pull/1370", "ref_desc": "prevent bypassing YOURLS proxy URL filter by elrido \u00b7 Pull Request #1370 \u00b7 PrivateBin/PrivateBin \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
