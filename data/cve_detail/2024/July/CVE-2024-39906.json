{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39906", "Description": "A command injection vulnerability was found in the IndieAuth functionality of the Ruby on Rails based Haven blog web application. The affected functionality requires authentication, but an attacker can craft a link that they can pass to a logged in administrator of the blog software. This leads to the immediate execution of the provided commands when the link is accessed by the authenticated administrator. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and has been addressed by commit `c52f07c`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39906", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/havenweb/haven/security/advisories/GHSA-65cm-7g24-hm9f", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution in IndieAuthClient (GHSL-2024-093) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 havenweb/haven \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/havenweb/haven/commit/c52f07c", "ref_desc": "add URI validation to indieauth flow \u00b7 havenweb/haven@c52f07c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
