{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39887", "Description": "An SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache Superset exists due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions: version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.0.2.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39887", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/16/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2024-39887: Apache Superset: Improper SQL authorisation, parse not checking for specific engine functions", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/j55vm41jg3l0x6w49zrmvbf3k0ts5fqz", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-39887: Apache Superset: Improper SQL authorisation, parse not checking for specific engine functions-Apache Mail Archives", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
