{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39326", "Description": "SkillTree is a micro-learning gamification platform. Prior to version 2.12.6, the endpoint \n`/admin/projects/{projectname}/skills/{skillname}/video` (and probably others) is open to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Due to the endpoint being CSRFable e.g POST request, supports a content type that can be exploited (multipart file upload), makes a state change and has no CSRF mitigations in place (samesite flag, CSRF token). It is possible to perform a CSRF attack against a logged in admin account, allowing an attacker that can target a logged in admin of Skills Service to modify the videos, captions, and text of the skill. Version 2.12.6 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39326", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/security/advisories/GHSA-9624-qwxr-jr4j", "ref_desc": "CSRF Vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the Video and Captions of a Skill \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/blob/24dd22f43306fc616e4580fb8bb88f66b5d9b41d/service/src/main/java/skills/controller/AdminController.groovy#L574", "ref_desc": "skills-service/service/src/main/java/skills/controller/AdminController.groovy at 24dd22f43306fc616e4580fb8bb88f66b5d9b41d \u00b7 NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/commit/68d4235ddcb16e4f33fc7f19d14ff917817a366c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2600 from NationalSecurityAgency/csrf_fix \u00b7 NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service@68d4235 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
