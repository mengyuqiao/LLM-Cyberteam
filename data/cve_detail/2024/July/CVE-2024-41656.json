{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41656", "Description": "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version 10.0.0 and prior to version 24.7.1, an unsanitized payload sent by an Integration platform integration allows storing arbitrary HTML tags on the Sentry side with the subsequent rendering them on the Issues page. Self-hosted Sentry users may be impacted in case of untrustworthy Integration platform integrations sending external issues from their side to Sentry. A patch has been released in Sentry 24.7.1. For Sentry SaaS customers, no action is needed. This has been patched on July 23, and even prior to the fix, the exploitation was not possible due to the strict Content Security Policy deployed on sentry.io site. For self-hosted users, the maintainers of Sentry strongly recommend upgrading Sentry to the latest version. If it is not possible, one could enable CSP on one's self-hosted installation with `CSP_REPORT_ONLY = False` (enforcing mode). This will mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41656", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/5c679521f1539eabfb81287bfc30f34dbecd373e", "ref_desc": "fix(issues): structured issue annotations (#74648) \u00b7 getsentry/sentry@5c67952 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/74648", "ref_desc": "fix(issues): structured issue annotations by oioki \u00b7 Pull Request #74648 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/24.7.1", "ref_desc": "Release 24.7.1 \u00b7 getsentry/self-hosted \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-fm88-hc3v-3www", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via integration external issues \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
