{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39920", "Description": "The TCP protocol in RFC 9293 has a timing side channel that makes it easier for remote attackers to infer the content of one TCP connection from a client system (to any server), when that client system is concurrently obtaining TCP data at a slow rate from an attacker-controlled server, aka the \"SnailLoad\" issue. For example, the attack can begin by measuring RTTs via the TCP segments whose role is to provide an ACK control bit and an Acknowledgment Number.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39920", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1255 Comparison Logic is Vulnerable to Power Side-Channel Attacks", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1255/Comparison-Logic-is-Vulnerable-to-Power-Side-Channel-Attacks.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/IAIK/SnailLoad", "ref_desc": "GitHub - IAIK/SnailLoad", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9293.txt", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.snailload.com", "ref_desc": "SnailLoad: Exploiting Remote Network Latency Measurements without JavaScript", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C8wpO1UtExw/", "ref_desc": "Login \u2022 Instagram", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/tugraz/status/1805272833322299412", "ref_desc": "TU Graz on X: \"\ud83d\udea8\u203c\ufe0f New security loophole allows spying on internet users visiting websites and watching videos \u203c\ufe0f\ud83d\udea8 The security loophole known as \"SnailLoad\" allows bypassing firewalls, VPN connecti", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.snailload.com/snailload.pdf", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.tugraz.at/en/tu-graz/services/news-stories/tu-graz-news/singleview/article/neue-sicherheitsluecke-erlaubt-ueberwachung-besuchter-websites-und-angesehener-videos", "ref_desc": "New Security Loophole Allows Spying on Internet Users Visiting Websites and Watching Videos", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40809629", "ref_desc": "SnailLoad \u2013 Remote Network Latency Measurements Leak User Activity | Hacker News", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
