{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40430", "Description": "In SFTPGO 2.6.2, the JWT implementation lacks certain security measures, such as using JWT ID (JTI) claims, nonces, and proper expiration and invalidation mechanisms. NOTE: The vendor argues that the prerequisite for this exploit is to be able to steal another user's cookie. Additionally, it is argued that SFTPGo validates cookies being used by the IP address it was issued to, so stolen cookies from different IP addresses will not work.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40430", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSftpgo Project\u00bbSftpgo\u00bbVersion:2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:sftpgo_project:sftpgo:2.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSftpgo Project\u00bbSftpgo\u00bbVersion:2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:sftpgo_project:sftpgo:2.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-14  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-07-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/4645", "ref_desc": "[GHSA-x72p-g37q-4xr9] SFTPGo's JWT implmentation lacks certain security measures by drakkan \u00b7 Pull Request #4645 \u00b7 github/advisory-database \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://alexsecurity.rocks/posts/cve-2024-40430/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-40430 - Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Vulnerability Exploiting JWT Replay in SFTPGO | Alex RodriguezExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
