{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41806", "Description": "The Open edX Platform is a learning management platform. Instructors can upload csv files containing learner information to create cohorts in the instructor dashboard. These files are uploaded using the django default storage. With certain storage backends, uploads may become publicly available when the uploader uses versions master, palm, olive, nutmeg, maple, lilac, koa, or juniper. The patch in commit cb729a3ced0404736dfa0ae768526c82b608657b ensures that cohorts data uploaded to AWS S3 buckets is written with a private ACL. Beyond patching, deployers should also ensure that existing cohorts uploads have a private ACL, or that other precautions are taken to avoid public access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41806", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/commit/cb729a3ced0404736dfa0ae768526c82b608657b", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 openedx/edx-platform@cb729a3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-4528-7fh6-x75c", "ref_desc": "Instructor upload CSV for cohort creation not Private by Default \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openedx/edx-platform \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
