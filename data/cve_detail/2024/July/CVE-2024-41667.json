{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41667", "Description": "OpenAM is an open access management solution. In versions 15.0.3 and prior, the `getCustomLoginUrlTemplate` method in RealmOAuth2ProviderSettings.java is vulnerable to template injection due to its usage of user input. Although the developer intended to implement a custom URL for handling login to override the default OpenAM login, they did not restrict the `CustomLoginUrlTemplate`, allowing it to be set freely. Commit fcb8432aa77d5b2e147624fe954cb150c568e0b8 introduces `TemplateClassResolver.SAFER_RESOLVER` to disable the resolution of commonly exploited classes in FreeMarker template injection. As of time of publication, this fix is expected to be part of version 15.0.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41667", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-11  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/security/advisories/GHSA-7726-43hg-m23v", "ref_desc": "OpenAM FreeMarker template injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/commit/fcb8432aa77d5b2e147624fe954cb150c568e0b8", "ref_desc": "FIX GHSA-7726-43hg-m23v disable the resolution of commonly exploited\u2026 \u00b7 OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM@fcb8432 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
