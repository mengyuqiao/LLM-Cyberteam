{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-40919", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnxt_en: Adjust logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send()\n\nIn case of token is released due to token->state == BNXT_HWRM_DEFERRED,\nreleased token (set to NULL) is used in log messages. This issue is\nexpected to be prevented by HWRM_ERR_CODE_PF_UNAVAILABLE error code. But\nthis error code is returned by recent firmware. So some firmware may not\nreturn it. This may lead to NULL pointer dereference.\nAdjust this issue by adding token pointer check.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40919", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cde177fa235cd36f981012504a6376315bac03c9", "ref_desc": "bnxt_en: Adjust logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a9b9741854a9fe9df948af49ca5514e0ed0429df", "ref_desc": "bnxt_en: Adjust logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b65eaeae88d4e9f999e806e196dd887b90bfed9", "ref_desc": "bnxt_en: Adjust logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ca6660c956242623b4cfe9be2a1abc67907c44bf", "ref_desc": "bnxt_en: Adjust logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send() - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
