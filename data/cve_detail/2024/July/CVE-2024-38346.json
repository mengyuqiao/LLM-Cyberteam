{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-38346", "Description": "The CloudStack cluster service runs on unauthenticated port (default 9090) that can be misused to run arbitrary commands on targeted hypervisors and CloudStack management server hosts. Some of these commands were found to have command injection vulnerabilities that can result in arbitrary code execution via agents on the hosts that may run as a privileged user.\u00a0An attacker that can reach the cluster service on the unauthenticated\u00a0port (default 9090), can exploit this to perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete\u00a0compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure.\n\nUsers are recommended to restrict the network access to the cluster service port (default 9090) on a CloudStack management server host to only its peer CloudStack management server hosts.\u00a0Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38346", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCloudstackVersions  from including (>=) 4.19.0.0andbefore (<) 4.19.0.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:cloudstack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbCloudstackVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.18.2.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:cloudstack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-09  0.05%  0.19%  +0.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.shapeblue.com/shapeblue-security-advisory-apache-cloudstack-security-releases-4-18-2-1-and-4-19-0-2/", "ref_desc": "ShapeBlue Security Advisory: Apache CloudStack Security Releases 4.18.2.1 and 4.19.0.2 - ShapeBlueRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hbgG_3_3nBZZv0UhQE8JtO5BDWc.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/05/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [ANNOUNCE] Apache CloudStack LTS Security Releases 4.18.2.1 and 4.19.0.2Mailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jDucPvE_pTUctj8yJDVY4V6hBVE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://cloudstack.apache.org/blog/security-release-advisory-4.19.0.2-4.18.2.1", "ref_desc": "[ADVISORY] Apache CloudStack LTS Security Releases 4.18.2.1 and 4.19.0.2 | Apache CloudStackRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/t75XGTr8nSCktD1reCr0-jaUQj0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/6l51r00csrct61plkyd3qg3fj99215d1", "ref_desc": "[ANNOUNCE] Apache CloudStack LTS Security Releases 4.18.2.1 and 4.19.0.2-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TMNYBwa2hVFx1u_CpOlrRIdxT1I.html"}]}
