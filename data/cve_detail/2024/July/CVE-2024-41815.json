{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41815", "Description": "Starship is a cross-shell prompt. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 1.20.0, undocumented and unpredictable shell expansion and/or quoting rules make it easily to accidentally cause shell injection when using custom commands with starship in bash. This issue only affects users with custom commands, so the scope is limited, and without knowledge of others' commands, it could be hard to successfully target someone. Version 1.20.0 fixes the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41815", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nStarship\u00bbStarshipVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.20.0cpe:2.3:a:starship:starship:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nStarship\u00bbStarshipVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.20.0cpe:2.3:a:starship:starship:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-20  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/starship/starship/security/advisories/GHSA-vx24-x4mv-vwr5", "ref_desc": "Undocumented and unpredictable shell expansion in custom commands can lead to shell injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 starship/starship \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/starship/starship/releases/tag/v1.20.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.20.0 \u00b7 starship/starship \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/starship/starship/commit/cfc58161e0ec595db90af686ad77a73df6d44d74", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 starship/starship@cfc5816 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
