{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42147", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue\n\nDuring the zip probe process, the debugfs failure does not stop\nthe probe. When debugfs initialization fails, jumping to the\nerror branch will also release regs, in addition to its own\nrollback operation.\n\nAs a result, it may be released repeatedly during the regs\nuninit process. Therefore, the null check needs to be added to\nthe regs uninit process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42147", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e0a2d2df9ba7bd6bd7e0a9b6a5e3894f7e8445b3", "ref_desc": "crypto: hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7fc8d9a525b5c3f8dfa5ed50901e764d8ede7e1e", "ref_desc": "crypto: hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eda60520cfe3aba9f088c68ebd5bcbca9fc6ac3c", "ref_desc": "crypto: hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8be0913389718e8d27c4f1d4537b5e1b99ed7739", "ref_desc": "crypto: hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
