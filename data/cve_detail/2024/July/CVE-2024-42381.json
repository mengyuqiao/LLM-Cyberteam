{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42381", "Description": "os/linux/elf.rb in Homebrew brew before 4.2.20 uses ldd to load ELF files obtained from untrusted sources, which allows attackers to achieve code execution via an ELF file with a custom .interp section. NOTE: this code execution would occur during an un-sandboxed binary relocation phase, which occurs before a user would expect execution of downloaded package content. (237d1e783f7ee261beaba7d3f6bde22da7148b0a was the tested vulnerable version.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42381", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-830 Inclusion of Web Functionality from an Untrusted Source", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/830/Inclusion-of-Web-Functionality-from-an-Untrusted-Source.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/commit/916b37388d3851a8a93a8e9b4adc38873680ead7", "ref_desc": "Revert \"Revert \"os/linux/elf: avoid using ldd for listing dynamic dep\u2026 \u00b7 Homebrew/brew@916b373 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/tag/4.2.20", "ref_desc": "Release 4.2.20 \u00b7 Homebrew/brew \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-08-28-homebrew-securityreview.pdf", "ref_desc": "publications/reviews/2023-08-28-homebrew-securityreview.pdf at master \u00b7 trailofbits/publications \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tree/237d1e783f7ee261beaba7d3f6bde22da7148b0a", "ref_desc": "GitHub - Homebrew/brew at 237d1e783f7ee261beaba7d3f6bde22da7148b0a", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/17136", "ref_desc": "Revert \"Revert \"os/linux/elf: avoid using ldd for listing dynamic dependencies\"\" by ZhongRuoyu \u00b7 Pull Request #17136 \u00b7 Homebrew/brew \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://brew.sh/2024/07/30/homebrew-security-audit/", "ref_desc": "2023 Security Audit \u2014 Homebrew", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/07/30/our-audit-of-homebrew/", "ref_desc": "Our audit of Homebrew | Trail of Bits Blog", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
