{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39318", "Description": "The Ibexa Admin UI Bundle contains all the necessary parts to run the Ibexa DXP Back Office interface. The file upload widget is vulnerable to XSS payloads in filenames. Access permission to upload files is required. As such, in most cases only authenticated editors and administrators will have the required permission. It is not persistent, i.e. the payload is only executed during the upload. In effect, an attacker will have to trick an editor/administrator into uploading a strangely named file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39318", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ibexa/admin-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-qm44-wjm2-pr59", "ref_desc": "DOM-based XSS in file upload widget \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ibexa/admin-ui \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ibexa/admin-ui/commit/8dc413fad1045fcfbe65dbcb0bea8516accc4c3e", "ref_desc": "Merge branch '2.3' of ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui into 4.6 (#1311) \u00b7 ibexa/admin-ui@8dc413f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developers.ibexa.co/security-advisories/ibexa-sa-2024-004-dom-based-xss-in-file-upload", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory IBEXA-SA-2024-004: DOM-based XSS in file upload", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui/commit/7a9f991b200fa5a03d49cd07f50577c8bc90a30b", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui@7a9f991 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-gc5h-6jx9-q2qh", "ref_desc": "DOM-based XSS in file upload widget \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
