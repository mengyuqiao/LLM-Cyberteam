{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39345", "Description": "AdTran 834-5 HDC17600021F1 (SmartOS 11.1.1.1) devices enable the SSH service by default and have a hidden, undocumented, hard-coded support account whose password is based on the devices MAC address. All of the devices internet interfaces share a similar MAC address that only varies in their final octet. This allows network-adjacent attackers to derive the support user's SSH password by decrementing the final octet of the connected gateway address or via the BSSID. An attacker can then execute arbitrary OS commands with root-level privileges. NOTE: The vendor states that there is no intended functionality allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary OS Commands with root-level privileges. The vendor also states that this issue was fixed in SmartOS 12.5.5.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39345", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAdtran\u00bbSdg SmartosVersions  before (<) 12.1.3.1cpe:2.3:o:adtran:sdg_smartos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Adtran\u00bb834-5\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-259 Use of Hard-coded Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/259/Use-of-Hard-coded-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/AdTran/CVE-2024-39345", "ref_desc": "cve/AdTran/CVE-2024-39345 at main \u00b7 actuator/cve \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://supportcommunity.adtran.com/t5/Security-Advisories/ADTSA-2024001-Multiple-vulnerabilities-in-Service-Delivery-Gateway-products/ta-p/39332", "ref_desc": "My Adtran Log InCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MN75vCKeeh7VQRxl3qlqAj_IGjQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/AdTran/TBA", "ref_desc": "cve/AdTran/TBA at main \u00b7 actuator/cve \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
