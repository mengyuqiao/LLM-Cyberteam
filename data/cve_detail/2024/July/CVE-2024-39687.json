{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39687", "Description": "Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub and other standards. At present, when Fedify needs to retrieve an object or activity from a remote activitypub server, it makes a HTTP request to the `@id` or other resources present within the activity it has received from the web. This activity could reference an `@id` that points to an internal IP address, allowing an attacker to send request to resources internal to the fedify server's network. This applies to not just resolution of documents containing activities or objects, but also to media URLs as well. Specifically this is a Server Side Request Forgery attack. Users should upgrade to Fedify version 0.9.2, 0.10.1, or 0.11.1 to receive a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39687", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/commit/30f9cf4a175704a04c874f3ea88414c5f1e00b28", "ref_desc": "Fix SSRF vulnerability in document loader \u00b7 dahlia/fedify@30f9cf4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/security/advisories/GHSA-p9cg-vqcc-grcx", "ref_desc": "Potential for access to internal network resources \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dahlia/fedify \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/commit/c641e976089dd913f649889c1bfb016df04e86ba", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-p9cg-vqcc-grcx \u00b7 dahlia/fedify@c641e97 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
