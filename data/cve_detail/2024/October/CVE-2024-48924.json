{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-48924", "Description": "### Impact\n\nWhen this library is used to deserialize messagepack data from an untrusted source, there is a risk of a denial of service attack by an attacker that sends data contrived to produce hash collisions, leading to large CPU consumption disproportionate to the size of the data being deserialized.\n\nThis is similar to [a prior advisory](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf), which provided an inadequate fix for the hash collision part of the vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe following steps are required to mitigate this risk.\n\n1. Upgrade to a version of the library where a fix is available.\n1. Review the steps in [this previous advisory](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) to ensure you have your application configured for untrusted data.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading MessagePack to a patched version is not an option for you, you may apply a manual workaround as follows:\n\n1. Declare a class that derives from `MessagePackSecurity`.\n2. Override the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>` method to provide a collision-resistant hash function of your own and avoid calling `base.GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>()`.\n3. Configure a `MessagePackSerializerOptions` with an instance of your derived type by calling `WithSecurity` on an existing options object.\n4. Use your custom options object for all deserialization operations. This may be by setting the `MessagePackSerializer.DefaultOptions` static property, if you call methods that rely on this default property, and/or by passing in the options object explicitly to any `Deserialize` method.\n\n### References\n\n- Learn more about best security practices when reading untrusted data with [MessagePack 1.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/tree/v1.x#security) or [MessagePack 2.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp#security).\n- The .NET team's [discussion on hash collision vulnerabilities of their `HashCode` struct](https://github.com/GrabYourPitchforks/runtime/blob/threat_models/docs/design/security/System.HashCode.md).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Start a public discussion](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/discussions)\n* [Email us privately](mailto:andrewarnott@live.com)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48924", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-328 Use of Weak Hash", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/328/Use-of-Weak-Hash.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/commit/f8d40b3ad0be01c6e56cb51ecea81f59d98c192d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2014 from MessagePack-CSharp/secureHash \u00b7 MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp@f8d40b3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-4qm4-8hg2-g2xm", "ref_desc": "Untrusted data can lead to DoS attack due to hash collisions and stack overflow, round 2 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/commit/8e599af0798b45008f8b293a7f233e4878f11ed5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2015 from MessagePack-CSharp/secureHash_v3 \u00b7 MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp@8e599af \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
