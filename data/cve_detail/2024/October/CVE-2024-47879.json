{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47879", "Description": "OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, lack of cross-site request forgery protection on the `preview-expression` command means that visiting a malicious website could cause an attacker-controlled expression to be executed. The expression can contain arbitrary Clojure or Python code. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row, and the attacker must convince the victim to open a malicious webpage. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47879", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-3jm4-c6qf-jrh3", "ref_desc": "PreviewExpressionCommand, which is eval, lacks protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/090924ca923489b6c94397cf1f5df7f7f78f0126", "ref_desc": "Add CSRF protection to commands that evaluate expressions \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine@090924c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
