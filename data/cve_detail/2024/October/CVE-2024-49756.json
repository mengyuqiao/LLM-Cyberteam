{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49756", "Description": "AshPostgres is the PostgreSQL data layer for Ash Framework. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.10, in certain very specific situations, it was possible for the policies of an update action to be skipped. This occurred only on \"empty\" update actions (no changing fields), and would allow their hooks (side effects) to be performed when they should not have been. Note that this does not allow reading new data that the user should not have had access to, only triggering a side effect a user should not have been able to trigger.\n\nTo be vulnerable, an affected user must have an update action that is on a resource with no attributes containing an \"update default\" (updated_at timestamp, for example); can be performed atomically; does not have `require_atomic? false`; has at least one authorizer (typically `Ash.Policy.Authorizer`); and has at least one `change` (on the resource's `changes` block or in the action itself). This is where the side-effects would be performed when they should not have been.\n\nThis problem has been patched in `2.4.10` of `ash_postgres`. Several workarounds are available. Potentially affected users may determine that none of their actions are vulnerable using a script the maintainers provide in the GitHub Security Advisory, add `require_atomic? false` to any potentially affected update action, replace any usage of `Ash.update` with `Ash.bulk_update` for an affected action, and/or add an update timestamp to their action.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49756", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ash-project/ash_postgres/security/advisories/GHSA-hf59-7rwq-785m", "ref_desc": "Empty, atomic, non-bulk actions, policy bypass for side-effects vulnerability. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ash-project/ash_postgres \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://elixirforum.com/t/empty-update-action-with-policies/66954", "ref_desc": "Empty update action with policies? - Ash Forum / Ash Questions / Help - Elixir Programming Language Forum", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/zachdaniel/e49166b765978c48dfaf998d06df436e", "ref_desc": "Empty, atomic, non-bulk actions, policy bypass for side-effects vulnerability. \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ash-project/ash_postgres/commit/1228fcd851f29a68609e236f7d6a2622a4b5c4ba", "ref_desc": "fix: run any query that could produce errors when performing atomic u\u2026 \u00b7 ash-project/ash_postgres@1228fcd \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
