{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47826", "Description": "eLabFTW is an open source electronic lab notebook for research labs. A vulnerability in versions prior to 5.1.5 allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags in the pages: \"experiments.php\" (show mode), \"database.php\" (show mode) or \"search.php\". It works by providing HTML code in the extended search string, which will then be displayed back to the user in the error message. This means that injected HTML will appear in a red \"alert/danger\" box, and be part of an error message. Due to some other security measures, it is not possible to execute arbitrary javascript from this attack. As such, this attack is deemed low impact. Users should upgrade to at least version 5.1.5 to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47826", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElabftw\u00bbElabftwVersions  before (<) 5.1.5cpe:2.3:a:elabftw:elabftw:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/html-injection", "ref_desc": "HTML Injection - Vulnerabilities - AcunetixTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/security/advisories/GHSA-cjww-pr9f-4c4w", "ref_desc": "HTML Injection in extended search error message \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
