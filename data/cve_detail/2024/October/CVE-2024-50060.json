{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50060", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush\n\nIn terms of normal application usage, this list will always be empty.\nAnd if an application does overflow a bit, it'll have a few entries.\nHowever, nothing obviously prevents syzbot from running a test case\nthat generates a ton of overflow entries, and then flushing them can\ntake quite a while.\n\nCheck for needing to reschedule while flushing, and drop our locks and\ndo so if necessary. There's no state to maintain here as overflows\nalways prune from head-of-list, hence it's fine to drop and reacquire\nthe locks at the end of the loop.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50060", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.11andbefore (<) 6.11.4cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.6andbefore (<) 6.6.57cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.1andbefore (<) 6.1.113cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c2eadeafce2d385b3f6d26a7f31fee5aba2bbbb0", "ref_desc": "io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f4ce3b5d26ce149e77e6b8e8f2058aa80e5b034e", "ref_desc": "io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2493904e95ce94bbec819d8f7f03b99976eb25c", "ref_desc": "io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eac2ca2d682f94f46b1973bdf5e77d85d77b8e53", "ref_desc": "io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
