{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-48931", "Description": "ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the ZimaOS API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v3/file?token=<token>&files=<file_path>` is vulnerable to arbitrary file reading due to improper input validation. By manipulating the `files` parameter, authenticated users can read sensitive system files, including `/etc/shadow`, which contains password hashes for all users. This vulnerability exposes critical system data and poses a high risk for privilege escalation or system compromise. The vulnerability occurs because the API endpoint does not validate or restrict file paths provided via the `files` parameter. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the file path to access sensitive files outside the intended directory. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48931", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nIcewhale\u00bbZimaosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.4cpe:2.3:o:icewhale:zimaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZimaspace\u00bbZimaosVersions  before (<) 1.2.5cpe:2.3:a:zimaspace:zimaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.04%  0.11%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://youtu.be/FyIfcmCyDXs", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Read via Parameter Manipulation in ZimaOS - YouTubeExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-hjw2-9gq5-qgwj", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Read via Parameter Manipulation in ZimaOS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
