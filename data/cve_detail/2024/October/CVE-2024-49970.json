{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49970", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN401\n\n'stream_enc_regs' array is an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registers\nstructures. The array is initialized with four elements, corresponding\nto the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. This\nmeans that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe error message 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5 below, is indicating that\nthere is an attempt to access this array with an index of 5, which is\nout of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior\n\nHere, eng_id is used as an index to access the stream_enc_regs array. If\neng_id is 5, this would result in an out-of-bounds access on the\nstream_enc_regs array.\n\nThus fixing Buffer overflow error in dcn401_stream_encoder_create\n\nFound by smatch:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn401/dcn401_resource.c:1209 dcn401_stream_encoder_create() error: buffer overflow 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49970", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.11.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/129/Improper-Validation-of-Array-Index.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bdf606810210e8e07a0cdf1af3c467291363b295", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN401 - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b219b46ad42df1dea9258788bcfea37181f3ccb2", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN401 - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
