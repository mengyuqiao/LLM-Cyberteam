{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50010", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check\n\nBoth i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from an artifact\nof the previous implementation. They used to legitimately check for the\ncondition, but that got moved up in two commits:\n633fb6ac3980 (\"exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier\")\n0fd338b2d2cd (\"exec: move path_noexec() check earlier\")\n\nInstead of being removed said checks are WARN_ON'ed instead, which\nhas some debug value.\n\nHowever, the spurious path_noexec check is racy, resulting in\nunwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.\n\nOne can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowed\nand none of the conditions are guaranteed to still hold after they were\ntested for.\n\nAdditionally this does not validate whether the code path did any perm\nchecking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens to be\nregular.\n\nKeep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it's mindless\nnonsense checking for guarantee that isn't given so drop the WARN.\n\nReword the commentary and do small tidy ups while here.\n\n[brauner: keep redundant path_noexec() check]", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50010", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.11.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 \n 2  2024-11-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d16f53c91111cec914f0811fcc526a2ba77b20d", "ref_desc": "exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d62ba2a5536df83473a2ac15ab302258e3845251", "ref_desc": "exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b723f96407a0a078cf75970e4dbf16b46d286a61", "ref_desc": "exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c9b77438077d5a20c79ead95bcdaf9bd4797baaf", "ref_desc": "exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d196e7589cefe207d5d41f37a0a28a1fdeeb7c6", "ref_desc": "exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0bdf77be2330062b3a64f2bec39f62ab874a6796", "ref_desc": "exec: don't WARN for racy path_noexec check - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
