{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47816", "Description": "ImportDump is a mediawiki extension designed to automate user import requests. A user's local actor ID is stored in the database to tell who made what requests. Therefore, if a user on another wiki happens to have the same actor ID as someone on the central wiki, the user on the other wiki can act as if they're the original wiki requester. This can be abused to create new comments, edit the request, and view the request if it's marked private. This issue has been addressed in commit `5c91dfc` and all users are advised to update. Users unable to update may disable the special page outside of their global wiki. See `miraheze/mw-config@e566499` for details on that.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47816", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-282 Improper Ownership Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/282/Improper-Ownership-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/ImportDump/commit/5c91dfce78320e717516ee65ef5a05f01979ee6c", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 miraheze/ImportDump@5c91dfc \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/mw-config/commit/e5664995fbb8644f9a80b450b4326194f20f9ddc", "ref_desc": "T12102: Disable CreateWiki's special pages outside of the global wiki\u2026 \u00b7 miraheze/mw-config@e566499 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LtFesMUI-lBjpkPxXMSYYRDu2OE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12701", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/ImportDump/security/advisories/GHSA-jjmq-mg36-6387", "ref_desc": "Users can impersonate import requesters if their actor IDs coincide \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 miraheze/ImportDump \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
