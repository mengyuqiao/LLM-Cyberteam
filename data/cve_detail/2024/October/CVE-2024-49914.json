{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49914", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe\n\nThis commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in the\n`dcn20_program_pipe` function. The issue could occur when\n`pipe_ctx->plane_state` is null.\n\nThe fix adds a check to ensure `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is not null\nbefore accessing. This prevents a null pointer dereference.\n\nReported by smatch:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn20/dcn20_hwseq.c:1925 dcn20_program_pipe() error: we previously assumed 'pipe_ctx->plane_state' could be null (see line 1877)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49914", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.11.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/65a6fee22d5cfa645cb05489892dc9cd3d142fc2", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Add null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e4ed3cf1642df0c4456443d865cff61a9598aa8", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Add null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
