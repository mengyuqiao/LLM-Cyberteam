{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47818", "Description": "Saltcorn is an extensible, open source, no-code database application builder. A logged-in user with any role can delete arbitrary files on the filesystem by calling the `sync/clean_sync_dir` endpoint. The `dir_name` POST parameter is not validated/sanitized and is used to construct the `syncDir` that is deleted by calling `fs.rm`. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.0.0-beta16 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47818", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/saltcorn/saltcorn/commit/3c551261d0e230635774798009951fa83a07cc3a", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 saltcorn/saltcorn@3c55126 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/saltcorn/saltcorn/security/advisories/GHSA-43f3-h63w-p6f6", "ref_desc": "Logged-in users with any role can delete arbitrary files because of a path traversal vulnerability in `sync/clean_sync_dir` endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 saltcorn/saltcorn \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/saltcorn/saltcorn/blob/v1.0.0-beta.15/packages/server/routes/sync.js#L337-L346", "ref_desc": "saltcorn/packages/server/routes/sync.js at v1.0.0-beta.15 \u00b7 saltcorn/saltcorn \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
