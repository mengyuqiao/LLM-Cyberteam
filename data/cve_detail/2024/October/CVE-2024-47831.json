{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47831", "Description": "Next.js is a React Framework for the Web. Cersions on the 10.x, 11.x, 12.x, 13.x, and 14.x branches before version 14.2.7 contain a vulnerability in the image optimization feature which allows for a potential Denial of Service (DoS) condition which could lead to excessive CPU consumption. Neither the `next.config.js` file that is configured with `images.unoptimized` set to `true` or `images.loader` set to a non-default value nor the Next.js application that is hosted on Vercel are affected. This issue was fully patched in Next.js `14.2.7`. As a workaround, ensure that the `next.config.js` file has either `images.unoptimized`, `images.loader` or `images.loaderFile` assigned.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47831", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nVercel\u00bbNext.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 14.2.7cpe:2.3:a:vercel:next.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/d11cbc9ff0b1aaefabcba9afe1e562e0b1fde65a", "ref_desc": "Reject next image urls in image optimizer (#68628) \u00b7 vercel/next.js@d11cbc9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-g77x-44xx-532m", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service condition in Next.js image optimization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
