{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47943", "Description": "The firmware upgrade function in the admin web interface of the Rittal\u00a0IoT Interface & CMC III Processing Unit devices checks if \nthe patch files are signed before executing the containing run.sh \nscript. The signing process is kind of an HMAC with a long string as key\n which is hard-coded in the firmware and is freely available for \ndownload. This allows crafting malicious \"signed\" .patch files in order \nto compromise the device and execute arbitrary code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47943", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.rittal.com/de-de/products/deep/3124300", "ref_desc": "3124300 IoT InterfaceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1WGXz9tTRPRuYUO-nfsT6Zso4zs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://r.sec-consult.com/rittaliot", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities in Rittal IoT Interface & CMC III Processing Unit - SEC ConsultCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gdbU19QkKxoR2yILwHAVxqt7tXA.html"}]}
