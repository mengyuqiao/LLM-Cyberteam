{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47490", "Description": "An Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE)\u00a0of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause increased consumption of resources, ultimately resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen specific transit MPLS packets are received by the PFE, these packets are internally forwarded to the Routing Engine (RE), rather than being handled appropriately. Continuous receipt of these MPLS packets causes resources to be exhausted. MPLS config is not required to be affected by this issue.\u00a0\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved ACX 7000 Series:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9-EVO,\n  *  22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S2-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  23.4-EVO before 23.4R1-S1-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47490", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-923 Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/923/Improper-Restriction-of-Communication-Channel-to-Intended-En.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA83009", "ref_desc": "{!Record._Title}", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
