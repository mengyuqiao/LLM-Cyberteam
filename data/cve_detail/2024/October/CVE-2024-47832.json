{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47832", "Description": "ssoready is a single sign on provider implemented via docker. Affected versions are vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks. An attacker can carry out signature bypass if you have access to certain IDP-signed messages. The underlying mechanism exploits differential behavior between XML parsers. Users of https://ssoready.com, the public hosted instance of SSOReady, are unaffected. We advise folks who self-host SSOReady to upgrade to 7f92a06 or later. Do so by updating your SSOReady Docker images from sha-... to sha-7f92a06. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47832", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ssoready.com/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting-sso-ready", "ref_desc": "Self-Hosting SSOReady \u2014 SSOReady Docs", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/commit/7f92a0630439972fcbefa8c7eafe8c144bd89915", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 ssoready/ssoready@7f92a06 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/security/advisories/GHSA-j2hr-q93x-gxvh", "ref_desc": "XML Signature Bypass via differential XML parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ssoready/ssoready \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
