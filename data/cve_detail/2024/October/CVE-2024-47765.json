{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47765", "Description": "Minecraft MOTD Parser is a PHP library to parse minecraft server motd. The HtmlGenerator class is subject to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through a parsed malformed Minecraft server MOTD. The HtmlGenerator iterates through objects of MotdItem that are contained in an object of MotdItemCollection to generate a HTML string. An attacker can make malicious inputs to the color and text properties of MotdItem to inject own HTML into a web page during web page generation. For example by sending a malicious MOTD from a Minecraft server under their control that was queried and passed to the HtmlGenerator. This XSS vulnerability exists because the values of these properties are neither filtered nor escaped. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.6.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47765", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nJgniecki\u00bbMinecraft Motd ParserVersions  before (<) 1.0.6cpe:2.3:a:jgniecki:minecraft_motd_parser:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jgniecki/MinecraftMotdParser/security/advisories/GHSA-q898-frwq-f3qp", "ref_desc": "HtmlGenerator vulnerable to XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jgniecki/MinecraftMotdParser \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jgniecki/MinecraftMotdParser/commit/b0ab9d68a964cd3d74977f39a9e7af0a94509f7c", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 jgniecki/MinecraftMotdParser@b0ab9d6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
