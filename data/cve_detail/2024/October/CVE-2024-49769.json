{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49769", "Description": "Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call getpeername() waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49769", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAgendaless\u00bbWaitressVersions  before (<) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:agendaless:waitress:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/772/Missing-Release-of-Resource-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/435", "ref_desc": "Remove race condition when creating new HTTPChannel by digitalresistor \u00b7 Pull Request #435 \u00b7 Pylons/waitress \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/1ae4e894c9f76543bee06584001583fc6fa8c95c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #435 from Pylons/bugfix/remove-race-condition \u00b7 Pylons/waitress@1ae4e89 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418", "ref_desc": "100% cpu in mainthread due to not closing properly?
