{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47888", "Description": "Action Text brings rich text content and editing to Rails. Starting in version 6.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the `plain_text_for_blockquote_node helper` in Action Text. Carefully crafted text can cause the `plain_text_for_blockquote_node` helper to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. As a workaround, users can avoid calling `plain_text_for_blockquote_node` or upgrade to Ruby 3.2. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47888", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ba286c0a310b7f19cf5cac2a7a4c9def5cf9882e", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracing in plain_text_for_blockquote_node \u00b7 rails/rails@ba286c0 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/de0df7caebd9cb238a6f10dca462dc5f8d5e98b5", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracing in plain_text_for_blockquote_node \u00b7 rails/rails@de0df7c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-wwhv-wxv9-rpgw", "ref_desc": "Possible ReDoS vulnerability in plain_text_for_blockquote_node in Action Text \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rails/rails \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/4f4312b21a6448336de7c7ab0c4d94b378def468", "ref_desc": "ActionText: Avoid backtracing in plain_text_for_blockquote_node \u00b7 rails/rails@4f4312b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/727b0946c3cab04b825c039435eac963d4e91822", "ref_desc": "ActionText: Avoid backtracing in plain_text_for_blockquote_node \u00b7 rails/rails@727b094 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
