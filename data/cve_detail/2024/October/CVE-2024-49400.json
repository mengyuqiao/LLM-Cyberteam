Configured allowed commands/arguments were intended to require a match on the entire string, but instead only enforced a match on a sub-string. That would have potentially allowed unauthorized commands to be executed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49400", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2024-49400", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-49400", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
