{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-48914", "Description": "Vendure is an open-source headless commerce platform. Prior to versions 3.0.5 and 2.3.3, a vulnerability in Vendure's asset server plugin allows an attacker to craft a request which is able to traverse the server file system and retrieve the contents of arbitrary files, including sensitive data such as configuration files, environment variables, and other critical data stored on the server. In the same code path is an additional vector for crashing the server via a malformed URI. Patches are available in versions 3.0.5 and 2.3.3. Some workarounds are also available. One may use object storage rather than the local file system, e.g. MinIO or S3, or define middleware which detects and blocks requests with urls containing `/../`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48914", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-23  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/blob/801980e8f599c28c5059657a9d85dd03e3827992/packages/asset-server-plugin/src/plugin.ts#L352-L358", "ref_desc": "vendure/packages/asset-server-plugin/src/plugin.ts at 801980e8f599c28c5059657a9d85dd03e3827992 \u00b7 vendure-ecommerce/vendure \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/commit/e4b58af6822d38a9c92a1d8573e19288b8edaa1c", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 vendure-ecommerce/vendure@e4b58af \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/commit/e2ee0c43159b3d13b51b78654481094fdd4850c5", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 vendure-ecommerce/vendure@e2ee0c4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/security/advisories/GHSA-r9mq-3c9r-fmjq", "ref_desc": "Local file read vulnerability with AssetServerPlugin & LocalAssetStorageStrategy \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vendure-ecommerce/vendure \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
