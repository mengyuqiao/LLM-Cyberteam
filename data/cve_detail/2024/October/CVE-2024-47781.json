{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47781", "Description": "CreateWiki is an extension used at Miraheze for requesting & creating wikis. The name of requested wikis is not escaped on Special:RequestWikiQueue, so a user can insert arbitrary HTML that is displayed in the request wiki queue when requesting a wiki. If a wiki creator comes across the XSS payload, their user session can be abused to retrieve deleted wiki requests, which typically contains private information. Likewise, this can also be abused on those with the ability to suppress requests to view sensitive information. This issue has been patched with commit `693a220` and all users are advised to apply the patch. Users unable to upgrade should disable Javascript and/or prevent access to the vulnerable page (Special:RequestWikiQueue).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47781", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMiraheze\u00bbCreatewikiVersions  from including (>=) 2018-11-07andbefore (<) 2024-10-07cpe:2.3:a:miraheze:createwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMiraheze\u00bbCreatewiki\u00bbVersion:cpe:2.3:a:miraheze:createwiki:0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/CreateWiki/commit/693a220f399ee7eb4d00e77c3c667e864b1bd306", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 miraheze/CreateWiki@693a220 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12693", "ref_desc": "Issue Tracking;Product", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/CreateWiki/security/advisories/GHSA-h527-jh77-5g7j", "ref_desc": "XSS in Special:RequestWikiQueue when displaying sitename \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 miraheze/CreateWiki \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
