{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47609", "Description": "Tonic is a native gRPC client & server implementation with async/await support. When using tonic::transport::Server there is a remote DoS attack that can cause the server to exit cleanly on accepting a TCP/TLS stream. This can be triggered by causing the accept call to error out with errors that were not covered correctly causing the accept loop to exit. Upgrading to tonic 0.12.3 and above contains the fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47609", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/issues/1897", "ref_desc": "The tonic server process exit unexpected when the client get a wrong tls config \u00b7 Issue #1897 \u00b7 hyperium/tonic \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/commit/a4472a86f3290e60c7c01348b7e6a8164d6e7e48", "ref_desc": "server: ignore more error kinds in incoming socket stream (#1885) \u00b7 hyperium/tonic@a4472a8 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/security/advisories/GHSA-4jwc-w2hc-78qv", "ref_desc": "Remotely exploitable DoS in Tonic `<=v0.12.2` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hyperium/tonic \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
