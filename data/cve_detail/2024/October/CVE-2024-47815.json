{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47815", "Description": "IncidentReporting is a MediaWiki extension for moving incident reports from wikitext to database tables. There are a variety of Cross-site Scripting issues, though all of them require elevated permissions. Some are available to anyone who has the `editincidents` right, some are available to those who can edit interface messages (typically administrators and interface admins), and one is available to those who can edit LocalSettings.php. These issues have been addressed in commit `43896a4` and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should prevent access to the Special:IncidentReports page.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47815", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12702", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/IncidentReporting/security/advisories/GHSA-9p36-hrmr-98r9", "ref_desc": "Several XSSes in IncidentReporting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 miraheze/IncidentReporting \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/IncidentReporting/commit/43896a47de4e05ac94ec0472c220da944da16c5c", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 miraheze/IncidentReporting@43896a4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
