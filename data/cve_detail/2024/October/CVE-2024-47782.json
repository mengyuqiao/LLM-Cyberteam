{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47782", "Description": "WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki managed farm to display wikis. Special:WikiDiscover is a special page that lists all wikis on the wiki farm. However, the special page does not make any effort to escape the wiki name or description. Therefore, if a wiki sets its name and/or description to an XSS payload, the XSS will execute whenever the wiki is shown on Special:WikiDiscover. This issue has been patched with commit `2ce846dd93` and all users are advised to apply that patch. User unable to upgrade should block access to `Special:WikiDiscover`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47782", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMiraheze\u00bbWikidiscoverVersions  before (<) 2024-10-06cpe:2.3:a:miraheze:wikidiscover:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMiraheze\u00bbWikidiscover\u00bbVersion:cpe:2.3:a:miraheze:wikidiscover:0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12697", "ref_desc": "Issue Tracking;Product", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/commit/2ce846dd93ddb9ec86f7472c4d57fe71a09dc827", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 miraheze/WikiDiscover@2ce846d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/security/advisories/GHSA-wf48-rqx3-39mf", "ref_desc": "XSS in Special:WikiDiscover when displaying wiki information \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 miraheze/WikiDiscover \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
