{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47611", "Description": "XZ Utils provide a general-purpose data-compression library plus command-line tools. When built for native Windows (MinGW-w64 or MSVC), the command line tools from XZ Utils 5.6.2 and older have a command line argument injection vulnerability. If a command line contains Unicode characters (for example, filenames) that don't exist in the current legacy code page, the characters are converted to similar-looking characters with best-fit mapping. Some best-fit mappings result in ASCII characters that change the meaning of the command line, which can be exploited with malicious filenames to do argument injection or directory traversal attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.6.3. Command line tools built for Cygwin or MSYS2 are unaffected. liblzma is unaffected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47611", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-176 Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/176/Improper-Handling-of-Unicode-Encoding.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/security/advisories/GHSA-m538-c5qw-3cg4", "ref_desc": "XZ Utils on Microsoft Windows platform are vulnerable to argument injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tukaani-project/xz \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/bf518b9ba446327a062ddfe67e7e0a5baed2394f", "ref_desc": "Windows: Embed an application manifest in the EXE files \u00b7 tukaani-project/xz@bf518b9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
