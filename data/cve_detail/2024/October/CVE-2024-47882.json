{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47882", "Description": "OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, the built-in \"Something went wrong!\" error page includes the exception message and exception traceback without escaping HTML tags, enabling injection into the page if an attacker can reliably produce an error with an attacker-influenced message. It appears that the only way to reach this code in OpenRefine itself is for an attacker to somehow convince a victim to import a malicious file, which may be difficult.  However, out-of-tree extensions may add their own calls to `respondWithErrorPage`. Version 3.8.3 has a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47882", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenrefine\u00bbOpenrefineVersions  before (<) 3.8.3cpe:2.3:a:openrefine:openrefine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-29  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-81 Improper Neutralization of Script in an Error Message Web Page", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/81/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-in-an-Error-Message-Web-Pa.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/main/webapp/modules/core/error.vt#L52-L53", "ref_desc": "OpenRefine/main/webapp/modules/core/error.vt at master \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-j8hp-f2mj-586g", "ref_desc": "Error page lacks escaping, leading to potential XSS on import of malicious project \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/85594e75e7b36025f7b6a67dcd3ec253c5dff8c2", "ref_desc": "error page: escape error and stack trace \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine@85594e7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
