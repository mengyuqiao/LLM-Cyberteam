{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-48915", "Description": "Agent Dart is an agent library built for Internet Computer for Dart and Flutter apps. Prior to version 1.0.0-dev.29, certificate verification in `lib/agent/certificate.dart` does not occur properly. During the delegation verification in the `_checkDelegation` function, the canister_ranges aren't verified. The impact of not checking the canister_ranges is that a subnet can sign canister responses in behalf of another subnet. The certificate\u2019s timestamp, i.e /time path, is also not verified, meaning that the certificate effectively has no expiration time. Version 1.0.0-dev.29 implements appropriate certificate verification.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48915", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/commit/0d200686aabcd9313c7bc3e675cbdc82f6b775cf", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 AstroxNetwork/agent_dart@0d20068 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/blob/main/lib/agent/certificate.dart", "ref_desc": "File not found \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/blob/f50971dfae3f536c1720f0084f28afbcf5d99cb5/lib/agent/certificate.dart#L162", "ref_desc": "agent_dart/lib/agent/certificate.dart at f50971dfae3f536c1720f0084f28afbcf5d99cb5 \u00b7 AstroxNetwork/agent_dart \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/security/advisories/GHSA-fmj7-7gfw-64pg", "ref_desc": "Missing certificate verification checks \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 AstroxNetwork/agent_dart \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
