{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49359", "Description": "ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v2_1/file` in ZimaOS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing authenticated users to list the contents of any directory on the server. By manipulating the path parameter, attackers can access sensitive system directories such as `/etc`, potentially exposing critical configuration files and increasing the risk of further attacks. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49359", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nIcewhale\u00bbZimaosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.4cpe:2.3:o:icewhale:zimaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZimaspace\u00bbZimaosVersions  before (<) 1.2.5cpe:2.3:a:zimaspace:zimaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.04%  0.11%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-mwpw-fhrm-728x", "ref_desc": "Directory Listing via Parameter Manipulation in ZimaOS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://youtu.be/IuaEH09ot9s", "ref_desc": "Directory Listing via Parameter Manipulation in ZimaOS - YouTubeExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
