{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49760", "Description": "OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. The load-language command expects a `lang` parameter from which it constructs the path of the localization file to load, of the form `translations-$LANG.json`. But when doing so in versions prior to 3.8.3, it does not check that the resulting path is in the expected directory, which means that this command could be exploited to read other JSON files on the file system. Version 3.8.3 addresses this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49760", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenrefine\u00bbOpenrefineVersions  before (<) 3.8.3cpe:2.3:a:openrefine:openrefine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-qfwq-6jh6-8xx4", "ref_desc": "Path traversal in LoadLanguageCommand \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/24d084052dc55426fe460f2a17524fd18d28b20c", "ref_desc": "Prevent directory slip in LoadLanguageCommand \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine@24d0840 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
