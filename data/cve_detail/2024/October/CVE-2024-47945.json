{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47945", "Description": "The devices are vulnerable to session hijacking due to insufficient \nentropy in its session ID generation algorithm. The session IDs are \npredictable, with only 32,768 possible values per user, which allows \nattackers to pre-generate valid session IDs, leading to unauthorized \naccess to user sessions. This is not only due to the use of an \n(insecure) rand() function call but also because of missing \ninitialization via srand(). As a result only the PIDs are effectively \nused as seed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47945", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nRittal\u00bbIot Interface FirmwareVersions  before (<) 6.21.00.2cpe:2.3:o:rittal:iot_interface_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Rittal\u00bbIot Interface\u00bbVersion:N/A\nRittal\u00bbCmc Iii Processing Units FirmwareVersions  before (<) 6.21.00.2cpe:2.3:o:rittal:cmc_iii_processing_units_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Rittal\u00bbCmc Iii Processing Units\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-22  0.04%  0.11%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/331/Insufficient-Entropy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-340 Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/340/Generation-of-Predictable-Numbers-or-Identifiers.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.rittal.com/de-de/products/deep/3124300", "ref_desc": "3124300 IoT InterfaceProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1WGXz9tTRPRuYUO-nfsT6Zso4zs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://r.sec-consult.com/rittaliot", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities in Rittal IoT Interface & CMC III Processing Unit - SEC ConsultExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gdbU19QkKxoR2yILwHAVxqt7tXA.html"}]}
