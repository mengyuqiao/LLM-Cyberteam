{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50334", "Description": "Scoold is a Q&A and a knowledge sharing platform for teams. A semicolon path injection vulnerability was found on the /api;/config endpoint. By appending a semicolon in the URL, attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorised access to sensitive configuration data. Furthermore, PUT requests on the /api;/config endpoint while setting the Content-Type: application/hocon header allow unauthenticated attackers to file reading via HOCON file inclusion. This allows attackers to retrieve sensitive information such as configuration files from the server, which can be leveraged for further exploitation. The vulnerability has been fixed in Scoold 1.64.0. A workaround would be to disable the Scoold API with scoold.api_enabled = false.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50334", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nErudika\u00bbScooldVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.64.0cpe:2.3:a:erudika:scoold:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/288/Authentication-Bypass-Using-an-Alternate-Path-or-Channel.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Erudika/scoold/security/advisories/GHSA-fhwp-f6g7-rr3p", "ref_desc": "Semicolon Path Injection on API /api;/config \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Erudika/scoold \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
