{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47824", "Description": "matrix-react-sdk is react-based software development kit for inserting a Matrix chat/VOIP client into a web page. Starting in version 3.18.0 and before 3.102.0, matrix-react-sdk allows a malicious homeserver to potentially steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite. Version 3.102.0 fixes this issue by disabling sharing message keys on invite by removing calls to the vulnerable functionality. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47824", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/12618", "ref_desc": "Remove room key history sharing by uhoreg \u00b7 Pull Request #12618 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/commit/6fc9d7641c51ca3db8225cf58b9d6e6fdd2d6556", "ref_desc": "Remove room key history sharing (#12618) \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk@6fc9d76 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-qcvh-p9jq-wp8v", "ref_desc": "Malicious homeservers can steal message keys when the matrix-react-sdk user invites another user to a room \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
