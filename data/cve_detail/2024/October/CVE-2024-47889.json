{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47889", "Description": "Action Mailer is a framework for designing email service layers. Starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the block_format helper in Action Mailer. Carefully crafted text can cause the block_format helper to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. As a workaround, users can avoid calling the `block_format` helper or upgrade to Ruby 3.2. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 requires Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47889", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/0e5694f4d32544532d2301a9b4084eacb6986e94", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracking in ActionMailer block_format \u00b7 rails/rails@0e5694f \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/be898cc996986decfe238341d96b2a6573b8fd2e", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracking in ActionMailer block_format \u00b7 rails/rails@be898cc \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3612e3eb3fbafed4f85e1c6ea4c7b6addbb0fdd3", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracking in ActionMailer block_format \u00b7 rails/rails@3612e3e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-h47h-mwp9-c6q6", "ref_desc": "Possible ReDoS vulnerability in block_format in Action Mailer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rails/rails \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/985f1923fa62806ff676e41de67c3b4552131ab9", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracking in ActionMailer block_format \u00b7 rails/rails@985f192 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
