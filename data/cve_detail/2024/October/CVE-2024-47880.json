{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47880", "Description": "OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, the `export-rows` command can be used in such a way that it reflects part of the request verbatim, with a Content-Type header also taken from the request. An attacker could lead a user to a malicious page that submits a form POST that contains  embedded JavaScript code. This code would then be included in the response, along with an attacker-controlled `Content-Type` header, and so potentially executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. The attacker-provided code can do anything the user can do, including deleting projects, retrieving database passwords, or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions, if those extensions are also present. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47880", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenrefine\u00bbOpenrefineVersions  before (<) 3.8.3cpe:2.3:a:openrefine:openrefine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-31  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-348 Use of Less Trusted Source", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/348/Use-of-Less-Trusted-Source.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/8060477fa53842ebabf43b63e039745932fa629d", "ref_desc": "export:\u00a0Fix XSS vulnerability \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine@8060477 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-79jv-5226-783f", "ref_desc": "Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) from POST request in ExportRowsCommand \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
