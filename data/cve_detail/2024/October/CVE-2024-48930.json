{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-48930", "Description": "secp256k1-node is a Node.js binding for an Optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1. In `elliptic`-based version, `loadUncompressedPublicKey` has a check that the public key is on the curve. Prior to versions 5.0.1, 4.0.4, and 3.8.1, however, `loadCompressedPublicKey` is missing that check. That allows the attacker to use public keys on low-cardinality curves to extract enough information to fully restore the private key from as little as 11 ECDH sessions, and very cheaply on compute power. Other operations on public keys are also affected, including e.g. `publicKeyVerify()` incorrectly returning `true` on those invalid keys, and e.g. `publicKeyTweakMul()` also returning predictable outcomes allowing to restore the tweak. Versions 5.0.1, 4.0.4, and 3.8.1 contain a fix for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48930", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-354 Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/354/Improper-Validation-of-Integrity-Check-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/blob/6d3474b81d073cc9c8cc8cfadb580c84f8df5248/lib/elliptic.js#L37-L39", "ref_desc": "secp256k1-node/lib/elliptic.js at 6d3474b81d073cc9c8cc8cfadb580c84f8df5248 \u00b7 cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/commit/e256905ee649a7caacc251f7c964667195a52221", "ref_desc": "elliptic: fix key verification in loadCompressedPublicKey \u00b7 cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node@e256905 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/blob/6d3474b81d073cc9c8cc8cfadb580c84f8df5248/lib/elliptic.js#L17-L19", "ref_desc": "secp256k1-node/lib/elliptic.js at 6d3474b81d073cc9c8cc8cfadb580c84f8df5248 \u00b7 cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/security/advisories/GHSA-584q-6j8j-r5pm", "ref_desc": "Private key extraction over ECDH \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/commit/8bd6446e000fa59df3cda0ae3e424300747ea5ed", "ref_desc": "elliptic: fix key verification in loadCompressedPublicKey \u00b7 cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node@8bd6446 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/commit/9a15fff274f83a6ec7f675f1121babcc0c42292f", "ref_desc": "elliptic: fix key verification in loadCompressedPublicKey \u00b7 cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node@9a15fff \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
