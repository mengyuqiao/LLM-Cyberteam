{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50347", "Description": "Laravel Reverb provides a real-time WebSocket communication backend for Laravel applications. Prior to 1.4.0, there is an issue where verification signatures for requests sent to Reverb's Pusher-compatible API were not being verified. This API is used in scenarios such as broadcasting a message from a backend service or for obtaining statistical information (such as number of connections) about a given channel. This issue only affects the Pusher-compatible API endpoints and not the WebSocket connections themselves. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the application ID which, should never be exposed, would need to be known by an attacker. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50347", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/reverb/security/advisories/GHSA-pfrr-xvrf-pxjx", "ref_desc": "Missing API Signature Verification \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 laravel/reverb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/reverb/pull/252", "ref_desc": "[1.x] Implements API signature verification by joedixon \u00b7 Pull Request #252 \u00b7 laravel/reverb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/reverb/releases/tag/v1.4.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.4.0 \u00b7 laravel/reverb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/reverb/commit/73cc140d76e803b151fc2dd2e4eb3eb784a82ee2", "ref_desc": "[1.x] Implements API signature verification (#252) \u00b7 laravel/reverb@73cc140 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
