{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49361", "Description": "ACON is a widely-used library of tools for machine learning that focuses on adaptive correlation optimization. A potential vulnerability has been identified in the input validation process, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. This issue could allow an attacker to submit malicious input data, bypassing input validation, resulting in remote code execution in certain machine learning applications using the ACON library. All users utilizing ACON\u2019s input-handling functions are potentially at risk. Specifically, machine learning models or applications that ingest user-generated data without proper sanitization are the most vulnerable. Users running ACON on production servers are at heightened risk, as the vulnerability could be exploited remotely. As of time of publication, it is unclear whether a fix is available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49361", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/torinriley/ACON/security/advisories/GHSA-345g-6rmp-3cv9", "ref_desc": "Potential Vulnerability in ACON Library: Improper Input Validation Leading to Malicious Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 torinriley/ACON \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
