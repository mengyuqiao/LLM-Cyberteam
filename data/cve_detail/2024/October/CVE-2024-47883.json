{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47883", "Description": "The OpenRefine fork of the MIT Simile Butterfly server is a modular web application framework. The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works: \"opening a connection\" to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file:/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths; the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the app's codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the server's filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (server-side request forgery with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victim's browser (cross-site scripting). If an app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (remote code execution). Version 1.2.6 contains a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47883", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Directory traversal;Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpenrefine\u00bbSimile-butterflyVersions  before (<) 1.2.6cpe:2.3:a:openrefine:simile-butterfly:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenrefine\u00bbButterflyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.6cpe:2.3:a:openrefine:butterfly:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-30  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-36 Absolute Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/36/Absolute-Path-Traversal.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/simile-butterfly/commit/537f64bfa72746f8b21d4bda461fad843435319c", "ref_desc": "Only serve resources within the expected directory \u00b7 OpenRefine/simile-butterfly@537f64b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/simile-butterfly/security/advisories/GHSA-3p8v-w8mr-m3x8", "ref_desc": "Path/URL confusion in resource handling leading to multiple weaknesses \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenRefine/simile-butterfly \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
