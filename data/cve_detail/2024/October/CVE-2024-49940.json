{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49940", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nl2tp: prevent possible tunnel refcount underflow\n\nWhen a session is created, it sets a backpointer to its tunnel. When\nthe session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnel\nrefcount if session->tunnel is non-NULL. However, session->tunnel is\nset in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incremented\nby l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window where\nsession->tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn't been\nbumped.\n\nMoving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial but\nl2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which uses\nsession->tunnel to get the tunnel's encap. Add an encap arg to\nl2tp_session_set_header_len to avoid using session->tunnel.\n\nIf l2tpv3 sessions have colliding IDs, it is possible for\nl2tp_v3_session_get to race with l2tp_session_register and fetch a\nsession which doesn't yet have session->tunnel set. Add a check for\nthis case.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49940", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.11.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/24256415d18695b46da06c93135f5b51c548b950", "ref_desc": "l2tp: prevent possible tunnel refcount underflow - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f7415e60c25a6108cd7955a20b2e66b6251ffe02", "ref_desc": "l2tp: prevent possible tunnel refcount underflow - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
