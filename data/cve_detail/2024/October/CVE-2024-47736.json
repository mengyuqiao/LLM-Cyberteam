{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47736", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properly\n\nsyzbot reported a task hang issue due to a deadlock case where it is\nwaiting for the folio lock of a cached folio that will be used for\ncache I/Os.\n\nAfter looking into the crafted fuzzed image, I found it's formed with\nseveral overlapped big pclusters as below:\n\n Ext:   logical offset   |  length :     physical offset    |  length\n   0:        0..   16384 |   16384 :     151552..    167936 |   16384\n   1:    16384..   32768 |   16384 :     155648..    172032 |   16384\n   2:    32768..   49152 |   16384 :  537223168.. 537239552 |   16384\n...\n\nHere, extent 0/1 are physically overlapped although it's entirely\n_impossible_ for normal filesystem images generated by mkfs.\n\nFirst, managed folios containing compressed data will be marked as\nup-to-date and then unlocked immediately (unlike in-place folios) when\ncompressed I/Os are complete.  If physical blocks are not submitted in\nthe incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency\nissues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec()\nand BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.\n\nSecond, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for\nefficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implement\neasily if overlapped big pclusters exist.  Again, these only appear in\nfuzzed images so let's simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages\nfor correctness.\n\nAdditionally, it justifies that referenced managed folios cannot be\ntruncated for now and reverts part of commit 2080ca1ed3e4 (\"erofs: tidy\nup `struct z_erofs_bvec`\") for simplicity although it shouldn't be any\ndifference.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47736", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 5.13andbefore (<) 6.10.13cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.11andbefore (<) 6.11.2cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-24  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-667 Improper Locking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/667/Improper-Locking.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9cfa199bcbbbba31cbf97b2786f44f4464f3f29a", "ref_desc": "erofs: handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properly - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9e2f9d34dd12e6e5b244ec488bcebd0c2d566c50", "ref_desc": "erofs: handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properly - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b9b30af0e86ffb485301ecd83b9129c9dfb7ebf8", "ref_desc": "erofs: handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properly - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
