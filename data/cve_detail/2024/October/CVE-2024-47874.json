{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47874", "Description": "Starlette is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework/toolkit. Prior to version 0.40.0, Starlette treats `multipart/form-data` parts without a `filename` as text form fields and buffers those in byte strings with no size limit. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large form fields and cause Starlette to both slow down significantly due to excessive memory allocations and copy operations, and also consume more and more memory until the server starts swapping and grinds to a halt, or the OS terminates the server process with an OOM error. Uploading multiple such requests in parallel may be enough to render a service practically unusable, even if reasonable request size limits are enforced by a reverse proxy in front of Starlette. This Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability affects all applications built with Starlette (or FastAPI) accepting form requests. Verison 0.40.0 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47874", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/encode/starlette/security/advisories/GHSA-f96h-pmfr-66vw", "ref_desc": "Denial of service (DoS) via multipart/form-data \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 encode/starlette \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/encode/starlette/commit/fd038f3070c302bff17ef7d173dbb0b007617733", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 encode/starlette@fd038f3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
