{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49370", "Description": "Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. When a PortalUserObject is connected to a PimcoreUser and \"Use Pimcore Backend Password\" is set to true, the change password function in Portal Profile sets the new password. Prior to Pimcore portal engine versions 4.1.7 and 3.1.16, the password is then set without hashing so it can be read by everyone. Everyone who combines PortalUser to PimcoreUsers and change passwords via profile settings could be affected. Versions 4.1.7 and 3.1.16 of the Pimcore portal engine fix the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49370", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPimcore\u00bbPimcoreVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.1.7cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:pimcore:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPimcore\u00bbPimcoreVersions  before (<) 3.1.16cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:pimcore:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/256/Plaintext-Storage-of-a-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-74p5-77rq-gfqc", "ref_desc": "Change-Password via Portal-Profile sets PimcoreBackendUser password without hashing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
