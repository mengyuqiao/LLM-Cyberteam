{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-48948", "Description": "The Elliptic package 6.5.7 for Node.js, in its for ECDSA implementation, does not correctly verify valid signatures if the hash contains at least four leading 0 bytes and when the order of the elliptic curve's base point is smaller than the hash, because of an _truncateToN anomaly. This leads to valid signatures being rejected. Legitimate transactions or communications may be incorrectly flagged as invalid.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48948", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/pull/322", "ref_desc": "ECDSA signature verification error due to leading zero by Markus-MS \u00b7 Pull Request #322 \u00b7 indutny/elliptic \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/issues/321", "ref_desc": "Invalid signature generation and signature verification. \u00b7 Issue #321 \u00b7 indutny/elliptic \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
