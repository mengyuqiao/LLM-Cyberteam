{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49922", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using them\n\n[WHAT & HOW]\nThese pointers are null checked previously in the same function,\nindicating they might be null as reported by Coverity. As a result,\nthey need to be checked when used again.\n\nThis fixes 3 FORWARD_NULL issue reported by Coverity.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49922", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.11andbefore (<) 6.11.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.10.14cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-26  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5e9386baa3033c369564d55de4bab62423e8a1d3", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using them - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/65e1d2c291553ef3f433a0b7109cc3002a5f40ae", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using them - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ff12bcd7deaeed25efb5120433c6a45dd5504a8", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using them - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
