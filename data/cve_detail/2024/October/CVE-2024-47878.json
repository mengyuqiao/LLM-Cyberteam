{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47878", "Description": "OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, the `/extension/gdata/authorized` endpoint includes the `state` GET parameter verbatim in a `<script>` tag in the output, so without escaping. An attacker could lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL containing JavaScript code, which would then cause that code to be executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. Version 3.8.3 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47878", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenrefine\u00bbOpenrefineVersions  before (<) 3.8.3cpe:2.3:a:openrefine:openrefine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-31  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-pw3x-c5vp-mfc3", "ref_desc": "Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) in GData extension (authorized.vt) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/10bf0874d67f1018a58b3732332d76b840192fea", "ref_desc": "gdata: check cb parameter in authorized command \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine@10bf087 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
