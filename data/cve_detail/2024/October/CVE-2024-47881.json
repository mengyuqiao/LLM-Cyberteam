{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47881", "Description": "OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Starting in version 3.4-beta and prior to version 3.8.3, in the `database` extension, the \"enable_load_extension\" property can be set for the SQLite integration, enabling an attacker to load (local or remote) extension DLLs and so run arbitrary code on the server. The attacker needs to have network access to the OpenRefine instance. Version 3.8.3 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47881", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenrefine\u00bbOpenrefineVersions  from including (>=) 3.4andbefore (<) 3.8.3cpe:2.3:a:openrefine:openrefine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-29  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/853a1d91662e7dc278a9a94a38be58de04494056", "ref_desc": "database extension: fix remote code execution vulnerability \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine@853a1d9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-87cf-j763-vvh8", "ref_desc": "SQLite integration allows filesystem access, remote code execution (RCE) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenRefine/OpenRefine \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
