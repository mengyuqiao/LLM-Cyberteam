{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49766", "Description": "Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface web application library. On Python < 3.11 on Windows, os.path.isabs() does not catch UNC paths like //server/share. Werkzeug's safe_join() relies on this check, and so can produce a path that is not safe, potentially allowing unintended access to data. Applications using Python >= 3.11, or not using Windows, are not vulnerable. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 contains a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49766", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-f9vj-2wh5-fj8j", "ref_desc": "safe_join can produce unsafe paths on Python < 3.11 on Windows \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pallets/werkzeug \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/3.0.6", "ref_desc": "Release 3.0.6 \u00b7 pallets/werkzeug \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fZ_656ZgDzIglYvWUd_NnfRLC9I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/2767bcb10a7dd1c297d812cc5e6d11a474c1f092", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 pallets/werkzeug@2767bcb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
