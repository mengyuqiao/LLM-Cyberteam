{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47823", "Description": "Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that allows for dynamic UI components without leaving PHP. In livewire/livewire prior to `2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a \u201c.php\u201d file extension. If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack: 1. Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`. 2. Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk. 3. Webserver is configured to execute \u201c.php\u201d files. This issue has been addressed in release versions `2.12.7` and `3.5.2`. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47823", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/security/advisories/GHSA-f3cx-396f-7jqp", "ref_desc": "Livewire Remote Code Execution on File Uploads \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 livewire/livewire \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/cd168c6212ea13d13b82b3132485741f82d9fad9", "ref_desc": "Fix image extensions validation vulnerability \u00b7 livewire/livewire@cd168c6 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/70503b79f5db75a1eac9bf55826038a6ee5a16d5", "ref_desc": "Fix image upload extension validation (#8624) \u00b7 livewire/livewire@70503b7 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/pull/8624", "ref_desc": "Fix image upload extension validation by calebporzio \u00b7 Pull Request #8624 \u00b7 livewire/livewire \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
