{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49750", "Description": "The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. Prior to version 3.12.3, when the logging level was set by the user to DEBUG, the Connector could have logged Duo passcodes (when specified via the `passcode` parameter) and Azure SAS tokens. Additionally, the SecretDetector logging formatter, if enabled, contained bugs which caused it to not fully redact JWT tokens and certain private key formats. Snowflake released version 3.12.3 of the Snowflake Connector for Python, which fixes the issue. In addition to upgrading, users should review their logs for any potentially sensitive information that may have been captured.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49750", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSnowflake\u00bbSnowflake Connector\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 3.12.3cpe:2.3:a:snowflake:snowflake_connector:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/security/advisories/GHSA-5vvg-pvhp-hv2m", "ref_desc": "Sensitive data in logs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/commit/dbc9284a3c0382c131b971b35e8d6ab93c46f37a", "ref_desc": "SNOW-1657037: Remove secrets from debug logs.
