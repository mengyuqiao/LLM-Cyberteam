{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49358", "Description": "ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Server-IP>/v1/users/login` in ZimaOS returns distinct responses based on whether a username exists or the password is incorrect. This behavior can be exploited for username enumeration, allowing attackers to determine whether a user exists in the system or not. Attackers can leverage this information in further attacks, such as credential stuffing or targeted password brute-forcing. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49358", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIcewhale\u00bbZimaosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.4cpe:2.3:o:icewhale:zimaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZimaspace\u00bbZimaosVersions  before (<) 1.2.5cpe:2.3:a:zimaspace:zimaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-3f6g-8r88-3mx5", "ref_desc": "Username Enumeration via API Responses in ZimaOS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://youtu.be/BClx2u8DMfM", "ref_desc": "Username Enumeration ZimaOS - YouTubeExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
