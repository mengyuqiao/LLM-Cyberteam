{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47610", "Description": "InvenTree is an Open Source Inventory Management System. In affected versions of InvenTree it is possible for a registered user to store javascript in markdown notes fields, which are then displayed to other logged in users who visit the same page and executed. The vulnerability has been addressed as follows: 1. HTML sanitization has been enabled in the front-end markdown rendering library - `easymde`. 2. Stored markdown is also validated on the backend, to ensure that malicious markdown is not stored in the database. These changes are available in release versions 0.16.5 and later. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds, an update is required to get the new validation functions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47610", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/security/advisories/GHSA-wp3m-jhgv-rhqr", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS Vulnerability in Markdown Editor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 inventree/InvenTree \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/commit/6e37f0cd8ba5fc527412f18f66cd6a37015fa690", "ref_desc": "Markdown xss backport (#8244) \u00b7 inventree/InvenTree@6e37f0c \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
