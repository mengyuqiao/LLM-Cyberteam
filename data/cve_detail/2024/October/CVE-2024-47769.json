{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47769", "Description": "IDURAR is open source ERP CRM accounting invoicing software. The vulnerability exists in the corePublicRouter.js file. Using the reference usage here, it is identified that the public endpoint is accessible to an unauthenticated user. The user's input is directly appended to the join statement without additional checks. This allows an attacker to send URL encoded malicious payload. The directory structure can be escaped to read system files by adding an encoded string (payload) at subpath location.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47769", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIdurar Project\u00bbIdurarVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.1.0cpe:2.3:a:idurar_project:idurar:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIdurarapp\u00bbIdurarVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.1.0cpe:2.3:a:idurarapp:idurar:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/idurar/idurar-erp-crm/commit/949bc6fe31f3175c9e1864d30cf6c8110179ac14", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 idurar/idurar-erp-crm@949bc6f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/idurar/idurar-erp-crm/security/advisories/GHSA-948g-2vm7-mfv7", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal (unauthenticated user can read sensitive data) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 idurar/idurar-erp-crm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
