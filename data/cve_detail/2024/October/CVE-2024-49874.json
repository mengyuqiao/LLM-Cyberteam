{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49874", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition\n\nIn the svc_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with\nsvc_i3c_master_hj_work, &master->ibi_work is bound with\nsvc_i3c_master_ibi_work. And svc_i3c_master_ibi_work  can start the\nhj_work, svc_i3c_master_irq_handler can start the ibi_work.\n\nIf we remove the module which will call svc_i3c_master_remove to\nmake cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister\nwhile the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations\nthat may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                         CPU1\n\n                                    | svc_i3c_master_hj_work\nsvc_i3c_master_remove               |\ni3c_master_unregister(&master->base)|\ndevice_unregister(&master->dev)     |\ndevice_release                      |\n//free master->base                 |\n                                    | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)\n                                    | //use master->base\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the\ncleanup in svc_i3c_master_remove.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49874", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.7andbefore (<) 6.10.14cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.11andbefore (<) 6.11.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.4andbefore (<) 6.6.55cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ac637122930cc4ab7e2c22e364cf3aaf96b05b1", "ref_desc": "i3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/27b55724d3f781dd6e635e89dc6e2fd78fa81a00", "ref_desc": "i3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/61850725779709369c7e907ae8c7c75dc7cec4f3", "ref_desc": "i3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4318998892bf8fe99f97bea18c37ae7b685af75a", "ref_desc": "i3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
