{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47870", "Description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function, allowing an attacker to modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate with the backend. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic to a malicious server. This could lead to the interception of sensitive data such as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This impacts all users who connect to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet, where malicious actors could exploit this race condition. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47870", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGradio Project\u00bbGradio\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions\nGradio Project\u00bbGradioVersions  before (<) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-18  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-xh2x-3mrm-fwqm", "ref_desc": "Race condition in update_root_in_config may redirect user traffic \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
