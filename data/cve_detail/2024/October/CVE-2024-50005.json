{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50005", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker\n\nIn the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, the `scan_req->type` field was\naccessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According\nto RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable\nbehavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing\nuse-after-free issues.\n\nThis possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed\nby myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.\n\nTo address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local\nvariable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical\nsection. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released,\nensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU\nrules.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50005", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.7andbefore (<) 6.10.14cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.11andbefore (<) 6.11.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.5andbefore (<) 6.6.55cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:6.12UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.12:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e676e4ea76bbe7f1156d8c326b9b6753849481c2", "ref_desc": "mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d18f669461811dfe2915d5554ab2a9834f810013", "ref_desc": "mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bff1709b3980bd7f80be6786f64cc9a9ee9e56da", "ref_desc": "mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/540138377b22f601f06f55ebfa3ca171dcab471a", "ref_desc": "mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
