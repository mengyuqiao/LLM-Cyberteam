{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47819", "Description": "Umbraco, a free and open source .NET content management system, has a cross-site scripting vulnerability starting in version 14.0.0 and prior to versions 14.3.1 and 15.0.0. This can be leveraged to gain access to higher-privilege endpoints, e.g. if you get a user with admin privileges to run the code, you can potentially elevate all users and grant them admin privileges or access protected content. Versions 14.3.1 and 15.0.0 contain a patch. As a workaround, ensure that access to the Dictionary section is only granted to trusted users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47819", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco CmsVersions  from including (>=) 14.0.0andbefore (<) 14.3.1cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-c5g6-6xf7-qxp3", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in the \u201cdictionary name\u201d on Dictionary section \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 umbraco/Umbraco-CMS \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
