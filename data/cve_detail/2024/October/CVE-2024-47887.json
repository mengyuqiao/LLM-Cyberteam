{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47887", "Description": "Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in Action Controller's HTTP Token authentication. For applications using HTTP Token authentication via `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or similar, a carefully crafted header may cause header parsing to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. One may choose to use Ruby 3.2 as a workaround.Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47887", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-vfg9-r3fq-jvx4", "ref_desc": "Possible ReDoS vulnerability in HTTP Token authentication in Action Controller \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rails/rails \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/f4dc83d8926509d0958ec21fcdbc2e7df3d32ce2", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracking in Token#raw_params \u00b7 rails/rails@f4dc83d \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/7c1398854d51f9bb193fb79f226647351133d08a", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracking in Token#raw_params \u00b7 rails/rails@7c13988 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/56b2fc3302836405b496e196a8d5fc0195e55049", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracking in Token#raw_params \u00b7 rails/rails@56b2fc3 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/8e057db25bff1dc7a98e9ae72e0083825b9ac545", "ref_desc": "Avoid backtracking in Token#raw_params \u00b7 rails/rails@8e057db \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
