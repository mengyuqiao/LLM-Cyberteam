{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-48909", "Description": "SpiceDB is an open source database for scalably storing and querying fine-grained authorization data. Starting in version 1.35.0 and prior to version 1.37.1, clients that have enabled `LookupResources2` and have caveats in the evaluation path for their requests can return a permissionship of `CONDITIONAL` with context marked as missing, even then the context was supplied. LookupResources2 is the new default in SpiceDB 1.37.0 and has been opt-in since SpiceDB 1.35.0. The bug is patched as part of SpiceDB 1.37.1. As a workaround, disable LookupResources2 via the `--enable-experimental-lookup-resources` flag by setting it to `false`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48909", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAuthzed\u00bbSpicedbVersions  from including (>=) 1.35.0andbefore (<) 1.37.1cpe:2.3:a:authzed:spicedb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-18  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-172 Encoding Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/172/Encoding-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/2f3cf77a7fcfcb478ef5a480a245842c96ac8853", "ref_desc": "Ensure caveat context is sent to all LR2 dispatches \u00b7 authzed/spicedb@2f3cf77 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-3c32-4hq9-6wgj", "ref_desc": "Calls to LookupResources using LookupResources2 with caveats may return context is missing when it is not \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
