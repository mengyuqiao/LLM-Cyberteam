{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49755", "Description": "Duende IdentityServer is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.x framework for ASP.NET Core. IdentityServer's local API authentication handler performs insufficient validation of the cnf claim in DPoP access tokens. This allows an attacker to use leaked DPoP access tokens at local api endpoints even without possessing the private key for signing proof tokens. Note that this only impacts custom endpoints within an IdentityServer implementation that have explicitly used the LocalApiAuthenticationHandler for authentication. This vulnerability is patched in IdentityServer 7.0.8. Version 6.3 and below are unaffected, as they do not support DPoP in Local APIs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49755", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/security/advisories/GHSA-v9xq-2mvm-x8xc", "ref_desc": "Insufficient validation of DPoP cnf claim in Local APIs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/commit/f28cac921c1f545afe65af71a9327224755b6dac", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer@f28cac9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
