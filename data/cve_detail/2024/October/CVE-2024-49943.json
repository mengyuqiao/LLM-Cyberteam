{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-49943", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe/guc_submit: add missing locking in wedged_fini\n\nAny non-wedged queue can have a zero refcount here and can be running\nconcurrently with an async queue destroy, therefore dereferencing the\nqueue ptr to check wedge status after the lookup can trigger UAF if\nqueue is not wedged.  Fix this by keeping the submission_state lock held\naround the check to postpone the free and make the check safe, before\ndropping again around the put() to avoid the deadlock.\n\n(cherry picked from commit d28af0b6b9580b9f90c265a7da0315b0ad20bbfd)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49943", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.11andbefore (<) 6.11.3cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:6.12UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.12:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-667 Improper Locking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/667/Improper-Locking.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/790533e44bfc7af929842fccd9674c9f424d4627", "ref_desc": "drm/xe/guc_submit: add missing locking in wedged_fini - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d88f9bab7e62dd0dbe983fa70cf040042a60cc84", "ref_desc": "drm/xe/guc_submit: add missing locking in wedged_fini - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
