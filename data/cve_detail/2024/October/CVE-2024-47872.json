{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47872", "Description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** on any Gradio server that allows file uploads. Authenticated users can upload files such as HTML, JavaScript, or SVG files containing malicious scripts. When other users download or view these files, the scripts will execute in their browser, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions or steal sensitive information from their sessions. This impacts any Gradio server that allows file uploads, particularly those using components that process or display user-uploaded files. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can restrict the types of files that can be uploaded to the Gradio server by limiting uploads to non-executable file types such as images or text. Additionally, developers can implement server-side validation to sanitize uploaded files, ensuring that HTML, JavaScript, and SVG files are properly handled or rejected before being stored or displayed to users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47872", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGradio Project\u00bbGradio\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions\nGradio Project\u00bbGradioVersions  before (<) 5.0cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-18  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-gvv6-33j7-884g", "ref_desc": "XSS on every Gradio server via upload of HTML files, JS files, or SVG files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
