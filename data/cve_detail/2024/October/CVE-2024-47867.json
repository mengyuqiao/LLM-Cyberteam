{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47867", "Description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability is a **lack of integrity check** on the downloaded FRP client, which could potentially allow attackers to introduce malicious code. If an attacker gains access to the remote URL from which the FRP client is downloaded, they could modify the binary without detection, as the Gradio server does not verify the file's checksum or signature.  Any users utilizing the Gradio server's sharing mechanism that downloads the FRP client could be affected by this vulnerability, especially those relying on the executable binary for secure data tunneling. There is no direct workaround for this issue without upgrading. However, users can manually validate the integrity of the downloaded FRP client by implementing checksum or signature verification in their own environment to ensure the binary hasn't been tampered with.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47867", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGradio Project\u00bbGradio\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions\nGradio Project\u00bbGradioVersions  before (<) 5.0cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-8c87-gvhj-xm8m", "ref_desc": "Lack of integrity check on the downloaded FRP client \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
