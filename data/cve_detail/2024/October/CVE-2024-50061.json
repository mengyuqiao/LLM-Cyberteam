{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-50061", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni3c: master: cdns: Fix use after free vulnerability in cdns_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition\n\nIn the cdns_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with\ncdns_i3c_master_hj. And cdns_i3c_master_interrupt can call\ncnds_i3c_master_demux_ibis function to start the work.\n\nIf we remove the module which will call cdns_i3c_master_remove to\nmake cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister\nwhile the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations\nthat may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                      CPU1\n\n                                     | cdns_i3c_master_hj\ncdns_i3c_master_remove               |\ni3c_master_unregister(&master->base) |\ndevice_unregister(&master->dev)      |\ndevice_release                       |\n//free master->base                  |\n                                     | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)\n                                     | //use master->base\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with\nthe cleanup in cdns_i3c_master_remove.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50061", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  from including (>=) 6.7andbefore (<) 6.11.4cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.6.57cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-24  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ea0256e393e0072e8c80fd941547807f0c28108b", "ref_desc": "i3c: master: cdns: Fix use after free vulnerability in cdns_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/687016d6a1efbfacdd2af913e2108de6b75a28d5", "ref_desc": "i3c: master: cdns: Fix use after free vulnerability in cdns_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/609366e7a06d035990df78f1562291c3bf0d4a12", "ref_desc": "i3c: master: cdns: Fix use after free vulnerability in cdns_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
