{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45489", "Description": "Arc before 2024-08-26 allows remote code execution in JavaScript boosts. Boosts that run JavaScript cannot be shared by default; however (because of misconfigured Firebase ACLs), it is possible to create or update a boost using another user's ID. This installs the boost in the victim's browser and runs arbitrary Javascript on that browser in a privileged context. NOTE: this is a no-action cloud vulnerability with zero affected users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45489", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41597250", "ref_desc": "Gaining access to anyones Arc browser without them even visiting a website | Hacker News", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://arc.net/blog/CVE-2024-45489-incident-response", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-45489 Response \u2013 Arc", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kibty.town/blog/arc/", "ref_desc": "gaining access to anyones browser without them even visiting a website - eva's site", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
