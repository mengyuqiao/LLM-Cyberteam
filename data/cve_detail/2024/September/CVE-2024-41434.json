{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-41434", "Description": "PingCAP TiDB v8.1.0 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the component (*Column).GetDecimal. This allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted input to the 'RemoveUnnecessaryFirstRow', it will check the expression between 'Agg' and 'GroupBy', but does not check the return type. NOTE: PingCAP disputes this, arguing that reproduction did not cause the security impact of service interruption to other users. They maintain it is a complex query bug in the product but not a DoS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41434", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/ycybfhb/4aa6809695b9e8a1cd1429e597c17517", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-41434 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/53733", "ref_desc": "runtime error: index out of range [3960] with length 3952 in `chunk.(*Column).GetDecimal` \u00b7 Issue #53733 \u00b7 pingcap/tidb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
