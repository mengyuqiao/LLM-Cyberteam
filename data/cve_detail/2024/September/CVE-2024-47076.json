{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47076", "Description": "CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libcupsfilters` contains the code of the filters of the former `cups-filters` package as library functions to be used for the data format conversion tasks needed in Printer Applications. The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47076", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfx-47qg-grp6", "ref_desc": "ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2 does not sanitize IPP attributes when creating the PPD buffer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenPrinting/libppd \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2MicS2DFJFb9Z2PeBKyCLjdYykA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8", "ref_desc": "Multiple bugs leading to info leak and remote code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenPrinting/cups-browsed \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/C6Jy85kFmoqxi3sI8VUz7a8dt1k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5", "ref_desc": "cfGetPrinterAttributes5 does not validate IPP attributes returned from an IPP server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mkmBicZCX5YGaOiYSCJbt4oifo8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-p9rh-jxmq-gq47", "ref_desc": "Command injection via FoomaticRIPCommandLine \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenPrinting/cups-filters \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PjP2IlZM_13PdYDd3mjyA2u4Hgs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cups.org", "ref_desc": "CUPS.orgCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rNe9XzuaG-i0P2r5qvxL9PZLXMM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I", "ref_desc": "Attacking UNIX Systems via CUPS, Part ICVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Xt0hTOCMeSWEOxZRf3U_qmUMujw.html"}]}
