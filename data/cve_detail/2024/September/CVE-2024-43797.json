{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43797", "Description": "audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. A non-admin user is not allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue. Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This issue has been addressed in release version 2.13.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43797", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nAudiobookshelf\u00bbAudiobookshelfVersions  before (<) 2.13.0cpe:2.3:a:audiobookshelf:audiobookshelf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAudiobookshelf\u00bbAudiobookshelfVersions  before (<) 2.13.0cpe:2.3:a:audiobookshelf:audiobookshelf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-14  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-ghsa-gg56-vj58-g5mc/pull/1", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/1c0d6e9c670ebb1b6f1e427a4c4d9250a7fb9b80/server/controllers/LibraryController.js#L43-L47", "ref_desc": "audiobookshelf/server/controllers/LibraryController.js at 1c0d6e9c670ebb1b6f1e427a4c4d9250a7fb9b80 \u00b7 advplyr/audiobookshelf \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-gg56-vj58-g5mc", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal (RBAC: A non-admin user can create directories anywhere in the system) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 advplyr/audiobookshelf \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
