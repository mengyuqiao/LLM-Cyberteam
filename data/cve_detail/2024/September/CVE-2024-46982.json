{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-46982", "Description": "Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. By sending a crafted HTTP request, it is possible to poison the cache of a non-dynamic server-side rendered route in the pages router (this does not affect the app router). When this crafted request is sent it could coerce Next.js to cache a route that is meant to not be cached and send a `Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate` header which some upstream CDNs may cache as well. To be potentially affected all of the following must apply: 1. Next.js between 13.5.1 and 14.2.9, 2. Using pages router, & 3. Using non-dynamic server-side rendered routes e.g. `pages/dashboard.tsx` not `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`. This vulnerability was resolved in Next.js v13.5.7, v14.2.10, and later. We recommend upgrading regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not. There are no official or recommended workarounds for this issue, we recommend that users patch to a safe version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46982", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/7ed7f125e07ef0517a331009ed7e32691ba403d3", "ref_desc": "Remove invalid fallback revalidate value (#69990) \u00b7 vercel/next.js@7ed7f12 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-gp8f-8m3g-qvj9", "ref_desc": "Cache Poisoning \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/bd164d53af259c05f1ab434004bcfdd3837d7cda", "ref_desc": "Remove invalid fallback revalidate value (#69990) \u00b7 vercel/next.js@bd164d5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
