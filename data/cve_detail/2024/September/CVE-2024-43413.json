{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43413", "Description": "Xibo is an open source digital signage platform with a web content management system (CMS). Prior to version 4.1.0, a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Xibo CMS allows authorized users to execute JavaScript via the DataSet functionality. Users can design a DataSet with a HTML column which contains JavaScript, which is intended functionality. The JavaScript gets executed on the Data Entry page and in any Layouts which reference it. This behavior has been changed in 4.1.0 to show HTML/CSS/JS as code on the Data Entry page. There are no workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43413", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nXibosignage\u00bbXiboVersions  before (<) 4.1.0cpe:2.3:a:xibosignage:xibo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/commit/009527855d8bfd0ffb95f5c88ed72b7b5bdebfa1", "ref_desc": "Datasets: Fixed HTML sanitation in datasets table (#2698) \u00b7 xibosignage/xibo-cms@0095278 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/security/advisories/GHSA-pfxp-vxh7-2h9f", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability using DataSet HTML columns \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xibosignage/xibo-cms \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
