{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45053", "Description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.44.0, the Email Templating feature uses Jinja2 without proper input sanitization or rendering environment restrictions, allowing for Server-Side Template Injection that grants Remote Code Execution to privileged users. A privileged user refers to an Admin UI user with the default `Owner` or `Contributor` role, who can escalate their access and execute code on the underlying Fides Webserver container where the Jinja template rendering function is executed. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.44.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45053", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nEthyca\u00bbFidesVersions  from including (>=) 2.19.0andbefore (<) 2.44.0cpe:2.3:a:ethyca:fides:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1336 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1336/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-Used-in-a-Templa.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/829cbd9cb5ef9c814fbac1ed6800e8d939d359c5", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 ethyca/fides@829cbd9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-c34r-238x-f7qx", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability via SSTI in Fides Webserver Jinja Email Templating Engine \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
