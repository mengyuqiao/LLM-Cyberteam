{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45307", "Description": "SudoBot, a Discord moderation bot, is vulnerable to privilege escalation and exploit of the `-config` command in versions prior to 9.26.7. Anyone is theoretically able to update any configuration of the bot and potentially gain control over the bot's settings. Every version of v9 before v9.26.7 is affected. Other versions (e.g. v8) are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 9.26.7 to receive a patch. A workaround would be to create a command permission overwrite in the Database. A SQL statement provided in the GitHub Security Advisor can be executed to create a overwrite that disallows users without `ManageGuild` permission to run the `-config` command. Run the SQL statement for every server the bot is in, and replace `<guild_id>` with the appropriate Guild ID each time.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45307", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOnesoftnet\u00bbSudobotVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.26.7cpe:2.3:a:onesoftnet:sudobot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOnesoftnet\u00bbSudobotVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.26.7cpe:2.3:a:onesoftnet:sudobot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-07  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/onesoft-sudo/sudobot/commit/ef46ca98562f3c1abef4ff7dd94d8f7b8155ee50", "ref_desc": "fix: config permission checks \u00b7 onesoft-sudo/sudobot@ef46ca9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/onesoft-sudo/sudobot/security/advisories/GHSA-crgg-w3rr-r9h4", "ref_desc": "Missing authorization check in `-config` command \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 onesoft-sudo/sudobot \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
