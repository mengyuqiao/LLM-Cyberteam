This should make it easier to\ncatch something rogue trying to mess with mmio after device removal. For\nexample, we might unmap everything and then start hitting some mmio\naddress which has already been unmamped by us and then remapped by\nsomething else, causing all kinds of carnage.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46705", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.10.7cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c7117419784f612d59ee565145f722e8b5541fe6", "ref_desc": "drm/xe: reset mmio mappings with devm - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b1c9fbed3884d3883021d699c7cdf5253a65543a", "ref_desc": "drm/xe: reset mmio mappings with devm - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
