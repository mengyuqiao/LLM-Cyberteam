{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45606", "Description": "Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring platform. An authenticated user can mute alert rules from arbitrary organizations and projects with a know rule ID. The user does not need to be a member of the organization or have permissions on the project.  In our review, we have identified no instances where alerts have been muted by unauthorized parties.  A patch was issued to ensure authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to mute alert rules. Authenticated users who do not have the necessary permissions are no longer able to mute alerts.  Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. Self-Hosted Sentry users should upgrade to version **24.9.0** or higher. The rule mute feature was generally available as of 23.6.0 but users with early access may have had the feature as of 23.4.0. Affected users are advised to upgrade to version 24.9.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45606", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSentry\u00bbSentryVersions  from including (>=) 23.4.0andbefore (<) 24.9.0cpe:2.3:a:sentry:sentry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-v345-w9f2-mpm5", "ref_desc": "Improper authorization on muting of alert rules \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/77016", "ref_desc": "fix(alerts): Prevent muting alerts by schew2381 \u00b7 Pull Request #77016 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted", "ref_desc": "GitHub - getsentry/self-hosted: Sentry, feature-complete and packaged up for low-volume deployments and proofs-of-conceptNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/reQzB5Mfnb5-rPQpTMSrEdxm8ak.html"}]}
