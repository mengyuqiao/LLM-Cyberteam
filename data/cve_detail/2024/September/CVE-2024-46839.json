{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-46839", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nworkqueue: Improve scalability of workqueue watchdog touch\n\nOn a ~2000 CPU powerpc system, hard lockups have been observed in the\nworkqueue code when stop_machine runs (in this case due to CPU hotplug).\nThis is due to lots of CPUs spinning in multi_cpu_stop, calling\ntouch_nmi_watchdog() which ends up calling wq_watchdog_touch().\nwq_watchdog_touch() writes to the global variable wq_watchdog_touched,\nand that can find itself in the same cacheline as other important\nworkqueue data, which slows down operations to the point of lockups.\n\nIn the case of the following abridged trace, worker_pool_idr was in\nthe hot line, causing the lockups to always appear at idr_find.\n\n  watchdog: CPU 1125 self-detected hard LOCKUP @ idr_find\n  Call Trace:\n  get_work_pool\n  __queue_work\n  call_timer_fn\n  run_timer_softirq\n  __do_softirq\n  do_softirq_own_stack\n  irq_exit\n  timer_interrupt\n  decrementer_common_virt\n  * interrupt: 900 (timer) at multi_cpu_stop\n  multi_cpu_stop\n  cpu_stopper_thread\n  smpboot_thread_fn\n  kthread\n\nFix this by having wq_watchdog_touch() only write to the line if the\nlast time a touch was recorded exceeds 1/4 of the watchdog threshold.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46839", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-02  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2abd35e7dc55bf9ed01e2b3481fa78e086d3bf4", "ref_desc": "workqueue: Improve scalability of workqueue watchdog touch - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/98f887f820c993e05a12e8aa816c80b8661d4c87", "ref_desc": "workqueue: Improve scalability of workqueue watchdog touch - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9d08fce64dd77f42e2361a4818dbc4b50f3c7dad", "ref_desc": "workqueue: Improve scalability of workqueue watchdog touch - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/da5f374103a1e0881bbd35847dc57b04ac155eb0", "ref_desc": "workqueue: Improve scalability of workqueue watchdog touch - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/241bce1c757d0587721512296952e6bba69631ed", "ref_desc": "workqueue: Improve scalability of workqueue watchdog touch - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
