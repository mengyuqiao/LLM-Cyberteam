{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-46986", "Description": "Camaleon CMS is a dynamic and advanced content management system based on Ruby on Rails. An arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the upload method of the MediaController allows authenticated users to write arbitrary files to any location on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the permissions of the underlying filesystem). E.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution in case an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the config/initializers/ subfolder of the Ruby on Rails application. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46986", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nTuzitio\u00bbCamaleon CmsVersions  before (<) 2.8.2cpe:2.3:a:tuzitio:camaleon_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-01  0.09%  3.45%  +3.36 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.05%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/security/advisories/GHSA-wmjg-vqhv-q5p5", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary file write to RCE (GHSL-2024-182) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 owen2345/camaleon-cms \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1exwtdm/camaleon_cms_281_has_been_released", "ref_desc": "PatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Gs2fww-urkJXMTS2FIQMAiKGzkU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/ruby/rb-path-injection", "ref_desc": "Uncontrolled data used in path expression \u2014 CodeQL query help documentationThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qmH488jWteo61KuPJ10WD1mo_74.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal | OWASP FoundationIssue TrackingCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wUjLVV38sp63juR2YRnNioHDy10.html"}]}
