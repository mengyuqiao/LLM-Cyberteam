{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-46989", "Description": "spicedb is an Open Source, Google Zanzibar-inspired permissions database to enable fine-grained authorization for customer applications. Multiple caveats over the same indirect subject type on the same relation can result in no permission being returned when permission is expected. If the resource has multiple groups, and each group is caveated, it is possible for the returned permission to be \"no permission\" when permission is expected. Permission is returned as NO_PERMISSION when PERMISSION is expected on the CheckPermission API. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.35.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use caveats or avoid the use of caveats on an indirect subject type with multiple entries.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46989", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-jhg6-6qrx-38mr", "ref_desc": "Multiple caveats on resources of the same type can result in no permission when permission is expected \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/d4ef8e1dbce1eafaf25847f4c0f09738820f5bf2", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2027 from josephschorr/caveat-check-fix \u00b7 authzed/spicedb@d4ef8e1 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
