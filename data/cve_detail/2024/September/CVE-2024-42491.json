{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42491", "Description": "Asterisk is an open-source private branch exchange (PBX). Prior to versions 18.24.3, 20.9.3, and 21.4.3 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert12 and 20.7-cert2 of certified-asterisk, if Asterisk attempts to send a SIP request to a URI whose host portion starts with `.1` or `[.1]`, and res_resolver_unbound is loaded, Asterisk will crash with a SEGV. To receive a patch, users should upgrade to one of the following versions: 18.24.3, 20.9.3, 21.4.3, certified-18.9-cert12, certified-20.7-cert2. Two workarounds are available. Disable res_resolver_unbound by setting `noload = res_resolver_unbound.so` in modules.conf, or set `rewrite_contact = yes` on all PJSIP endpoints. NOTE: This may not be appropriate for all Asterisk configurations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42491", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-252 Unchecked Return Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/252/Unchecked-Return-Value.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/7a0090325bfa9d778a39ae5f7d0a98109e4651c8", "ref_desc": "manager.c: Add entries to Originate blacklist \u00b7 asterisk/asterisk@7a00903 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9bGjfdyuH8PXiVgYHbBAhPyjXUo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/50bf8d4d3064930d28ecf1ce3397b14574d514d2", "ref_desc": "res_resolver_unbound: Test for NULL ub_result in unbound_resolver_cal\u2026 \u00b7 asterisk/asterisk@50bf8d4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/4f01669c7c41c9184f3cce9a3cf1b2ebf6201742", "ref_desc": "res_resolver_unbound: Test for NULL ub_result in unbound_resolver_cal\u2026 \u00b7 asterisk/asterisk@4f01669 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/a15050650abf09c10a3c135fab148220cd41d3a0", "ref_desc": "res_resolver_unbound: Test for NULL ub_result in unbound_resolver_cal\u2026 \u00b7 asterisk/asterisk@a150506 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/42a2f4ccfa2c7062a15063e765916b3332e34cc4", "ref_desc": "manager.c: Add entries to Originate blacklist \u00b7 asterisk/asterisk@42a2f4c \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sK0OEQEpAHUFZ4psj3sFtqCmDmk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-v428-g3cw-7hv9", "ref_desc": "A malformed Contact or Record-Route URI in an incoming SIP request can cause Asterisk to crash when res_resolver_unbound is used \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 asterisk/asterisk \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
