{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45044", "Description": "Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating systems. When a command ACL is in place and a user executes a command in bconsole using an abbreviation (i.e. \"w\" for \"whoami\") the ACL check did not apply to the full form (i.e. \"whoami\") but to the abbreviated form (i.e. \"w\"). If the command ACL is configured with negative ACL that should forbid using the \"whoami\" command, you could still use \"w\" or \"who\" as a command successfully. Fixes for the problem are shipped in Bareos versions 23.0.4, 22.1.6 and 21.1.11. If only positive command ACLs are used without any negation, the problem does not occur.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45044", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bareos/bareos/pull/1875", "ref_desc": "Fix multiple ACL handling bugs by joergsteffens \u00b7 Pull Request #1875 \u00b7 bareos/bareos \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bareos/bareos/commit/2a026698b87d13bd1c6275726b5e826702f81dd5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #1875 \u00b7 bareos/bareos@2a02669 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bareos/bareos/security/advisories/GHSA-jfww-q346-r2r8", "ref_desc": "Negative command ACLs can be circumvented by abbreviating commands \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bareos/bareos \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
