{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45159", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.x before 3.6.1. With TLS 1.3, when a server enables optional authentication of the client, if the client-provided certificate does not have appropriate values in if keyUsage or extKeyUsage extensions, then the return value of mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly have the MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE and MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE bits clear. As a result, an attacker that had a certificate valid for uses other than TLS client authentication would nonetheless be able to use it for TLS client authentication. Only TLS 1.3 servers were affected, and only with optional authentication (with required authentication, the handshake would be aborted with a fatal alert).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45159", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nARM\u00bbMbed TlsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.6.1cpe:2.3:a:arm:mbed_tls:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nARM\u00bbMbed TlsVersions  from including (>=) 3.0andbefore (<) 3.6.1cpe:2.3:a:arm:mbed_tls:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-20  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2024-08-3/", "ref_desc": "Limited authentication bypass in TLS 1.3 optional client authentication \u2014 Mbed TLS documentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 Mbed-TLS/mbedtlsRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uT7cHFmsYdOykojbkWtPVH6uRuc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-advisories/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories \u2014 Mbed TLS documentationIssue TrackingCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VqndsXcHBQEA_DQziFFirFiaspI.html"}]}
