{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45294", "Description": "The HL7 FHIR Core Artifacts repository provides the java core object handling code, with utilities (including validator), for the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification. Prior to version 6.3.23, XSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. This issue has been patched in release 6.3.23. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45294", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/security/advisories/GHSA-59rq-22fm-x8q5", "ref_desc": "XXE vulnerability in XSLT transforms in `org.hl7.fhir.publisher` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 HL7/fhir-ig-publisher \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/releases/tag/1.6.22", "ref_desc": "Release 1.6.22 \u00b7 HL7/fhir-ig-publisher \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/security/advisories/GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf", "ref_desc": "XXE vulnerability in XSLT transforms in `org.hl7.fhir.core` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lcujnGH-mqIiKbitm6H7cZoHdUA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/releases/tag/6.3.23", "ref_desc": "Release 6.3.23 \u00b7 hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
