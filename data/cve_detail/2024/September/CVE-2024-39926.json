{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39926", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) or, due to the default CSP, HTML injection vulnerability has been discovered in the admin dashboard. This potentially allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious code into the dashboard, which is then executed or rendered in the context of an administrator's browser when viewing the injected content. However, it is important to note that the default Content Security Policy (CSP) of the application blocks most exploitation paths, significantly mitigating the potential impact.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39926", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/blob/1.30.3/src/static/scripts/admin_users.js#L201", "ref_desc": "vaultwarden/src/static/scripts/admin_users.js at 1.30.3 \u00b7 dani-garcia/vaultwarden \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/releases/tag/1.32.0", "ref_desc": "Release 1.32.0 \u00b7 dani-garcia/vaultwarden \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xfWyRrHv39gnMTDK1xHWSEQoqoE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mgm-sp.com/cve/html-injection-in-vaultwarden", "ref_desc": "HTML Injection in Vaultwarden \u2014 mgm-sp", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
