{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45537", "Description": "Apache Druid allows users with certain permissions to read data from other database systems using JDBC. This functionality allows trusted users to set up Druid lookups or run ingestion tasks. Druid also allows administrators to configure a list of allowed properties that users are able to provide for their JDBC connections. By default, this allowed properties list restricts users to TLS-related properties only. However, when configuration a MySQL JDBC connection, users can use a particularly-crafted JDBC connection string to provide properties that are not on this allow list.\n\nUsers without the permission to configure JDBC connections are not able to exploit this vulnerability.\nCVE-2021-26919 describes a similar vulnerability which was partially addressed in Apache Druid 0.20.2.\n\nThis issue is fixed in Apache Druid 30.0.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45537", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbDruidVersions  before (<) 30.0.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:druid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-19  0.06%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-10-02  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/2ovx1t77y6tlkhk5b42clp4vwo4c8cjv", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-45537: Apache Druid: Users can provide MySQL JDBC properties not on allow list-Apache Mail ArchivesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
