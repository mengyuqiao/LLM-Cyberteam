{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45158", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.6 before 3.6.1. A stack buffer overflow in mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw() and mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der() can occur when the bits parameter is larger than the largest supported curve. In some configurations with PSA disabled, all values of bits are affected. (This never happens in internal library calls, but can affect applications that call these functions directly.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45158", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nARM\u00bbMbed TlsVersions  from including (>=) 3.0andbefore (<) 3.6.1cpe:2.3:a:arm:mbed_tls:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2024-08-2/", "ref_desc": "Stack buffer overflow in ECDSA signature conversion functions \u2014 Mbed TLS documentation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 Mbed-TLS/mbedtlsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uT7cHFmsYdOykojbkWtPVH6uRuc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-advisories/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories \u2014 Mbed TLS documentationCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VqndsXcHBQEA_DQziFFirFiaspI.html"}]}
