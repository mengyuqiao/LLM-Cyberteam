These keys are not uniquely generated per installation of the software. Combined with the encrypted password that can be obtained from \"WebAPI.cfg.xml\" in CVE-2024-39341, the decryption is trivial and can lead to privilege escalation on the Windows host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39342", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/VAMorales/21a8700a67d80c263b38e693fd528313", "ref_desc": "Instant Financial Issuance (On Premise) Software (formerly CardWizard) - Sensitive Information Disclosure (CVE-2024-39341) / Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys (CVE-2024-39342) \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2FbcinrnZ5Ami3noHR5p6-12Ar8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://trustedcare.entrust.com/login", "ref_desc": "Log In Using | TrustedCareCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DO9YyWe9dq6qAddCTQG-7PYfyAw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.entrust.com/", "ref_desc": "Just a moment...CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GnSHApGRcrN3Ju5h8PAQ6cM2OVU.html"}]}
