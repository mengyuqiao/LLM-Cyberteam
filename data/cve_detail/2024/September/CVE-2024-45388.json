{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45388", "Description": "Hoverfly is a lightweight service virtualization/ API simulation / API mocking tool for developers and testers. The `/api/v2/simulation` POST handler allows users to create new simulation views from the contents of a user-specified file. This feature can be abused by an attacker to read arbitrary files from the Hoverfly server. Note that, although the code prevents absolute paths from being specified, an attacker can escape out of the `hf.Cfg.ResponsesBodyFilesPath` base path by using `../` segments and reach any arbitrary files. This issue was found using the Uncontrolled data used in path expression CodeQL query for python. Users are advised to make sure the final path (`filepath.Join(hf.Cfg.ResponsesBodyFilesPath, filePath)`) is contained within the expected base path (`filepath.Join(hf.Cfg.ResponsesBodyFilesPath, \"/\")`). This issue is also tracked as GHSL-2023-274.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45388", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSpectolabs\u00bbHoverflyVersions  before (<) 1.10.3cpe:2.3:a:spectolabs:hoverfly:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHoverfly\u00bbHoverflyVersions  before (<) 1.10.3cpe:2.3:a:hoverfly:hoverfly:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-20  0.07%  0.62%  +0.55 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-09-09  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/releases/tag/v1.10.3", "ref_desc": "Release v1.10.3 \u00b7 SpectoLabs/hoverfly \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/spectolabs/hoverfly/blob/15d6ee9ea4e0de67aec5a41c28d21dc147243da0/core/handlers/v2/simulation_handler.go#L87", "ref_desc": "hoverfly/core/handlers/v2/simulation_handler.go at 15d6ee9ea4e0de67aec5a41c28d21dc147243da0 \u00b7 SpectoLabs/hoverfly \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/security/advisories/GHSA-6xx4-x46f-f897", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary file read in the `/api/v2/simulation` endpoint (`GHSL-2023-274`) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 SpectoLabs/hoverfly \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/go/go-path-injection", "ref_desc": "Uncontrolled data used in path expression \u2014 CodeQL query help documentationNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
