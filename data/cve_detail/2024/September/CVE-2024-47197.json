We expect that on many developer machines, this also contains\ncredentials.\n\nWhen the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of\nthe final artifact.\n\nIf a developer were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether as a release\nor a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47197", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbMaven Archetype PluginVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.1andbefore (<) 3.3.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:maven_archetype_plugin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbMaven Archetype\u00bbVersion:3.2.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:maven_archetype:3.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-03  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-922 Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/922/Insecure-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/ftg81np183wnyk0kg4ks95dvgxdrof96", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-47197: Maven Archetype Plugin: Maven Archetype integration-test may package local settings into the published artifact, possibly containing credentials-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
