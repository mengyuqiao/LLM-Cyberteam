{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47121", "Description": "The goTenna Pro App uses a weak password for sharing encryption keys via\n the key broadcast method. If the broadcasted encryption key is captured\n over RF, and password is cracked via brute force attack, it is possible\n to decrypt it and use it to decrypt all future and past messages sent \nvia encrypted broadcast with that particular key. This only applies when\n the key is broadcasted over RF. This is an optional feature, so it is \nrecommended to use local QR encryption key sharing for additional \nsecurity on this and previous versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47121", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGotenna\u00bbPro App\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.6.1cpe:2.3:a:gotenna:pro_app:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions\nGotenna\u00bbPro App\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.6.1cpe:2.3:a:gotenna:pro_app:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions\nGotenna\u00bbGotenna Pro\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:gotenna:gotenna_pro:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions\nGotenna\u00bbGotenna Pro\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:gotenna:gotenna_pro:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-270-04", "ref_desc": "goTenna Pro X and Pro X2 | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/J88BB3tz4S2RbEB0ruyLaOrZOaE.html"}]}
