{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45394", "Description": "Authenticator is a browser extension that generates two-step verification codes. In versions 7.0.0 and below, encryption keys for user data were stored encrypted at-rest using only AES-256 and the EVP_BytesToKey KDF. Therefore, attackers with a copy of a user's data are able to brute-force the user's encryption key. Users on version 8.0.0 and above are automatically migrated away from the weak encoding on first login. Users should destroy encrypted backups made with versions prior to 8.0.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45394", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAuthenticator-extension\u00bbAuthenticatorVersions  before (<) 8.0.0cpe:2.3:a:authenticator-extension:authenticator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAuthenticator\u00bbAuthenticatorVersions  before (<) 8.0.0cpe:2.3:a:authenticator:authenticator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-261 Weak Encoding for Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/261/Weak-Encoding-for-Password.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Authenticator-Extension/Authenticator/commit/17aa2068553db3c3aac081c9ffe393536f33b28b", "ref_desc": "Fully encrypt account data in all storage mediums \u00b7 Authenticator-Extension/Authenticator@17aa206 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Authenticator-Extension/Authenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-gv8m-vgp8-q2xr", "ref_desc": "Secret encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Authenticator-Extension/Authenticator \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
