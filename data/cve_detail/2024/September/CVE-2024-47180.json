{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47180", "Description": "Shields.io is a service for concise, consistent, and legible badges in SVG and raster format. Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version < `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47180", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/10551", "ref_desc": "[dynamicjson dynamicyaml dynamictoml] switch to jsonpath-plus by chris48s \u00b7 Pull Request #10551 \u00b7 badges/shields \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/badges/shields/security/advisories/GHSA-rxvx-x284-4445", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Dynamic JSON/TOML/YAML badges \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 badges/shields \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/10553", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Dynamic JSON/TOML/YAML badges \u00b7 Issue #10553 \u00b7 badges/shields \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/badges/shields/commit/ec1b6c8daccda075403c1688ac02603f7aaa50b2", "ref_desc": "[dynamicjson dynamicyaml dynamictoml] switch to jsonpath-plus (#10551) \u00b7 badges/shields@ec1b6c8 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
