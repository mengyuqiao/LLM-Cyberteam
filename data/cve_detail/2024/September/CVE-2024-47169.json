{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47169", "Description": "Agnai is an artificial-intelligence-agnostic multi-user, mult-bot roleplaying chat system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.330 permits attackers to upload arbitrary files to attacker-chosen locations on the server, including JavaScript, enabling the execution of commands within those files. This issue could result in unauthorized access, full server compromise, data leakage, and other critical security threats. This does not affect `agnai.chat`, installations using S3-compatible storage, or self-hosting that is not publicly exposed. This does affect publicly hosted installs without S3-compatible storage. Version 1.0.330 fixes this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47169", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nAgnai\u00bbAgnaiVersions  before (<) 1.0.330cpe:2.3:a:agnai:agnai:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-31  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-35 Path Traversal: '.../...//'", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/35/Path-Traversal-...-...-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai/security/advisories/GHSA-mpch-89gm-hm83", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via JS Upload using Directory Traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 agnaistic/agnai \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
