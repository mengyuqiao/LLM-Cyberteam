{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45613", "Description": "CKEditor 5 is a JavaScript rich-text editor. Starting in version 40.0.0 and prior to version 43.1.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration. This vulnerability only affects installations where the Block Toolbar plugin is enabled and either the General HTML Support (with a configuration that permits unsafe markup) or the HTML Embed plugin is also enabled. A fix for the problem is available in version 43.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the block toolbar plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45613", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCkeditor\u00bbCkeditor5Versions  from including (>=) 40.0.0andbefore (<) 43.1.1cpe:2.3:a:ckeditor:ckeditor5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v", "ref_desc": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) in the clipboard package \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ckeditor/ckeditor5 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/releases/tag/v43.1.1", "ref_desc": "Release v43.1.1 \u00b7 ckeditor/ckeditor5 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
