{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45311", "Description": "Quinn is a pure-Rust, async-compatible implementation of the IETF QUIC transport protocol. As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to `accept()`, `retry()`, `refuse()`, or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received. This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45311", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nQuinn Project\u00bbQuinn\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.11.0andbefore (<) 0.11.4cpe:2.3:a:quinn_project:quinn:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nQuinn Project\u00bbQuinn\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.11.0andbefore (<) 0.11.7cpe:2.3:a:quinn_project:quinn:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/commit/e01609ccd8738bd438d86fa7185a0f85598cb58f", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 quinn-rs/quinn@e01609c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/security/advisories/GHSA-vr26-jcq5-fjj8", "ref_desc": "Denial of service in quinn-proto when using `Endpoint::retry()` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 quinn-rs/quinn \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/blob/bb02a12a8435a7732a1d762783eeacbb7e50418e/quinn-proto/src/endpoint.rs#L213", "ref_desc": "quinn/quinn-proto/src/endpoint.rs at bb02a12a8435a7732a1d762783eeacbb7e50418e \u00b7 quinn-rs/quinn \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
