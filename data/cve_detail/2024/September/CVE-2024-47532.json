{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47532", "Description": "RestrictedPython is a restricted execution environment for Python to run untrusted code. A user can gain access to protected (and potentially sensible) information indirectly via AttributeError.obj and the string module. The problem will be fixed in version 7.3. As a workaround, If the application does not require access to the module string, it can remove it from RestrictedPython.Utilities.utility_builtins or otherwise do not make it available in the restricted execution environment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47532", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZope\u00bbRestrictedpythonVersions  before (<) 7.3cpe:2.3:a:zope:restrictedpython:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/security/advisories/GHSA-5rfv-66g4-jr8h", "ref_desc": "Information leakage via `AttributeError.obj` and the `string` module \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/RestrictedPython \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/commit/d701cc36cccac36b21fa200f1f2d1945a9a215e6", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 zopefoundation/RestrictedPython@d701cc3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
