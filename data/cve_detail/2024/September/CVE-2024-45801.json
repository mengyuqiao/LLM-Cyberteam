{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45801", "Description": "DOMPurify is a DOM-only, super-fast, uber-tolerant XSS sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG. It has been discovered that malicious HTML using special nesting techniques can bypass the depth checking added to DOMPurify in recent releases. It was also possible to use Prototype Pollution to weaken the depth check. This renders dompurify unable to avoid cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 of DOMPurify. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45801", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/1e520262bf4c66b5efda49e2316d6d1246ca7b21", "ref_desc": "fix: Hardened the depth tracking code against prototype pollution \u00b7 cure53/DOMPurify@1e52026 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/security/advisories/GHSA-mmhx-hmjr-r674", "ref_desc": "Tampering by prototype polution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cure53/DOMPurify \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/26e1d69ca7f769f5c558619d644d90dd8bf26ebc", "ref_desc": "fix: Merged prototype pollution check into 2.x \u00b7 cure53/DOMPurify@26e1d69 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
