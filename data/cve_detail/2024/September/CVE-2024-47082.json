{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47082", "Description": "Strawberry GraphQL is a library for creating GraphQL APIs. Prior to version 0.243.0, multipart file upload support as defined in the GraphQL multipart request specification was enabled by default in all Strawberry HTTP view integrations. This made all Strawberry HTTP view integrations vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks if users did not explicitly enable CSRF preventing security mechanism for their servers. Additionally, the Django HTTP view integration, in particular, had an exemption for Django's built-in CSRF protection (i.e., the `CsrfViewMiddleware` middleware) by default. In affect, all Strawberry integrations were vulnerable to CSRF attacks by default. Version `v0.243.0` is the first `strawberry-graphql` including a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47082", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nStrawberryrocks\u00bbStrawberryVersions  before (<) 0.243.0cpe:2.3:a:strawberryrocks:strawberry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/commit/37265b230e511480a9ceace492f9f6a484be1387", "ref_desc": "Disable multipart uploads by default (#3645) \u00b7 strawberry-graphql/strawberry@37265b2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/security/advisories/GHSA-79gp-q4wv-33fr", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in strawberry-graphql \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 strawberry-graphql/strawberry \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://strawberry.rocks/docs/breaking-changes/0.243.0", "ref_desc": "0.243.0 Breaking Changes | \ud83c\udf53 Strawberry GraphQLRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
