{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-43099", "Description": "The session hijacking attack targets the application layer's control mechanism, which manages authenticated sessions between a host PC and a PLC. During such sessions, a session key is utilized to maintain security. However, if an attacker captures this session key, they can inject traffic into an ongoing authenticated session. To successfully achieve this, the attacker also needs to spoof both the IP address and MAC address of the originating host which is typical of a session-based attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43099", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-256-17", "ref_desc": "AutomationDirect DirectLogic H2-DM1E | CISACVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/veiVoSrePie5uEMXQ2Z9_McrTvE.html"}]}
