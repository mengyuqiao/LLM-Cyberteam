{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42483", "Description": "ESP-NOW Component provides a connectionless Wi-Fi communication protocol. An replay attacks vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW because the caches is not differentiated by message types, it is a single, shared resource for all kinds of messages, whether they are broadcast or unicast, and regardless of whether they are ciphertext or plaintext. This can result an attacker to clear the cache of its legitimate entries, there by creating an opportunity to re-inject previously captured packets. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42483", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEspressif\u00bbEsp-nowVersions  before (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:espressif:esp-now:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEspressif\u00bbEsp-nowVersions  before (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:espressif:esp-now:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-349 Acceptance of Extraneous Untrusted Data With Trusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/349/Acceptance-of-Extraneous-Untrusted-Data-With-Trusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-now/commit/4e30db50d541b2909d278ef0db05de1a3d7190ef", "ref_desc": "Storage cleartext and ciphertext use separated caches \u00b7 espressif/esp-now@4e30db5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-now/security/advisories/GHSA-wf6q-c2xr-77xj", "ref_desc": "Replay Attacks Vulnerability In ESP-NOW \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 espressif/esp-now \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
