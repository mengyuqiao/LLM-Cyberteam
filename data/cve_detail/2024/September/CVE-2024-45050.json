This allows any user with a Lif Account to load any conversation between two users without permission. This issue had been patched in version 1.3.1. There is no action required for users. Lif Platforms will update their servers with the patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45050", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Lif-Platforms/New-Ringer-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-cpc7-79cg-qv65", "ref_desc": "Ringer Server Does Not Check Members When Loading Messages \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Lif-Platforms/New-Ringer-Server \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Lif-Platforms/New-Ringer-Server/commit/ae795ff47b2ac2656ac6a099a0e7954ca7d9ba53", "ref_desc": "Fix message loading security issue \u00b7 Lif-Platforms/New-Ringer-Server@ae795ff \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
