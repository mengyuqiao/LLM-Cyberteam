{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45407", "Description": "Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Clients that experience a MITM attack during the pairing process may inadvertantly allow access to an unintended client rather than failing authentication due to a PIN validation error. The pairing attempt fails due to the incorrect PIN, but the certificate from the forged pairing attempt is incorrectly persisted prior to the completion of the pairing request. This allows access to the certificate belonging to the attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45407", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLizardbyte\u00bbSunshine\u00bbVersion:cpe:2.3:a:lizardbyte:sunshine:0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLizardbyte\u00bbSunshine\u00bbVersion:2024-05-27cpe:2.3:a:lizardbyte:sunshine:2024-05-27:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-300 Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/300/Channel-Accessible-by-Non-Endpoint.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/security/advisories/GHSA-jqph-8cp5-g874", "ref_desc": "Incorrect state management during pairing process may lead to incorrectly authorized client \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 LizardByte/Sunshine \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/commit/5fcd07ecb1428bfe245ad6fa349aead476c7e772", "ref_desc": "Name and unpair individual clients (#2042) \u00b7 LizardByte/Sunshine@5fcd07e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/commit/fd7e68457a134102d1b30af5796c79f2aa623224", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 LizardByte/Sunshine@fd7e684 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
