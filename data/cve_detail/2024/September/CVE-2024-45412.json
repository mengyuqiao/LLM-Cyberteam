{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45412", "Description": "Yeti bridges the gap between CTI and DFIR practitioners by providing a Forensics Intelligence platform and pipeline. Remote user-controlled data tags can reach a Unicode normalization with a compatibility form NFKD. Under Windows, such normalization is costly in resources and may lead to denial of service with attacks such as One Million Unicode payload. This can get worse with the use of special Unicode characters like U+2100 (?), or U+2105 (?) which could lead the payload size to be tripled. Versions prior to 2.1.11 are affected by this vulnerability. The patch is included in 2.1.11.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45412", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nYeti-platform\u00bbYetiVersions  before (<) 2.1.11cpe:2.3:a:yeti-platform:yeti:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/2258758", "ref_desc": "HackerOneExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti/security/advisories/GHSA-cwwm-pq9x-2cxv", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-45412: Potential Denial of Service due to the One Milion Unicode characters attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yeti-platform/yeti \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti/commit/f1f0082e7c165f148ae95f4deeb2786404797a39", "ref_desc": "Add max length to tags (#1132) \u00b7 yeti-platform/yeti@f1f0082 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
