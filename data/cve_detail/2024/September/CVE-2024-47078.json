{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47078", "Description": "Meshtastic is an open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network. Meshtastic uses MQTT to communicate over an internet connection to a shared or private MQTT Server. Nodes can communicate directly via an internet connection or proxied through a connected phone (i.e., via bluetooth). Prior to version 2.5.1, multiple weaknesses in the MQTT implementation allow for authentication and authorization bypasses resulting in unauthorized control of MQTT-connected nodes. Version 2.5.1 contains a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47078", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMeshtastic\u00bbFirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.5.1cpe:2.3:a:meshtastic:firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMeshtastic\u00bbMeshtastic FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.5.1cpe:2.3:a:meshtastic:meshtastic_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-02  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/security/advisories/GHSA-vqcq-wjwx-7252", "ref_desc": "Authentication/Authorization Bypass via MQTT \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 meshtastic/firmware \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
