{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47077", "Description": "authentik is an open-source identity provider. Prior to versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5, access tokens issued to one application can be stolen by that application and used to impersonate the user against any other proxy provider. Also, a user can steal an access token they were legitimately issued for one application and use it to access another application that they aren't allowed to access. Anyone who has more than one proxy provider application with different trust domains or different access control is affected. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47077", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/70b5a214f2e7205572f914aaf68682501b9f5945/internal/outpost/proxyv2/application/auth_bearer.go#L30-L36", "ref_desc": "authentik/internal/outpost/proxyv2/application/auth_bearer.go at 70b5a214f2e7205572f914aaf68682501b9f5945 \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/57a31b5dd16d4adce716b9878455c0d6f58155fe", "ref_desc": "security: fix CVE-2024-47077 (cherry-pick #11535) (#11537) \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik@57a31b5 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/70b5a214f2e7205572f914aaf68682501b9f5945/authentik/providers/oauth2/views/introspection.py#L42-L51", "ref_desc": "authentik/authentik/providers/oauth2/views/introspection.py at 70b5a214f2e7205572f914aaf68682501b9f5945 \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-8gfm-pr6x-pfh9", "ref_desc": "Insufficient cross-provider token validation during introspection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/22e586bd8cdc3d1db8a0f18314d76f82371129b2", "ref_desc": "security: fix CVE-2024-47077 (cherry-pick #11535) (#11538) \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik@22e586b \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
