{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45393", "Description": "Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. An attacker with a CVAT account can access webhook delivery information for any webhook registered on the CVAT instance, including that of other users. For each delivery, this contains information about the event that caused the delivery, typically including full details about the object on which an action was performed (such as the task for an \"update:task\" event), and the user who performed the action. In addition, the attacker can redeliver any past delivery of any webhook, and trigger a ping event for any webhook. Upgrade to CVAT 2.18.0 or any later version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45393", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/0fafb797fdf022fb83ce81c6405ba19b583a236f", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 cvat-ai/cvat@0fafb79 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/security/advisories/GHSA-p3c9-m7jr-jxxj", "ref_desc": "Missing authorization for endpoints related to webhook deliveries \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cvat-ai/cvat \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
