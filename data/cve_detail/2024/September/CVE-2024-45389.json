{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45389", "Description": "Pagefind, a fully static search library, initializes its dynamic JavaScript and WebAssembly files relative to the location of the first script the user loads. This information is gathered by looking up the value of `document.currentScript.src`. Prior to Pagefind version 1.1.1, it is possible to \"clobber\" this lookup with otherwise benign HTML on the page. This will cause `document.currentScript.src` to resolve as an external domain, which will then be used by Pagefind to load dependencies. This exploit would only work in the case that an attacker could inject HTML to a live, hosted, website. In these cases, this would act as a way to escalate the privilege available to an attacker. This assumes they have the ability to add some elements to the page (for example, `img` tags with a `name` attribute), but not others, as adding a `script` to the page would itself be the cross-site scripting vector. Pagefind has tightened this resolution in version 1.1.1 by ensuring the source is loaded from a valid script element. There are no reports of this being exploited in the wild via Pagefind.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45389", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCloudcannon\u00bbPagefindVersions  before (<) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:cloudcannon:pagefind:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCloudcannon\u00bbPagefinderVersions  before (<) 1.1cpe:2.3:a:cloudcannon:pagefinder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-13  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/commit/14ec96864eabaf1d7d809d5da0186a8856261eeb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #696 from CloudCannon/fix/dom-clobber \u00b7 CloudCannon/pagefind@14ec968 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986", "ref_desc": "DOM Clobbering Gadget found in Webpack's AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule that leads to XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 webpack/webpack \u00b7 GitHubNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eE_cf-di24Cqz-cLXIIQ4qjCkds.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/security/advisories/GHSA-gprj-6m2f-j9hx", "ref_desc": "DOM clobbering could escalate to XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CloudCannon/pagefind \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
