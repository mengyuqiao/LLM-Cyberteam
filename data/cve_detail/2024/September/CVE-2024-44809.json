{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-44809", "Description": "A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the Pi Camera project, version 1.0, maintained by RECANTHA. The issue arises from improper sanitization of user input passed to the \"position\" GET parameter in the tilt.php script. An attacker can exploit this by sending crafted input data that includes malicious command sequences, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This vulnerability is exploitable remotely and poses significant risk if the application is exposed to untrusted networks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-44809", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/recantha/camera-pi/blob/ef018d212288cb16404f0b050593d20f0dc0467b/www/tilt.php#L4", "ref_desc": "camera-pi/www/tilt.php at ef018d212288cb16404f0b050593d20f0dc0467b \u00b7 recantha/camera-pi \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jacobmasse.medium.com/cve-2024-44809-remote-code-execution-in-raspberry-pi-camera-project-4b8e3486a628", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024\u201344809: Remote Code Execution in Raspberry Pi Camera Project | by Jacob Masse | Aug, 2024 | Medium", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
