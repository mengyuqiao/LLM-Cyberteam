{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-46754", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Remove tst_run from lwt_seg6local_prog_ops.\n\nThe syzbot reported that the lwt_seg6 related BPF ops can be invoked\nvia bpf_test_run() without without entering input_action_end_bpf()\nfirst.\n\nMartin KaFai Lau said that self test for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL\nprobably didn't work since it was introduced in commit 04d4b274e2a\n(\"ipv6: sr: Add seg6local action End.BPF\"). The reason is that the\nper-CPU variable seg6_bpf_srh_states::srh is never assigned in the self\ntest case but each BPF function expects it.\n\nRemove test_run for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46754", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9cd15511de7c619bbd0f54bb3f28e6e720ded5d6", "ref_desc": "bpf: Remove tst_run from lwt_seg6local_prog_ops. - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c13fda93aca118b8e5cd202e339046728ee7dddb", "ref_desc": "bpf: Remove tst_run from lwt_seg6local_prog_ops. - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
