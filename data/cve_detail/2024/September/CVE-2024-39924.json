{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39924", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. A vulnerability has been identified in the authentication and authorization process of the endpoint responsible for altering the metadata of an emergency access. It permits an attacker with granted emergency access to escalate their privileges by changing the access level and modifying the wait time. Consequently, the attacker can gain full control over the vault (when only intended to have read access) while bypassing the necessary wait period.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39924", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.mgm-sp.com/cve/missing-authentication-check-for-emergency-access", "ref_desc": "Missing authentication check for emergency access \u2014 mgm-sp", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/blob/1.30.3/src/api/core/emergency_access.rs#L115-L148", "ref_desc": "vaultwarden/src/api/core/emergency_access.rs at 1.30.3 \u00b7 dani-garcia/vaultwarden \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/releases/tag/1.32.0", "ref_desc": "Release 1.32.0 \u00b7 dani-garcia/vaultwarden \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xfWyRrHv39gnMTDK1xHWSEQoqoE.html"}]}
