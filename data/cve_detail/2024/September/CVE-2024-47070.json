{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47070", "Description": "authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47070", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-7jxf-mmg9-9hg7", "ref_desc": "Password authentication bypass via X-Forwarded-For HTTP header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/dd8f809161e738b25765797eb2a5c77a7d3fc2cf", "ref_desc": "security: fix CVE-2024-47070 (cherry-pick #11536) (#11539) \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik@dd8f809 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/78f7b04d5a62b2a9d4316282a713c2c7857dbe29", "ref_desc": "security: fix CVE-2024-47070 (cherry-pick #11536) (#11540) \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik@78f7b04 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
