{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47064", "Description": "Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. If an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a maliciously-constructed URL, they can initiate any API calls on that user's behalf. This gives the attacker temporary access to all data that the victim user has access to. Upgrade to CVAT 2.19.0 or a later version to fix this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47064", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCvat\u00bbCvatVersions  from including (>=) 2.16.0andbefore (<) 2.19.0cpe:2.3:a:cvat:cvat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCvat\u00bbComputer Vision Annotation ToolVersions  from including (>=) 2.16.0andbefore (<) 2.19.0cpe:2.3:a:cvat:computer_vision_annotation_tool:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-31  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-81 Improper Neutralization of Script in an Error Message Web Page", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/81/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-in-an-Error-Message-Web-Pa.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/security/advisories/GHSA-hp6c-f34j-qjj7", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS via request endpoints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cvat-ai/cvat \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/0bf45fd5de08a652dffbfb517318a64c2fdbc5cf", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 cvat-ai/cvat@0bf45fd \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
