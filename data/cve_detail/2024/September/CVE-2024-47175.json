{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-47175", "Description": "CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libppd` can be used for legacy PPD file support. The `libppd` function `ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2` does not sanitize IPP attributes when creating the PPD buffer. When used in combination with other functions such as `cfGetPrinterAttributes5`, can result in user controlled input and ultimately code execution via Foomatic. This vulnerability can be part of an exploit chain leading to remote code execution (RCE), as described in CVE-2024-47176.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47175", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfx-47qg-grp6", "ref_desc": "ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2 does not sanitize IPP attributes when creating the PPD buffer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenPrinting/libppd \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2MicS2DFJFb9Z2PeBKyCLjdYykA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8", "ref_desc": "Multiple bugs leading to info leak and remote code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenPrinting/cups-browsed \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/C6Jy85kFmoqxi3sI8VUz7a8dt1k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5", "ref_desc": "cfGetPrinterAttributes5 does not validate IPP attributes returned from an IPP server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mkmBicZCX5YGaOiYSCJbt4oifo8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-p9rh-jxmq-gq47", "ref_desc": "Command injection via FoomaticRIPCommandLine \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenPrinting/cups-filters \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PjP2IlZM_13PdYDd3mjyA2u4Hgs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cups.org", "ref_desc": "CUPS.orgCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rNe9XzuaG-i0P2r5qvxL9PZLXMM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I", "ref_desc": "Attacking UNIX Systems via CUPS, Part ICVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Xt0hTOCMeSWEOxZRf3U_qmUMujw.html"}]}
