{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45596", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An unauthenticated user can access credentials of last authenticated user via OpenID or OAuth2 where the authentication URL did not include redirect query string. This happens because on that endpoint for both OpenId and Oauth2 Directus is using the respond middleware, which by default will try to cache GET requests that met some conditions. Although, those conditions do not include this scenario, when an unauthenticated request returns user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.3 and 11.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45596", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-524 Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/524/Use-of-Cache-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/4aace0bbe57232e38cd6a287ee475293e46dc91b", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 directus/directus@4aace0b \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1XGUJvhZqVC9_U1lsNq_TeMkVdw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/769fa22797bff5a9231599883b391e013f122e52", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 directus/directus@769fa22 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NJYu8VFc2VubIhG-oGGRhCe3Y14.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-cff8-x7jv-4fm8", "ref_desc": "Session is cached for OpenID and OAuth2 if `redirect` is not used \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
