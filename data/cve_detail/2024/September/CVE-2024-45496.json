{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45496", "Description": "A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platform's build process. During the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45496", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-19  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6687", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2024:6687 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0HKSxoMz9O9F-wFza59mbveOu_8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6685", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2024:6685 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3N9ZL1LeVBhcZVhG41zI4pM06JA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6705", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2024:6705 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fDxBI_xZa3qohQSQmwoui_3QcOk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6689", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2024:6689 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/i-QKPoIQ6QVVGtD7kE9ZEYjPH0c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6691", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2024:6691 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/R1fDzq_FcB_Zv8XaYz681_Sq-2s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45496", "ref_desc": "CVE-2024-45496 - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2308661", "ref_desc": "2308661 \u2013 (CVE-2024-45496) CVE-2024-45496 openshift-controller-manager: Elevated Build Pods Can Lead to Node Compromise in OpenShift", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
