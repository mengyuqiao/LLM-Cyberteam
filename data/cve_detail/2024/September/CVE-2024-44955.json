{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-44955", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Don't refer to dc_sink in is_dsc_need_re_compute\n\n[Why]\nWhen unplug one of monitors connected after mst hub, encounter null pointer dereference.\n\nIt's due to dc_sink get released immediately in early_unregister() or detect_ctx(). When\ncommit new state which directly referring to info stored in dc_sink will cause null pointer\ndereference.\n\n[how]\nRemove redundant checking condition. Relevant condition should already be covered by checking\nif dsc_aux is null or not. Also reset dsc_aux to NULL when the connector is disconnected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-44955", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.10.5cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39b217193729aa45eded8de24d9245468a0c0263", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Don't refer to dc_sink in is_dsc_need_re_compute - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fcf6a49d79923a234844b8efe830a61f3f0584e4", "ref_desc": "drm/amd/display: Don't refer to dc_sink in is_dsc_need_re_compute - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
