{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45813", "Description": "find-my-way is a fast, open source HTTP router, internally using a Radix Tree (aka compact Prefix Tree), supports route params, wildcards, and it's framework independent. A bad regular expression is generated any time one has two parameters within a single segment, when adding a `-` at the end, like `/:a-:b-`. This may cause a denial of service in some instances. Users are advised to update to find-my-way v8.2.2 or v9.0.1. or subsequent versions. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45813", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos", "ref_desc": "ReDoS the web \u2022 Blake Embrey", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/delvedor/find-my-way/commit/5e9e0eb5d8d438e06a185d5e536a896572dd0440", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 delvedor/find-my-way@5e9e0eb \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/delvedor/find-my-way/security/advisories/GHSA-rrr8-f88r-h8q6", "ref_desc": "ReDoS vulnerability in multiparametric routes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 delvedor/find-my-way \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
