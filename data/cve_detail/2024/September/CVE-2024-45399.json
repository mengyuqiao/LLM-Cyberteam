{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45399", "Description": "Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. In Indico prior to version 3.3.4, corresponding to Flask-Multipass prior to version 0.5.5, there is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability during account creation when redirecting to the `next` URL. Exploitation requires initiating the account creation process with a maliciously crafted link, and then finalizing the signup process. Because of this, it can only target newly created (and thus unprivileged) Indico users. Indico 3.3.4 upgrades the dependency on Flask-Multipass to version 0.5.5, which fixes the issue. Those who build the Indico package themselves and cannot upgrade can update the `flask-multipass` dependency to `>=0.5.5` which fixes the vulnerability. Otherwise one could configure one's web server to disallow requests containing a query string with a `next` parameter that starts with `javascript:`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45399", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCern\u00bbIndicoVersions  before (<) 3.3.4cpe:2.3:a:cern:indico:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/indico/flask-multipass/commit/0bdcf656d469e5f675cb56fd644d82fea3a97c2a", "ref_desc": "Validate scheme of next URL (#85) \u00b7 indico/flask-multipass@0bdcf65 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.3.4", "ref_desc": "Release v3.3.4 \u00b7 indico/indico \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/indico/indico/security/advisories/GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site-Scripting during account creation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 indico/indico \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/indico/indico/commit/7dcb573837b9fd09d95f74d1baeae225b164cc8f", "ref_desc": "Update flask-multipass to latest version \u00b7 indico/indico@7dcb573 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
