{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45041", "Description": "External Secrets Operator is a Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems. The external-secrets has a deployment called default-external-secrets-cert-controller, which is bound with a same-name ClusterRole. This ClusterRole has \"get/list\" verbs of secrets resources. It also has path/update verb of validatingwebhookconfigurations resources.  This can be used to abuse the SA token of the deployment to retrieve or get ALL secrets in the whole cluster, capture and log all data from requests attempting to update Secrets, or make a webhook deny all Pod create and update requests. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.10.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45041", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nExternal-secrets\u00bbExternal Secrets OperatorVersions  before (<) 0.10.2cpe:2.3:a:external-secrets:external_secrets_operator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-19  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/security/advisories/GHSA-qwgc-rr35-h4x9", "ref_desc": "A potential risk of external-secrets which can be leveraged to make a privilege escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 external-secrets/external-secrets \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/commit/428a452fd2ad45935312f2c2c0d40bc37ce6e67c", "ref_desc": "add the resourceNames(git commit -s) (#3822) \u00b7 external-secrets/external-secrets@428a452 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
