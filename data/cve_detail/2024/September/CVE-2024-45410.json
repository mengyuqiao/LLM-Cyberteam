{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45410", "Description": "Traefik is a golang, Cloud Native Application Proxy. When a HTTP request is processed by Traefik, certain HTTP headers such as X-Forwarded-Host or X-Forwarded-Port are added by Traefik before the request is routed to the application. For a HTTP client, it should not be possible to remove or modify these headers. Since the application trusts the value of these headers, security implications might arise, if they can be modified. For HTTP/1.1, however, it was found that some of theses custom headers can indeed be removed and in certain cases manipulated. The attack relies on the HTTP/1.1 behavior, that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. This issue has been addressed in release versions 2.11.9 and 3.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45410", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTraefik\u00bbTraefikVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.1.3cpe:2.3:a:traefik:traefik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTraefik\u00bbTraefikVersions  before (<) 2.11.9cpe:2.3:a:traefik:traefik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-348 Use of Less Trusted Source", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/348/Use-of-Less-Trusted-Source.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.1.3", "ref_desc": "Release v3.1.3 \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.11.9", "ref_desc": "Release v2.11.9 \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/security/advisories/GHSA-62c8-mh53-4cqv", "ref_desc": "HTTP client can remove the X-Forwarded headers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 traefik/traefik \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
