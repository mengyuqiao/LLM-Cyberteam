{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45312", "Description": "Overleaf is a web-based collaborative LaTeX editor. Overleaf Community Edition and Server Pro prior to version 5.0.7 (or 4.2.7 for the 4.x series) contain a vulnerability that allows an arbitrary language parameter in client spelling requests to be passed to the `aspell` executable running on the server.  This causes `aspell` to attempt to load  a dictionary file with an arbitrary filename. File access is limited to the scope of the overleaf server. The problem is patched in versions 5.0.7 and 4.2.7.  Previous versions can be upgraded using the Overleaf toolkit `bin/upgrade` command. Users unable to upgrade may block POST requests to `/spelling/check` via a Web Application Firewall will prevent access to the vulnerable spell check feature.  However, upgrading is advised.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45312", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOverleaf\u00bbOverleafVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.7cpe:2.3:a:overleaf:overleaf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOverleaf\u00bbOverleaf\u00bb   Server ProEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.7cpe:2.3:a:overleaf:overleaf:*:*:server_pro:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOverleaf\u00bbOverleaf\u00bb   Server ProEditionVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.7cpe:2.3:a:overleaf:overleaf:*:*:server_pro:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOverleaf\u00bbOverleaf\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.7cpe:2.3:a:overleaf:overleaf:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nOverleaf\u00bbOverleafVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.7cpe:2.3:a:overleaf:overleaf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOverleaf\u00bbOverleaf\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.7cpe:2.3:a:overleaf:overleaf:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-641 Improper Restriction of Names for Files and Other Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/641/Improper-Restriction-of-Names-for-Files-and-Other-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/commit/b5e5d39c3ad4e7763d42b837738955f8ded4dcd3", "ref_desc": "[web] Tighten check for spelling language (#19297) \u00b7 overleaf/overleaf@b5e5d39 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit", "ref_desc": "GitHub - overleaf/toolkitProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/security/advisories/GHSA-pxm4-p454-vppg", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary language parameter can passed to `aspell` executable via spelling requests \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 overleaf/overleaf \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
