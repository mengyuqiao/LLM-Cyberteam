{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45300", "Description": "alf.io is an open source ticket reservation system for conferences, trade shows, workshops, and meetups. Prior to version 2.0-M5, a race condition allows the user to bypass the limit on the number of promo codes and use the discount coupon multiple times. In \"alf.io\", an event organizer can apply price discounts by using promo codes to your events. The organizer can limit the number of promo codes that will be used for this, but the time-gap between checking the number of codes and restricting the use of the codes allows a threat actor to bypass the promo code limit. Version 2.0-M5 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45300", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpencollective\u00bbAlf.ioVersions  before (<) 2.0-m5cpe:2.3:a:opencollective:alf.io:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nALF\u00bbALFVersions  before (<) 2.0-m5cpe:2.3:a:alf:alf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/alfio-event/alf.io/security/advisories/GHSA-67jg-m6f3-473g", "ref_desc": "Bypassing promo code limitations with race conditions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 alfio-event/alf.io \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/alfio-event/alf.io/commit/53b3309e26e8acec6860d1e045df3046153a3245", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 alfio-event/alf.io@53b3309 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
