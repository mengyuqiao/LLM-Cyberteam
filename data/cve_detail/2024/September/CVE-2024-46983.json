{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-46983", "Description": "sofa-hessian is an internal improved version of Hessian3/4 powered by Ant Group CO., Ltd. The SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. This issue is fixed by an update to the blacklist, users can upgrade to sofahessian version 3.5.5 to avoid this issue. Users unable to upgrade may maintain a blacklist themselves in the directory `external/serialize.blacklist`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46983", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAntfin\u00bbSofa-hessianVersions  before (<) 3.5.5cpe:2.3:a:antfin:sofa-hessian:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSofastack\u00bbSofa-hessianVersions  before (<) 3.5.5cpe:2.3:a:sofastack:sofa-hessian:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-26  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-hessian/security/advisories/GHSA-c459-2m73-67hj", "ref_desc": "Remote Command Execution(RCE) Vulnerbility \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sofastack/sofa-hessian \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
