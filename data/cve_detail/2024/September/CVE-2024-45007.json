{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45007", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nchar: xillybus: Don't destroy workqueue from work item running on it\n\nTriggered by a kref decrement, destroy_workqueue() may be called from\nwithin a work item for destroying its own workqueue. This illegal\nsituation is averted by adding a module-global workqueue for exclusive\nuse of the offending work item. Other work items continue to be queued\non per-device workqueues to ensure performance.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45007", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "N/A", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a7ad105b12256ec7fb6d6d1a0e2e60f00b7da157", "ref_desc": "char: xillybus: Don't destroy workqueue from work item running on it - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ccbde4b128ef9c73d14d0d7817d68ef795f6d131", "ref_desc": "char: xillybus: Don't destroy workqueue from work item running on it - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aa1a19724fa2c31e97a9be48baedd4692b265157", "ref_desc": "char: xillybus: Don't destroy workqueue from work item running on it - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5d3567caff2a1d678aa40cc74a54e1318941fad3", "ref_desc": "char: xillybus: Don't destroy workqueue from work item running on it - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/409b495f8e3300d5fba08bc817fa8825dae48cc9", "ref_desc": "char: xillybus: Don't destroy workqueue from work item running on it - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable tree", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
