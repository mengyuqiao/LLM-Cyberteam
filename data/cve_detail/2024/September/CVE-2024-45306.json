{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45306", "Description": "Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Patch v9.1.0038 optimized how the cursor position is calculated and removed a loop, that verified that the cursor position always points inside a line and does not become invalid by pointing beyond the end of\na line. Back then we assumed this loop is unnecessary. However, this change made it possible that the cursor position stays invalid and points beyond the end of a line, which would eventually cause a heap-buffer-overflow when trying to access the line pointer at\nthe specified cursor position. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation that the cursor points to an invalid position. That's why patch v9.1.0707 does not include a test case. The only observed impact has been a program crash. This issue has been addressed in with the patch v9.1.0707. All users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45306", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nVIM\u00bbVIMVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.0038andbefore (<) 9.1.0707cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v9.1.0038", "ref_desc": "Release v9.1.0038 \u00b7 vim/vim \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/396fd1ec2956307755392a1", "ref_desc": "patch 9.1.0707: [security]: invalid cursor position may cause a crash \u00b7 vim/vim@396fd1e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-wxf9-c5gx-qrwr", "ref_desc": "heap-buffer-overflow in Vim >= 9.1.0038 and Vim < 9.1.0707 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vim/vim \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
