{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45614", "Description": "Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. In affected versions clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded_For). Any users relying on proxy set variables is affected. v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the non-underscore version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy defined headers to always win. Users are advised to upgrade. Nginx has a underscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard these headers at the proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting the proxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so until upgraded to the fixed versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45614", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.4.3cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 5.6.9cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-9hf4-67fc-4vf4", "ref_desc": "Header normalization allows for client to clobber proxy set headers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 puma/puma \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#underscores_in_headers", "ref_desc": "Module ngx_http_core_moduleProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
