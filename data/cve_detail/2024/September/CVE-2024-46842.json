{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-46842", "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_info\n\nThe MBX_TIMEOUT return code is not handled in lpfc_get_sfp_info and the\nroutine unconditionally frees submitted mailbox commands regardless of\nreturn status.  The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmware\nreturns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory region\nreferences previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.\n\nFix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox\nresource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not\ntimeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources\nbecause it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later\ntime in its cmpl routine.\n\nAlso, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot\nscripts requiring longer timeouts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46842", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 6.10.10cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bba47fe3b038cca3d3ebd799665ce69d6d273b58", "ref_desc": "scsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_info - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ede596b1434b57c0b3fd5c02b326efe5c54f6e48", "ref_desc": "scsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_info - kernel/git/stable/linux.git - Linux kernel stable treePatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
