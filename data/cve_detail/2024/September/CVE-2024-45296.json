{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45296", "Description": "path-to-regexp turns path strings into a regular expressions. In certain cases, path-to-regexp will output a regular expression that can be exploited to cause poor performance. Because JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and lead to a DoS. The bad regular expression is generated any time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period (.). For users of 0.1, upgrade to 0.1.10. All other users should upgrade to 8.0.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45296", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/security/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j", "ref_desc": "Backtracking regular expressions cause ReDoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pillarjs/path-to-regexp \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/60f2121e9b66b7b622cc01080df0aabda9eedee6", "ref_desc": "Rewrite and simplify API \u00b7 pillarjs/path-to-regexp@60f2121 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/29b96b4a1de52824e1ca0f49a701183cc4ed476f", "ref_desc": "Add backtrack protection to parameters \u00b7 pillarjs/path-to-regexp@29b96b4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
