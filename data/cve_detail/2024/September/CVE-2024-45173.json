{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45173", "Description": "An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Due to improper privilege management concerning sudo privileges, C-MOR is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. The Linux user www-data running the C-MOR web interface can execute some OS commands as root via Sudo without having to enter the root password. These commands, for example, include cp, chown, and chmod, which enable an attacker to modify the system's sudoers file in order to execute all commands with root privileges. Thus, it is possible to escalate the limited privileges of the user www-data to root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45173", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/mehrere-sicherheitsschwachstellen-in-videoueberwachungssoftware-c-mor-syss-2024-020-bis-030", "ref_desc": "C-MOR Video Surveillance: 11 Sicherheitsschwachstellen gefundenCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HBDqKdi0nphk_9oHoZfRV3xtyqU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2024-027.txt", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
