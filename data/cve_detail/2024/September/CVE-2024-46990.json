{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-46990", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46990", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/4aace0bbe57232e38cd6a287ee475293e46dc91b", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 directus/directus@4aace0b \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1XGUJvhZqVC9_U1lsNq_TeMkVdw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/8cbf943b65fd4a763d09a5fdbba8996b1e7797ff", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 directus/directus@8cbf943 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-68g8-c275-xf2m", "ref_desc": "SSRF Loopback IP filter bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/769fa22797bff5a9231599883b391e013f122e52", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 directus/directus@769fa22 \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NJYu8VFc2VubIhG-oGGRhCe3Y14.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/c1f3ccc681595038d094ce110ddeee38cb38f431", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 directus/directus@c1f3ccc \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
