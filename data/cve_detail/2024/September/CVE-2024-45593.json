{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45593", "Description": "Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. A bug in Nix 2.24 prior to 2.24.6 allows a substituter or malicious user to craft a NAR that, when unpacked by Nix, causes Nix to write to arbitrary file system locations to which the Nix process has access. This will be with root permissions when using the Nix daemon. This issue is fixed in Nix 2.24.6.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45593", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNixos\u00bbNIXVersions  from including (>=) 2.24.0andbefore (<) 2.24.6cpe:2.3:o:nixos:nix:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-21  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/nix/security/advisories/GHSA-h4vv-h3jq-v493", "ref_desc": "Unsafe NAR unpacking \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NixOS/nix \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/eb11c1499876cd4c9c188cbda5b1003b36ce2e59", "ref_desc": "Merge commit from fork \u00b7 NixOS/nix@eb11c14 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
