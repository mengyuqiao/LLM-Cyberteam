{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45178", "Description": "An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Due to improper user input validation, it is possible to download arbitrary files from the C-MOR system via a path traversal attack. It was found out that different functionalities are vulnerable to path traversal attacks, due to insufficient user input validation. For instance, the download functionality for backups provided by the script download-bkf.pml is vulnerable to a path traversal attack via the parameter bkf. This enables an authenticated user to download arbitrary files as Linux user www-data from the C-MOR system. Another path traversal attack is in the script show-movies.pml, which can be exploited via the parameter cam.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45178", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2024-025.txt", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/mehrere-sicherheitsschwachstellen-in-videoueberwachungssoftware-c-mor-syss-2024-020-bis-030", "ref_desc": "C-MOR Video Surveillance: 11 Sicherheitsschwachstellen gefundenCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HBDqKdi0nphk_9oHoZfRV3xtyqU.html"}]}
