{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-45374", "Description": "The goTenna Pro ATAK plugin uses a weak password for sharing encryption \nkeys via the key broadcast method. If the broadcasted encryption key is \ncaptured over RF, and password is cracked via brute force attack, it is \npossible to decrypt it and use it to decrypt all future and past \nmessages sent via encrypted broadcast with that particular key. This \nonly applies when the key is broadcasted over RF. This is an optional \nfeature, so it is advised to use local QR encryption key sharing for \nadditional security on this and previous versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45374", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGotenna\u00bbPro Atak PluginVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.9.12cpe:2.3:a:gotenna:pro_atak_plugin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGotenna\u00bbGotenna\u00bbForAtakVersions  before (<) 2.0.7cpe:2.3:a:gotenna:gotenna:*:*:*:*:*:atak:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-922 Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/922/Insecure-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-270-05", "ref_desc": "goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2ujNYjkC0Z2Umh43gjLiJaKDbE4.html"}]}
