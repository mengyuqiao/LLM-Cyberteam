{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-42484", "Description": "ESP-NOW Component provides a connectionless Wi-Fi communication protocol. An Out-of-Bound (OOB) vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW group type message because there is no check for the addrs_num field of the group type message. This can result in memory corruption related attacks. Normally there are two fields in the group information that need to be checked, i.e., the addrs_num field and the addrs_list fileld. Since we only checked the addrs_list field, an attacker can send a group type message with an invalid addrs_num field, which will cause the message handled by the firmware to be much larger than the current buffer, thus causing a memory corruption issue that goes beyond the payload length.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42484", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-now/security/advisories/GHSA-q6f6-4qc5-vhx5", "ref_desc": "OOB Vulnerability In ESP-NOW Group Type Message \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 espressif/esp-now \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-now/commit/b03a1b4593713fa4bf0038a87edca01f10114a7a", "ref_desc": "fix: The size of the data must be match with addr number for group ty\u2026 \u00b7 espressif/esp-now@b03a1b4 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
