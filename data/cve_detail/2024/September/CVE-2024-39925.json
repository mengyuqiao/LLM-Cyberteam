{"CVE Code": "CVE-2024-39925", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. It lacks an offboarding process for members who leave an organization. As a result, the shared organization key is not rotated when a member departs. Consequently, the departing member, whose access should be revoked, retains a copy of the organization key. Additionally, the application fails to adequately protect some encrypted data stored on the server. Consequently, an authenticated user could gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if the user is not a member of the targeted organization. However, the user would need to know the corresponding organizationId. Hence, if a user (whose access to an organization has been revoked) already possesses the organization key, that user could use the key to decrypt the leaked data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39925", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.mgm-sp.com/cve/missing-rotation-of-the-organization-key", "ref_desc": "Missing rotation of the organization key \u2014 mgm-sp", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 dani-garcia/vaultwarden", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/releases/tag/1.32.0", "ref_desc": "Release 1.32.0 \u00b7 dani-garcia/vaultwarden \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xfWyRrHv39gnMTDK1xHWSEQoqoE.html"}]}
