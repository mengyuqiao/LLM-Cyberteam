{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15459", "Description": "A vulnerability in the administrative web interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain additional privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper controls on certain pages in the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with an administrator account and sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create additional Admin accounts with different user roles. An attacker could then use these accounts to perform actions within their scope. The attacker would need valid Admin credentials for the device. This vulnerability cannot be exploited to add a Super Admin account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15459", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.3(0.298)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.3\\(0.298\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.5(0.1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.5\\(0.1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106707", "ref_desc": "Cisco Identity Services Engine CVE-2018-15459 Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-ise-privilege", "ref_desc": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
