{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-11788", "Description": "Apache Karaf provides a features deployer, which allows users to \"hot deploy\" a features XML by dropping the file directly in the deploy folder. The features XML is parsed by XMLInputFactory class. Apache Karaf XMLInputFactory class doesn't contain any mitigation codes against XXE. This is a potential security risk as an user can inject external XML entities in Apache Karaf version prior to 4.1.7 or 4.2.2. It has been fixed in Apache Karaf 4.1.7 and 4.2.2 releases.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11788", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbKarafVersions  before (<) 4.1.7cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbKarafVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.2.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbKaraf\u00bbVersion:4.2.0UpdateMilestone1cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:4.2.0:milestone1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbKaraf\u00bbVersion:4.2.0UpdateMilestone2cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:4.2.0:milestone2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.21%  +0.11 \n 2  2023-03-07  9.03%  0.10%  -8.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2018-11788.txt", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106479", "ref_desc": "Apache Karaf CVE-2018-11788 XML External Entity Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
