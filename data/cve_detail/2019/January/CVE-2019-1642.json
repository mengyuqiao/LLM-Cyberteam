{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1642", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1642", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.2.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.3.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.45%  0.97%  +0.52 \n 2  2024-06-15  0.68%  0.45%  -0.22 \n 3  2024-04-16  0.59%  0.68%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-03-11  0.48%  0.59%  +0.11 \n 5  2024-02-04  0.24%  0.48%  +0.24 \n 6  2024-01-17  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-29  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-03-20  0.25%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  2.17%  0.25%  -1.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46263/", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Management Center 6.2.2.2 / 6.2.3 - Cross-Site ScriptingExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106714", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Management Center CVE-2019-1642 Cross Site Scripting VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-frpwr-mc-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Management Center Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
