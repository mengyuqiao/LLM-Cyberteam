{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7297", "Description": "An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-823G devices with firmware through 1.02B03. A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via shell metacharacters in a crafted /HNAP1 request. This occurs when the GetNetworkTomographyResult function calls the system function with an untrusted input parameter named Address. Consequently, an attacker can execute any command remotely when they control this input.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7297", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nD-link\u00bbDir-823g FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.02b03cpe:2.3:o:d-link:dir-823g_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDir-823g\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "88.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  73.08%  88.14%  +15.07 \n 2  2024-06-23  71.58%  73.08%  +1.50 \n 3  2023-05-12  51.43%  71.58%  +20.14 \n 4  2023-04-28  64.35%  51.43%  -12.92 \n 5  2023-04-12  68.80%  64.35%  -4.45 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.06%  68.80%  +66.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/leonW7/D-Link/blob/master/Vul_1.md", "ref_desc": "D-Link/Vul_1.md at master \u00b7 leonW7/D-Link \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106815", "ref_desc": "Multiple D-Link Products CVE-2019-7297 Remote Command Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
