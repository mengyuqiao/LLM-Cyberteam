{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20681", "Description": "mate-screensaver before 1.20.2 in MATE Desktop Environment allows physically proximate attackers to view screen content and possibly control applications. By unplugging and re-plugging or power-cycling external output devices (such as additionally attached graphical outputs via HDMI, VGA, DVI, etc.) the content of a screensaver-locked session can be revealed. In some scenarios, the attacker can execute applications, such as by clicking with a mouse.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20681", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMate-desktop\u00bbMate-screensaverVersions  before (<) 1.20.2cpe:2.3:a:mate-desktop:mate-screensaver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-01-03  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.10%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/issues/170", "ref_desc": "Lock Screen not working after monitor plugged / unplugged (need to restart mate-screensaver) \u00b7 Issue #170 \u00b7 mate-desktop/mate-screensaver \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/pull/167", "ref_desc": "Fix-up 5d4416a to solve lock by-passing by XRevan86 \u00b7 Pull Request #167 \u00b7 mate-desktop/mate-screensaver \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/issues/155", "ref_desc": "mate-screensaver screen lock can be bypassed by power cycling monitor [$110] \u00b7 Issue #155 \u00b7 mate-desktop/mate-screensaver \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/issues/152", "ref_desc": "mate-screensaver does not maintain user lockout / screen lock under certain conditions \u00b7 Issue #152 \u00b7 mate-desktop/mate-screensaver \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
