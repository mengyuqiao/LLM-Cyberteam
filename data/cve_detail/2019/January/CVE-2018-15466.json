{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15466", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Graphite web interface of the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) of Cisco Policy Suite (CPS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the Graphite web interface. The attacker would need to have access to the internal VLAN where CPS is deployed. The vulnerability is due to lack of authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly connecting to the Graphite web interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to access various statistics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the Cisco Policy Suite environment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15466", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPolicy Suite For Mobile\u00bbVersion:12.0.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:policy_suite_for_mobile:12.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-20  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.15%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106517", "ref_desc": "Cisco Policy Suite CVE-2018-15466 Graphite Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-cps-graphite-access", "ref_desc": "Cisco Policy Suite Graphite Unauthenticated Read-Only Access VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
