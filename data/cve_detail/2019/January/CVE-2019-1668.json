{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1668", "Description": "A vulnerability in the chat feed feature of Cisco SocialMiner could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the web-based user interface of an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input delivered to the chat feed as part of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link to attacker-controlled content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1668", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSocialminer\u00bbVersion:11.6(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:socialminer:11.6\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSocialminer\u00bbVersion:12.0(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:socialminer:12.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSocialminer\u00bbVersion:11.6(2)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:socialminer:11.6\\(2\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-12-03  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-15  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-24  0.16%  0.11%  -0.05 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106720", "ref_desc": "Cisco SocialMiner CVE-2019-1668 Chat Feed Multiple Cross Site Scripting VulnerabilitiesBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-miner-chat-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco SocialMiner Chat Feed Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilitiesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
