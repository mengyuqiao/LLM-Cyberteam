{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1644", "Description": "A vulnerability in the UDP protocol implementation for Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper resource management for UDP ingress packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of UDP packets to an affected system within a short period of time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available system resources, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1644", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIot Field Network Director\u00bbVersion:4.3(0.20)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:iot_field_network_director:4.3\\(0.20\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-12-02  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-15  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106709", "ref_desc": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director CVE-2019-1644 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-iot-fnd-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director Resource Exhaustion Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
