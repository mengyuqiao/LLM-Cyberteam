{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15464", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco 900 Series Aggregation Services Router (ASR) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of certain broadcast packets ingress to the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large streams of broadcast packets to an affected device. If successful, an exploit could allow an attacker to impact services running on the device, resulting in a partial DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15464", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAsr 900 Series Software\u00bbVersion:16.6.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:asr_900_series_software:16.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-20  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.15%  0.12%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-asr900-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco ASR 900 Series Aggregation Services Router Software Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106550", "ref_desc": "Cisco ASR 900 Series Aggregation Services Router CVE-2018-15464 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
