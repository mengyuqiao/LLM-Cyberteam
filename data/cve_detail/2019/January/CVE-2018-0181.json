{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0181", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Redis implementation used by the Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify key-value pairs for short-lived events stored by the Redis server. The vulnerability is due to improper authentication when accessing the Redis server. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying key-value pairs stored within the Redis server database. An exploit could allow the attacker to reduce the efficiency of the Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent software.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0181", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbCisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:cisco_policy_suite_diameter_routing_agent:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCisco Policy Suite For Mobile\u00bbVersion:13.0.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:cisco_policy_suite_for_mobile:13.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-20  0.43%  0.30%  -0.13 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.43%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.39%  0.32%  -0.07 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.39%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106547", "ref_desc": "Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent Access Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-cps-redis", "ref_desc": "Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent Software Redis Server Unauthenticated Access VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
