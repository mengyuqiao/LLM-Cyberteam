{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6260", "Description": "The ASPEED ast2400 and ast2500 Baseband Management Controller (BMC) hardware and firmware implement Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) bridges, which allow arbitrary read and write access to the BMC's physical address space from the host (or from the network in unusual cases where the BMC console uart is attached to a serial concentrator). This CVE applies to the specific cases of iLPC2AHB bridge Pt I, iLPC2AHB bridge Pt II, PCIe VGA P2A bridge, DMA from/to arbitrary BMC memory via X-DMA, UART-based SoC Debug interface, LPC2AHB bridge, PCIe BMC P2A bridge, and Watchdog setup.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6260", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetapp\u00bbFas/aff Baseboard Management Controllercpe:2.3:a:netapp:fas\\/aff_baseboard_management_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAspeedtech\u00bbAst2400 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:aspeedtech:ast2400_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Aspeedtech\u00bbAst2400\u00bbVersion:N/A\nAspeedtech\u00bbAst2500 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:aspeedtech:ast2500_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Aspeedtech\u00bbAst2500\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-06-14  0.31%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-16  0.26%  0.31%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.26%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.flamingspork.com/blog/2019/01/23/cve-2019-6260:-gaining-control-of-bmc-from-the-host-processor/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-6260: Gaining control of BMC from the host processor | RamblingsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190314-0001/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-6260 ASPEED BMC Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.broadcom.com/support/fibre-channel-networking/security-advisories/brocade-security-advisory-2019-785", "ref_desc": "Broadcom Inc. | Connecting EverythingThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
