{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15453", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Decryption and Verification or S/MIME Public Key Harvesting features of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to corrupt system memory. A successful exploit could cause the filtering process to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of S/MIME-signed emails. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious S/MIME-signed email through a targeted device. If Decryption and Verification or Public Key Harvesting is configured, the filtering process could crash due to memory corruption and restart, resulting in a DoS condition. The software could then resume processing the same S/MIME-signed email, causing the filtering process to crash and restart again. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent DoS condition. This vulnerability may require manual intervention to recover the ESA.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15453", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance Firmware\u00bbVersion:11.0.1-401cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:11.0.1-401:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance Firmware\u00bbVersion:11.1.0-131cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:11.1.0-131:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.15%  -0.07 \n 2  2024-11-19  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.27%  0.22%  -0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.27%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-esa-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance Memory Corruption Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106511", "ref_desc": "Cisco AsyncOS for Email Security Appliance CVE-2018-15453 Remote Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
