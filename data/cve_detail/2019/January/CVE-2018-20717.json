{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20717", "Description": "In the orders section of PrestaShop before 1.7.2.5, an attack is possible after gaining access to a target store with a user role with the rights of at least a Salesman or higher privileges. The attacker can then inject arbitrary PHP objects into the process and abuse an object chain in order to gain Remote Code Execution. This occurs because protection against serialized objects looks for a 0: followed by an integer, but does not consider 0:+ followed by an integer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20717", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nPrestashop\u00bbPrestashopVersions  before (<) 1.7.2.5cpe:2.3:a:prestashop:prestashop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.35%  0.58%  +0.23 \n 2  2024-11-24  0.35%  0.35%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-07  0.31%  0.35%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-02-13  0.35%  0.31%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.35%  -1.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/prestashop-remote-code-execution/", "ref_desc": "A Salesmans Code Execution: PrestaShop 1.7.2.4Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-2-5-maintenance-release/", "ref_desc": "Release of PrestaShop 1.7.2.5 | PrestaShop Developers\u2019 blogRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
