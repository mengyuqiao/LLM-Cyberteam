{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15458", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Shell Access Filter feature of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), when used in conjunction with remote authentication, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability occurs because the configuration of the Shell Access Filter, when used with a specific type of remote authentication, can cause a system file to have unbounded writes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of remote authentication requests to the appliance when the specific configuration is applied. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to increase the size of a system log file so that it consumes most of the disk space. The lack of available disk space could lead to a DoS condition in which the device functions could operate abnormally, making the device unstable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15458", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.2.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.2.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.3.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-11-19  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-fpwr-mc-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Management Center Disk Utilization Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106516", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Management Center CVE-2018-15458 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
