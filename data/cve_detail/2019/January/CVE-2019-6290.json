{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6290", "Description": "An infinite recursion issue was discovered in eval.c in Netwide Assembler (NASM) through 2.14.02. There is a stack exhaustion problem resulting from infinite recursion in the functions expr, rexp, bexpr and cexpr in certain scenarios involving lots of '{' characters. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted asm file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6290", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNasm\u00bbNetwide AssemblerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.14.02cpe:2.3:a:nasm:netwide_assembler:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.18%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-11-24  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-03-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-09  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.10%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.nasm.us/show_bug.cgi?id=3392548", "ref_desc": "3392548 \u2013 Stack exhaustion problem resulting from infinite recursion in the functions expr6, expr5, expr4, expr3, expr2, expr1, expr0 in eval.cIssue Tracking;Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
