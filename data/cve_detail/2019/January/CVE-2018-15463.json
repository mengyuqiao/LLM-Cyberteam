{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15463", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters passed to the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15463", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine Software\u00bbVersion:2.4(0.357)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine_software:2.4\\(0.357\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.07%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-11-24  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106513", "ref_desc": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Cross Site Scripting and HTML-injection VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/egu18W2cUp8WiuLVrxSR34dAlck.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-ise-multi-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Multiple Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TaF-YMGHwDWa1ZCescOKAoQUaEI.html"}]}
