{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6247", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) 2.4 as used in SVG++ (aka svgpp) 1.2.3. A heap-based buffer overflow bug in svgpp_agg_render may lead to code execution. In the render_scanlines_aa_solid function, the blend_hline function is called repeatedly multiple times. blend_hline is equivalent to a loop containing write operations. Each call writes a piece of heap data, and multiple calls overwrite the data in the heap.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6247", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nAntigrain\u00bbAGG\u00bbVersion:2.4cpe:2.3:a:antigrain:agg:2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSvgpp\u00bbSvgpp\u00bbVersion:1.2.3cpe:2.3:a:svgpp:svgpp:1.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.38%  0.54%  +0.16 \n 2  2024-11-22  0.38%  0.38%  0.00 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.33%  0.38%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.38%  0.33%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-04-02  0.41%  0.38%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.41%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/svgpp/svgpp/issues/70", "ref_desc": "4 bugs found in svgpp \u00b7 Issue #70 \u00b7 svgpp/svgpp \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7WDbLXXWszEhg-3mUNH5XfaIEDU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00001.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3376-1] svgpp security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AiAUXTULzEUNlrz3givkUr5Ymb4.html"}]}
