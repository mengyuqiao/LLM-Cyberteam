{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1652", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges on an affected device to execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP POST requests to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux shell as root. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1652", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv320 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.4.2.15cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv320_firmware:1.4.2.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv320\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv325 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.4.2.15cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv325_firmware:1.4.2.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv325\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "97.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.40%  97.33%  -0.07 \n 2  2024-12-03  97.37%  97.40%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-11-08  97.44%  97.37%  -0.07 \n 4  2024-05-03  97.47%  97.44%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-01-18  97.47%  97.47%  0.00 \n 6  2024-01-03  97.47%  97.47%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-12-16  97.46%  97.47%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-09-21  97.47%  97.46%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-09-09  97.45%  97.47%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-07-07  97.45%  97.45%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-05-20  97.45%  97.45%  0.00 \n 12  2023-03-21  97.45%  97.45%  0.00 \n 13  2023-03-07  44.41%  97.45%  +53.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Mar/55", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: [RT-SA-2019-005] Cisco RV320 Command Injection RetrievalExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152262/Cisco-RV320-Command-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV320 Command Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106728", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV320 and RV325 Routers CVE-2019-1652 Remote Command Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46243/", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router 1.4.2.15 - Command InjectionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Mar/61", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [RT-SA-2019-005] Cisco RV320 Command Injection RetrievalExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46655/", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV320 and RV325 - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SMHouHQFnUh-KeZbnS5eRjOl8CY.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152305/Cisco-RV320-RV325-Unauthenticated-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV320 / RV325 Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Zf9p9Q72CEKcI0bCbJcItgKuQok.html"}]}
