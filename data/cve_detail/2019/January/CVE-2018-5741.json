{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5741", "Description": "To provide fine-grained controls over the ability to use Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to update records in a zone, BIND 9 provides a feature called update-policy. Various rules can be configured to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were not initially documented, and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change #3112, the language that was added to the ARM at that time incorrectly described the behavior of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation could mislead operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive than they actually were. This affects BIND versions prior to BIND 9.11.5 and BIND 9.12.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5741", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nISC\u00bbBindVersions  from including (>=) 9.12.0andbefore (<) 9.12.3cpe:2.3:a:isc:bind:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nISC\u00bbBindVersions  before (<) 9.11.5cpe:2.3:a:isc:bind:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.56%  +0.24 \n 2  2024-02-10  0.34%  0.32%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-01-10  0.34%  0.34%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.81%  0.34%  -2.47 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190830-0001/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-5741 ISC BIND Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-13", "ref_desc": "BIND: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201903-13) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/30vq0uHM26XN890N1WWojb-pj3U.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00044.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1701-1: moderate: Security update fCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6fqV5bY6FvlwjAUgbKkoaBJI3VY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2057", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:2057 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105379", "ref_desc": "ISC BIND CVE-2018-5741 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00041.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:1699-1: moderate: Security update fCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FEiFDg2XQNwSze-PFCL_UE8x40A.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041674", "ref_desc": "BIND 'krb5-subdomain' and 'ms-subdomain' Documentation May Let Remote Authenticated Administrative Users Modify Certain Data on the Target System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2018-5741", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-5741: Update policies krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain - Security AdvisoriesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbux03927en_us", "ref_desc": "HPESBUX03927 rev.1 - HP-UX BIND, Remote Denial of Service (DoS) and Remote Unauthorized Data ModificationCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q0xZZgj5JAkQuuWhC9jEsQoIu50.html"}]}
