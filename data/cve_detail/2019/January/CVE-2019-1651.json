{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1651", "Description": "A vulnerability in the vContainer of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition and execute arbitrary code as the root user. The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking by the vContainer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious file to an affected vContainer instance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected vContainer, which could result in a DoS condition that the attacker could use to execute arbitrary code as the root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1651", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbVsmart Controller\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:vsmart_controller:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.26%  0.51%  -0.75 \n 2  2024-12-03  1.12%  1.26%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-08-18  0.80%  1.12%  +0.33 \n 4  2024-07-06  0.65%  0.80%  +0.14 \n 5  2024-03-29  0.67%  0.65%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-02-21  0.86%  0.67%  -0.19 \n 7  2024-01-18  1.15%  0.86%  -0.29 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.89%  1.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106703", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN CVE-2019-1651 Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-sdwan-bo", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN Solution Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
