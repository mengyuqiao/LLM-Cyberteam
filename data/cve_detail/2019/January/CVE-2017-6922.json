{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6922", "Description": "In Drupal core 8.x prior to 8.3.4 and Drupal core 7.x prior to 7.56; Private files that have been uploaded by an anonymous user but not permanently attached to content on the site should only be visible to the anonymous user that uploaded them, rather than all anonymous users. Drupal core did not previously provide this protection, allowing an access bypass vulnerability to occur. This issue is mitigated by the fact that in order to be affected, the site must allow anonymous users to upload files into a private file system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6922", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 7.0andbefore (<) 7.56cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.3.4cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.19%  -0.15 \n 2  2024-08-17  0.37%  0.33%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-07-24  0.52%  0.37%  -0.15 \n 4  2024-06-14  0.73%  0.52%  -0.21 \n 5  2024-01-16  0.81%  0.73%  -0.08 \n 6  2023-07-05  0.96%  0.81%  -0.15 \n 7  2023-06-20  1.01%  0.96%  -0.05 \n 8  2023-05-08  1.30%  1.01%  -0.30 \n 9  2023-05-03  0.92%  1.30%  +0.38 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.92%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038781", "ref_desc": "Drupal Bugs Let Remote Users Access Certain Uploaded Files and Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1jrQQLOU-xMRXZlr6RuSHQnXsjo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3897", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3897-1 drupal7Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.drupal.org/forum/newsletters/security-advisories-for-drupal-core/2017-06-21/drupal-core-multiple", "ref_desc": "Drupal Core - Multiple Vulnerabilities - SA-CORE-2017-003 | Drupal.orgPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LSqsC7LkCS-z7EBAv5oW0W0Xbek.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99219", "ref_desc": "Drupal Core CVE-2017-6922 Access Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
