{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5892", "Description": "bgpd in FRRouting FRR (aka Free Range Routing) 2.x and 3.x before 3.0.4, 4.x before 4.0.1, 5.x before 5.0.2, and 6.x before 6.0.2 (not affecting Cumulus Linux or VyOS), when ENABLE_BGP_VNC is used for Virtual Network Control, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (peering session flap) via attribute 255 in a BGP UPDATE packet. This occurred during Disco in January 2019 because FRR does not implement RFC 7606, and therefore the packets with 255 were considered invalid VNC data and the BGP session was closed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5892", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFrrouting\u00bbFrroutingVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.0.2cpe:2.3:a:frrouting:frrouting:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrrouting\u00bbFrroutingVersions  from including (>=) 2.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.0.2cpe:2.3:a:frrouting:frrouting:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrrouting\u00bbFrroutingVersions  from including (>=) 3.0andbefore (<) 3.0.4cpe:2.3:a:frrouting:frrouting:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrrouting\u00bbFrroutingVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.0.2cpe:2.3:a:frrouting:frrouting:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrrouting\u00bbFrrouting\u00bbVersion:4.0cpe:2.3:a:frrouting:frrouting:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.95%  0.50%  -0.46 \n 2  2024-06-02  0.81%  0.95%  +0.14 \n 3  2024-01-04  0.55%  0.81%  +0.26 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.23%  0.55%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/commit/943d595a018e69b550db08cccba1d0778a86705a", "ref_desc": "bgpd: don't use BGP_ATTR_VNC(255) unless ENABLE_BGP_VNC_ATTR is defined \u00b7 FRRouting/frr@943d595 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases/tag/frr-5.0.2", "ref_desc": "Release FRR 5.0.2 Release \u00b7 FRRouting/frr \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases/tag/frr-6.0.2", "ref_desc": "Release FRR 6.0.2 Release \u00b7 FRRouting/frr \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.frrouting.org/pipermail/frog/2019-January/000404.html", "ref_desc": "[FROG] New Releases of FRRPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases/tag/frr-4.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release FRR 4.0.1 \u00b7 FRRouting/frr \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases/tag/frr-3.0.4", "ref_desc": "Release FRR 3.0.4 Release \u00b7 FRRouting/frr \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://frrouting.org/community/security/cve-2019-5892.html", "ref_desc": "FRRoutingVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
