{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7148", "Description": "An attempted excessive memory allocation was discovered in the function read_long_names in elf_begin.c in libelf in elfutils 0.174. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via crafted elf input, which leads to an out-of-memory exception. NOTE: The maintainers believe this is not a real issue, but instead a \"warning caused by ASAN because the allocation is big. By setting ASAN_OPTIONS=allocator_may_return_null=1 and running the reproducer, nothing happens.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7148", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nElfutils Project\u00bbElfutils\u00bbVersion:0.174cpe:2.3:a:elfutils_project:elfutils:0.174:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.10%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-12-08  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24085", "ref_desc": "24085 \u2013 An Out of Memory problem was discovered in function in read_long_names in elf_begin.c in libelfExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
