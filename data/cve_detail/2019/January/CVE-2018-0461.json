{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0461", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an arbitrary script injection attack on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the software running on an affected device insufficiently validates user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link provided to the user or through the interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the user interface or access sensitive system-based information, which under normal circumstances should be prohibited.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0461", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIp Phone 8800 Series Firmware\u00bbVersion:12.5(1)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ip_phone_8800_series_firmware:12.5\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8811\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8841\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8845\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8851\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8861\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8865\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-01  0.21%  0.19%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-06-08  0.23%  0.21%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.23%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-phone-script-injection", "ref_desc": "Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series Arbitrary Script Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106515", "ref_desc": "Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series CVE-2018-0461 Arbitrary Script Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
