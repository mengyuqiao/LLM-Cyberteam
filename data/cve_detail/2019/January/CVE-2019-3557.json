{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3557", "Description": "The implementations of streams for bz2 and php://output improperly implemented their readImpl functions, returning -1 consistently. This behavior caused some stream functions, such as stream_get_line, to trigger an out-of-bounds read when operating on such malformed streams. The implementations were updated to return valid values consistently. This affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.30 and 3.27.4 and below).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3557", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHhvmVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.27.4cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hhvm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFacebook\u00bbHhvmVersions  from including (>=) 3.28.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.30.0cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hhvm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.32%  +0.08 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hhvm.com/blog/2019/01/14/hhvm-3.30.2.html", "ref_desc": "HHVM 3.30.2 and 3.27.6 | HHVMVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0XNbqh0Cr32d4h8I1rxulhnSmuc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/6e4dd9ec3f14b48170fc45dc9d13a3261765f994", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-3557: Fix OOB read in readRecord on BZ2Files/OutputFiles \u00b7 facebook/hhvm@6e4dd9e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
