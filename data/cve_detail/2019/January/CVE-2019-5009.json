{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5009", "Description": "Vtiger CRM 7.1.0 before Hotfix2 allows uploading files with the extension \"php3\" in the logo upload field, if the uploaded file is in PNG format and has a size of 150x40. One can put PHP code into the image; PHP code can be executed using \"<? ?>\" tags, as demonstrated by a CompanyDetailsSave action. This bypasses the bad-file-extensions protection mechanism.
