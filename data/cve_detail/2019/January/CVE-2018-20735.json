{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20735", "Description": "An issue was discovered in BMC PATROL Agent through 11.3.01. It was found that the PatrolCli application can allow for lateral movement and escalation of privilege inside a Windows Active Directory environment. It was found that by default the PatrolCli / PATROL Agent application only verifies if the password provided for the given username is correct; it does not verify the permissions of the user on the network. This means if you have PATROL Agent installed on a high value target (domain controller), you can use a low privileged domain user to authenticate with PatrolCli and then connect to the domain controller and run commands as SYSTEM. This means any user on a domain can escalate to domain admin through PATROL Agent. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because they believe it is adequate to prevent this escalation by means of a custom, non-default configuration", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20735", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBMC\u00bbPatrol AgentVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.3.01cpe:2.3:a:bmc:patrol_agent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "8.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  6.63%  8.17%  +1.54 \n 2  2024-08-12  7.28%  6.63%  -0.66 \n 3  2024-07-19  7.95%  7.28%  -0.67 \n 4  2024-05-18  9.44%  7.95%  -1.49 \n 5  2024-01-29  9.17%  9.44%  +0.27 \n 6  2024-01-11  8.54%  9.17%  +0.63 \n 7  2023-12-09  8.70%  8.54%  -0.16 \n 8  2023-03-07  13.82%  8.70%  -5.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.securifera.com/blog/2018/12/17/bmc-patrol-agent-domain-user-to-domain-admin/", "ref_desc": "BMC Patrol Agent \u2013 Domain User to Domain Admin \u2013 SecuriferaExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46556/", "ref_desc": "BMC Patrol Agent - Privilege Escalation Code Execution Execution (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
