{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-17188", "Description": "Prior to CouchDB version 2.3.0, CouchDB allowed for runtime-configuration of key components of the database. In some cases, this lead to vulnerabilities where CouchDB admin users could access the underlying operating system as the CouchDB user. Together with other vulnerabilities, it allowed full system entry for unauthenticated users. Rather than waiting for new vulnerabilities to be discovered, and fixing them as they come up, the CouchDB development team decided to make changes to avoid this entire class of vulnerabilities.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17188", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCouchdbVersions  before (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:couchdb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-27  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-12-12  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.12%  -1.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbmu03935en_us", "ref_desc": "HPESBMU03935 rev.1 - HPE Unified OSS Console Software Products using Apache CouchDB, Remote Code Execution, Remote Escalation of PrivilegeCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_zlXBlONpZH0A5CMF7I0FyGprGw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.couchdb.org/2018/12/17/cve-2018-17188/", "ref_desc": "Apache CouchDB CVE-2018-17188: Remote Privilege Escalations \u2013 CouchDB BlogMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S5FPHVVU5KMRFKQTJPAM3TBGC7LKCWQS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: couchdb-3.0.0-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/E6MWCJGaVfQ75X-A04sfhxQHbHs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X3JOUCX7LHDV4YWZDQNXT5NTKKRANZQW/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: couchdb-3.0.0-1.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rh686TnaGkMq8sVe4MC2EwgRjuM.html"}]}
