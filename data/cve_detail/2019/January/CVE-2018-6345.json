{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-6345", "Description": "The function number_format is vulnerable to a heap overflow issue when its second argument ($dec_points) is excessively large. The internal implementation of the function will cause a string to be created with an invalid length, which can then interact poorly with other functions. This affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.30.1 and 3.27.5 and below).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6345", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHhvmVersions  from including (>=) 3.28.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.30.1cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hhvm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFacebook\u00bbHhvmVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.27.5cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hhvm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.32%  +0.08 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hhvm.com/blog/2019/01/14/hhvm-3.30.2.html", "ref_desc": "HHVM 3.30.2 and 3.27.6 | HHVMRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0XNbqh0Cr32d4h8I1rxulhnSmuc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/190ffdf6c8b1ec443be202c7d69e63a7e3da25e3", "ref_desc": "Fix a bug in number_format() \u00b7 facebook/hhvm@190ffdf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
