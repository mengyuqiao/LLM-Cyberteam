{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1636", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Teams client, formerly Cisco Spark, could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system. This vulnerability is due to unsafe search paths used by the application URI that is defined in Windows operating systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could cause the application to load libraries from the directory targeted by the URI link. The attacker could use this behavior to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the targeted user if the attacker can place a crafted library in a directory that is accessible to the vulnerable system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1636", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Teams\u00bbVersion:3.0.4533cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_teams:3.0.4533:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "14.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  14.18%  +13.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-webex-teams", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Teams URI Handler Insecure Library Loading VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106718", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Teams CVE-2019-1636 Local Untrusted Search Path vulnerabilityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
