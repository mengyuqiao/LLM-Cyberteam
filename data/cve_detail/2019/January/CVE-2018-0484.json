{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0484", "Description": "A vulnerability in the access control logic of the Secure Shell (SSH) server of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software may allow connections sourced from a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance despite the absence of the vrf-also keyword in the access-class configuration. The vulnerability is due to a missing check in the SSH server. An attacker could use this vulnerability to open an SSH connection to an affected Cisco IOS or IOS XE device with a source address belonging to a VRF instance. Once connected, the attacker would still need to provide valid credentials to access the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0484", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIOS\u00bbVersion:16.6.4cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:16.6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIOS\u00bbVersion:16.6.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:16.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-ios-ssh-vrf", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Secure Shell Connection on VRF VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106560", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software CVE-2018-0484 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
