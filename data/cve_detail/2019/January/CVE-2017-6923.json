{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6923", "Description": "In Drupal 8.x prior to 8.3.7 When creating a view, you can optionally use Ajax to update the displayed data via filter parameters. The views subsystem/module did not restrict access to the Ajax endpoint to only views configured to use Ajax. This is mitigated if you have access restrictions on the view. It is best practice to always include some form of access restrictions on all views, even if you are using another module to display them.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6923", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.3.7cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-11-06  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-01-16  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.27%  0.17%  -0.10 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.27%  -0.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.drupal.org/forum/newsletters/security-advisories-for-drupal-core/2017-08-16/drupal-core-multiple", "ref_desc": "Drupal Core - Multiple Vulnerabilities - SA-CORE-2017-004 | Drupal.orgRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory;PatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/P-4s7vVpvXKAulqVUBe_FEENX2c.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100368", "ref_desc": "Drupal Core DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2017-004 Multiple Access Bypass VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RJId9xlnkIDf1AMHWwMmT9Buh5o.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039200", "ref_desc": "Drupal Access Control Flaws Let Remote Authenticated Users Bypass Security Restrictions on the Target System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UUoS98fmn-fNurA7NjMvOq6MYNo.html"}]}
