{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15460", "Description": "A vulnerability in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU utilization to increase to 100 percent, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper filtering of email messages that contain references to whitelisted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email message that contains a large number of whitelisted URLs. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a sustained DoS condition that could force the affected device to stop scanning and forwarding email messages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15460", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  before (<) 11.0.2-044_mdcpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbAsyncosVersions  from including (>=) 11.1.0andbefore (<) 11.1.2-023_mdcpe:2.3:o:cisco:asyncos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-11-19  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-esa-url-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance URL Filtering Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106507", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance CVE-2018-15460 Remote Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
