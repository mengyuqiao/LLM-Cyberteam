{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6250", "Description": "A pointer overflow, with code execution, was discovered in ZeroMQ libzmq (aka 0MQ) 4.2.x and 4.3.x before 4.3.1. A v2_decoder.cpp zmq::v2_decoder_t::size_ready integer overflow allows an authenticated attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of bytes beyond the bounds of a buffer, which can be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the target system. The memory layout allows the attacker to inject OS commands into a data structure located immediately after the problematic buffer (i.e., it is not necessary to use a typical buffer-overflow exploitation technique that changes the flow of control).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6250", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZeromq\u00bbLibzmqVersions  from including (>=) 4.3.0andbefore (<) 4.3.1cpe:2.3:a:zeromq:libzmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZeromq\u00bbLibzmqVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.2.5cpe:2.3:a:zeromq:libzmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "28.72% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-23  28.95%  28.72%  -0.23 \n 2  2024-12-17  53.15%  28.95%  -24.20 \n 3  2024-11-22  53.21%  53.15%  -0.06 \n 4  2024-07-15  60.56%  53.21%  -7.35 \n 5  2024-06-05  63.84%  60.56%  -3.28 \n 6  2023-12-23  70.18%  63.84%  -6.34 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.20%  70.18%  +67.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release libzmq 4.3.1 \u00b7 zeromq/libzmq \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-22", "ref_desc": "ZeroMQ: Code execution (GLSA 201903-22) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3351", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution vulnerability \u00b7 Issue #3351 \u00b7 zeromq/libzmq \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4368", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4368-1 zeromq3Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
