{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19391", "Description": "In LuaJIT through 2.0.5, as used in Moonjit before 2.1.2 and other products, debug.getinfo has a type confusion issue that leads to arbitrary memory write or read operations, because certain cases involving valid stack levels and > options are mishandled. NOTE: The LuaJIT project owner states that the debug libary is unsafe by definition and that this is not a vulnerability. When LuaJIT was originally developed, the expectation was that the entire debug library had no security guarantees and thus it made no sense to assign CVEs. However, not all users of later LuaJIT derivatives share this perspective", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19391", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLuajit\u00bbLuajitVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.5cpe:2.3:a:luajit:luajit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMoonjit Project\u00bbMoonjitVersions  before (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:moonjit_project:moonjit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/843/Access-of-Resource-Using-Incompatible-Type-Type-Confusion-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/pull/526", "ref_desc": "debug.getinfo arbitrary memory read/write by Badger9 \u00b7 Pull Request #526 \u00b7 LuaJIT/LuaJIT \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
