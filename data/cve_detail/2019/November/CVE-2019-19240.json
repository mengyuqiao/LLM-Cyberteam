{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19240", "Description": "Embedthis GoAhead before 5.0.1 mishandles redirected HTTP requests with a large Host header. The GoAhead WebsRedirect uses a static host buffer that has a limited length and can overflow. This can cause a copy of the Host header to fail, leaving that buffer uninitialized, which may leak uninitialized data in a response.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19240", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nEmbedthis\u00bbGoaheadVersions  before (<) 5.0.1cpe:2.3:a:embedthis:goahead:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.36%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-11-15  0.25%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.25%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/908/Use-of-Uninitialized-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/issues/289", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/issues/290", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/releases/tag/v5.0.1", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
