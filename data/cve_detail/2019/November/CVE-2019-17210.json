{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17210", "Description": "A denial-of-service issue was discovered in the MQTT library in Arm Mbed OS 2017-11-02. The function readMQTTLenString() is called by the function MQTTDeserialize_publish() to get the length and content of the MQTT topic name. In the function readMQTTLenString(), mqttstring->lenstring.len is a part of user input, which can be manipulated. An attacker can simply change it to a larger value to invalidate the if statement so that the statements inside the if statement are skipped, letting the value of mqttstring->lenstring.data default to zero. Later, curn is accessed, which points to mqttstring->lenstring.data. On an Arm Cortex-M chip, the value at address 0x0 is actually the initialization value for the MSP register. It is highly dependent on the actual firmware. Therefore, the behavior of the program is unpredictable from this time on.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17210", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nARM\u00bbMbed-mqtt\u00bbVersion:2017-11-02cpe:2.3:a:arm:mbed-mqtt:2017-11-02:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nARM\u00bbMbed-os\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:arm:mbed-os:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/11802", "ref_desc": "lose null pointer check in isTopicMatched() inMQTT \u00b7 Issue #11802 \u00b7 ARMmbed/mbed-os \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
