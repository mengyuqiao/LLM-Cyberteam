{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18659", "Description": "The Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) protocol allows remote attackers to spoof a Presidential Alert because cryptographic authentication is not used, as demonstrated by MessageIdentifier 4370 in LTE System Information Block 12 (aka SIB12). NOTE: testing inside an RF-isolated shield box suggested that all LTE phones are affected by design (e.g., use of Android versus iOS does not matter); testing in an open RF environment is, of course, contraindicated.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18659", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nReady\u00bbWireless Emergency Alerts\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:ready:wireless_emergency_alerts:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.12%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3326082", "ref_desc": "This is Your President Speaking | Proceedings of the 17th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and ServicesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
