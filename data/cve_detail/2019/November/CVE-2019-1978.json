{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1978", "Description": "A vulnerability in the stream reassembly component of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software, Cisco FirePOWER Services Software for ASA, and Cisco Firepower Management Center Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass filtering protections. The vulnerability is due to improper reassembly of traffic streams. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted streams through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass filtering and deliver malicious requests to protected systems that would otherwise be blocked.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1978", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Services Software For Asacpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_services_software_for_asa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat Defensecpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management CenterVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.12andup to, including, (<=) 2.9.12.15cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management CenterVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.13andup to, including, (<=) 2.9.13.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management CenterVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.14.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.9.14.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:2.9.15cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:2.9.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:2.9.16cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:2.9.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.83% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.94%  1.83%  +0.89 \n 2  2024-09-26  0.99%  0.94%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.94%  0.99%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-07-07  0.99%  0.94%  -0.05 \n 5  2024-06-21  0.99%  0.99%  0.00 \n 6  2024-06-05  0.81%  0.99%  +0.18 \n 7  2024-04-12  0.70%  0.81%  +0.11 \n 8  2024-03-31  0.76%  0.70%  -0.06 \n 9  2024-02-09  0.92%  0.76%  -0.16 \n 10  2024-01-15  0.76%  0.92%  +0.16 \n 11  2023-11-12  0.92%  0.76%  -0.16 \n 12  2023-06-19  0.65%  0.92%  +0.27 \n 13  2023-04-27  0.42%  0.65%  +0.23 \n 14  2023-03-25  0.40%  0.42%  +0.01 \n 15  2023-03-07  8.38%  0.40%  -7.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190816-ftd-srb", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software Stream Reassembly Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
