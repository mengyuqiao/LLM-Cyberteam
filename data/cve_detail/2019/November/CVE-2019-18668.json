{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18668", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Currency Switcher addon before 2.11.2 for WooCommerce if a user provides a currency that was not added by the administrator. In this case, even though the currency does not exist, it will be selected, but a price amount will fall back to the default currency. This means that if an attacker provides a currency that does not exist and is worth less than this default, the attacker can eventually purchase an item for a significantly cheaper price.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18668", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWpwham\u00bbCurrency Switcher For Woocommerce\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.11.2cpe:2.3:a:wpwham:currency_switcher_for_woocommerce:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-26  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/currency-switcher-woocommerce/#developers", "ref_desc": "Currency Switcher for WooCommerce \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.orgRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.infigo.hr/en/critical-vulnerability-in-currency-switcher-for-woocommerce-n61", "ref_desc": "Critical vulnerability in Currency Switcher for WooCommerce - InfigoThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9936", "ref_desc": "Currency Switcher for Woocommerce < 2.11.2 - Security Restrictions BypassThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
