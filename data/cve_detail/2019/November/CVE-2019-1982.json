{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1982", "Description": "A vulnerability in the HTTP traffic filtering component of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software, Cisco FirePOWER Services Software for ASA, and Cisco Firepower Management Center Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass filtering protections. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of HTTP requests, including those communicated over a secure HTTPS connection, that contain maliciously crafted headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass filtering and deliver malicious requests to protected systems, allowing attackers to deliver malicious content that would otherwise be blocked.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1982", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Services Software For Asa\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_services_software_for_asa:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat Defense\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:2.9.13cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:2.9.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:2.9.14.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:2.9.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190816-ftd-http", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software HTTP Filtering Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
