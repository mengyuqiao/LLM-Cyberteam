{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15958", "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during the initial High Availability (HA) configuration and registration process of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file during the HA registration period. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system. Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited during the HA registration period. See the Details section for more information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15958", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.4.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbPrime InfrastructureVersions  from including (>=) 3.5andbefore (<) 3.5.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbPrime Infrastructure\u00bbVersion:3.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_infrastructure:3.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEvolved Programmable Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 3.0.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:evolved_programmable_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-04  0.44%  0.62%  +0.18 \n 2  2023-09-14  0.39%  0.44%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-08-12  0.40%  0.39%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.40%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-pi-epn-codex", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Evolved Programmable Network Manager Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
