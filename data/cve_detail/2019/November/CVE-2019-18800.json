{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18800", "Description": "Viber through 11.7.0.5 allows a remote attacker who can capture a victim's internet traffic to steal their Viber account, because not all Viber protocol traffic is encrypted. TCP data packet 9 on port 4244 from the victim's device contains cleartext information such as the device model and OS version, IMSI, and 20 bytes of udid in a binary format, which is located at offset 0x14 of this packet. Then, the attacker installs Viber on his device, initiates the registration process for any phone number, but doesn't enter a pin from SMS. Instead, he closes Viber. Next, the attacker rewrites his udid with the victim's udid, modifying the viber_udid file, which is located in the Viber preferences folder. (The udid is stored in a hexadecimal format.) Finally, the attacker starts Viber again and enters the pin from SMS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18800", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRakuten\u00bbViber\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.7.0.5cpe:2.3:a:rakuten:viber:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.87% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.03%  3.87%  +2.84 \n 2  2023-12-16  0.76%  1.03%  +0.27 \n 3  2023-07-24  0.56%  0.76%  +0.20 \n 4  2023-03-11  0.52%  0.56%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.52%  -0.53 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://thesamarkand.tumblr.com/post/188785277609/viber-messenger-remote-account-reset-0day", "ref_desc": "Samarkand Web Studio \u2014 Viber Messenger Remote Account Reset (0day...Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
