{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1980", "Description": "A vulnerability in the protocol detection component of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software, Cisco FirePOWER Services Software for ASA, and Cisco Firepower Management Center Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass filtering protections. The vulnerability is due to improper detection of the initial use of a protocol on a nonstandard port. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic on a nonstandard port for the protocol in use through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass filtering and deliver malicious requests to protected systems that would otherwise be blocked. Once the initial protocol flow on the nonstandard port is detected, future flows on the nonstandard port will be successfully detected and handled as configured by the applied policy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1980", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Services Software For Asacpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_services_software_for_asa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat Defensecpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management CenterVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.12andup to, including, (<=) 2.9.12.15cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management CenterVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.13andup to, including, (<=) 2.9.13.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management CenterVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.14.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.9.14.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:2.9.15cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:2.9.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:2.9.16cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:2.9.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190816-ftd-nspd", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software Nonstandard Protocol Detection Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
