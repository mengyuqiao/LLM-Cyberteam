{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18684", "Description": "Sudo through 1.8.29 allows local users to escalate to root if they have write access to file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. This occurs because of a race condition between determining a uid, and the setresuid and openat system calls. The attacker can write \"ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\" to /proc/#####/fd/3 at a time when Sudo is prompting for a password. NOTE: This has been disputed due to the way Linux /proc works. It has been argued that writing to /proc/#####/fd/3 would only be viable if you had permission to write to /etc/sudoers. Even with write permission to /proc/#####/fd/3, it would not help you write to /etc/sudoers", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18684", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSudo Project\u00bbSudoVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.8.29cpe:2.3:a:sudo_project:sudo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/oxagast/51171aa161074188a11d96cbef884bbd", "ref_desc": "Write to /etc/sudoers using file descriptor 3 on sudo's process while asking for a pass \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
