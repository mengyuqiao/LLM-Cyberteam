{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18873", "Description": "FUDForum 3.0.9 is vulnerable to Stored XSS via the User-Agent HTTP header. This may result in remote code execution. An attacker can use a user account to fully compromise the system via a GET request. When the admin visits user information under \"User Manager\" in the control panel, the payload will execute. This will allow for PHP files to be written to the web root, and for code to execute on the remote server. The problem is in admsession.php and admuser.php.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18873", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFudforum\u00bbFudforum\u00bbVersion:3.0.9cpe:2.3:a:fudforum:fudforum:3.0.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.77% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.12%  1.77%  +0.65 \n 2  2024-10-03  1.05%  1.12%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-04-16  1.00%  1.05%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  18.06%  1.00%  -17.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sourceforge.net/p/fudforum/code/6321/", "ref_desc": "FUDforum / Code / Commit [r6321]Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fuzzlove/FUDforum-XSS-RCE", "ref_desc": "GitHub - fuzzlove/FUDforum-XSS-RCE: FUDForum 3.0.9 - XSS / Remote Code Execution (CVE-2019-18873, CVE-2019-18839)Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/j2Hfbhov7ZFNICBLgVIKEHV5sKw.html"}]}
