{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18662", "Description": "An issue was discovered in YouPHPTube through 7.7. User input passed through the live_stream_code POST parameter to /plugin/LiveChat/getChat.json.php is not properly sanitized (in getFromChat in plugin/LiveChat/Objects/LiveChatObj.php) before being used to construct a SQL query. This can be exploited by malicious users to, e.g., read sensitive data from the database through in-band SQL Injection attacks. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the Live Chat plugin to be enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18662", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nYouphptube\u00bbYouphptubeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.7cpe:2.3:a:youphptube:youphptube:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.27%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-10-26  0.25%  0.30%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-09-06  0.18%  0.25%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-08-22  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/YouPHPTube/YouPHPTube/issues/2202", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection in LiveChat plugin \u00b7 Issue #2202 \u00b7 YouPHPTube/YouPHPTube \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Dec/9", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [KIS-2019-10] YouPHPTube <= 7.7 (getChat.json.php) SQL Injection Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155564/YouPHPTube-7.7-SQL-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "YouPHPTube 7.7 SQL Injection \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
