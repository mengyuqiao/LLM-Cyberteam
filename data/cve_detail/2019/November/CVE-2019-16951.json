{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16951", "Description": "A remote file include (RFI) issue was discovered in Enghouse Web Chat 6.2.284.34. One can replace the localhost attribute with one's own domain name. When the product calls this domain after the POST request is sent, it retrieves an attacker's data and displays it. Also worth mentioning is the amount of information sent in the request from this product to the attacker: it reveals information the public should not have. This includes pathnames and internal ip addresses.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16951", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nEnghouse\u00bbWeb Chat\u00bbVersion:6.1.300.31cpe:2.3:a:enghouse:web_chat:6.1.300.31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnghouse\u00bbWeb Chat\u00bbVersion:6.2.284.34cpe:2.3:a:enghouse:web_chat:6.2.284.34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mjlanders.com/2019/11/07/multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-enghouse-zeacom-web-chat/", "ref_desc": "Multiple vulnerabilities found in Enghouse/Zeacom web chat \u2013 Matt LandersExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_Cn_Yn7zBAVdSkZXHkcQOLi4f-g.html"}]}
