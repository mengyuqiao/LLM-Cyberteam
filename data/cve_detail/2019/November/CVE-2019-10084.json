{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10084", "Description": "In Apache Impala 2.7.0 to 3.2.0, an authenticated user with access to the IDs of active Impala queries or sessions can interact with those sessions or queries via a specially-constructed request and thereby potentially bypass authorization and audit mechanisms. Session and query IDs are unique and random, but have not been documented or consistently treated as sensitive secrets. Therefore they may be exposed in logs or interfaces. They were also not generated with a cryptographically secure random number generator, so are vulnerable to random number generator attacks that predict future IDs based on past IDs. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10084", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbImpalaVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.2.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:impala:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.13%  +0.08 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ee73dd8dc38ac3b3b132c79c9a02cf9524af9aa11190474c0ebd1f13@%3Cdev.impala.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2019-10084] privilege escalation by authenticated Apache Impala users - Pony MailMailing List;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/11/04/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2019-10084] privilege escalation by authenticated Apache Impala usersMailing List;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
