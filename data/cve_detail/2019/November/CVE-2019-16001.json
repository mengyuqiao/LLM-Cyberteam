{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16001", "Description": "A vulnerability in the loading mechanism of specific dynamic link libraries in Cisco Webex Teams for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the resources loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. The malicious DLL file would execute when the vulnerable application is launched. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine with the privileges of another user account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16001", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetingscpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbWebex Teamscpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_teams:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.06%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191120-webex-teams-dll", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Teams and Cisco Webex Meetings Client DLL Hijacking VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
