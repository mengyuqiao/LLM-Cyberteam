{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16948", "Description": "An SSRF issue was discovered in Enghouse Web Chat 6.1.300.31. In any POST request, one can replace the port number at WebServiceLocation=http://localhost:8085/UCWebServices/ with a range of ports to determine what is visible on the internal network (as opposed to what general web traffic would see on the product's host). The response from open ports is different than from closed ports. The product does not allow one to change the protocol: anything except http(s) will throw an error; however, it is the type of error that allows one to determine if a port is open or not.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16948", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nEnghouse\u00bbWeb Chat\u00bbVersion:6.1.300.31cpe:2.3:a:enghouse:web_chat:6.1.300.31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.66%  1.51%  +0.85 \n 2  2023-10-20  0.52%  0.66%  +0.14 \n 3  2023-03-18  0.49%  0.52%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.49%  -0.40 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mjlanders.com/2019/11/07/multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-enghouse-zeacom-web-chat/", "ref_desc": "Multiple vulnerabilities found in Enghouse/Zeacom web chat \u2013 Matt LandersExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_Cn_Yn7zBAVdSkZXHkcQOLi4f-g.html"}]}
