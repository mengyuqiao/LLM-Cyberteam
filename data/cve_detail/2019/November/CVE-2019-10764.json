{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10764", "Description": "In elliptic-php versions priot to 1.0.6, Timing attacks might be possible which can result in practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library under certain conditions. Leakage of a bit-length of the scalar during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve which might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10764", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSimplito\u00bbElliptic-phpVersions  before (<) 1.0.6cpe:2.3:a:simplito:elliptic-php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.52%  +0.29 \n 2  2023-03-23  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.20%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-SIMPLITOELLIPTICPHP-534576", "ref_desc": "Timing Attack in simplito/elliptic-php | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/", "ref_desc": "Minerva: The curse of ECDSA noncesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Wve6Mk4cu1qgTCmgPEobcWAeq6I.html"}]}
