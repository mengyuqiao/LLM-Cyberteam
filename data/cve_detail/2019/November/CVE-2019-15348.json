{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15348", "Description": "The Tecno Camon Android device with a build fingerprint of TECNO/H612/TECNO-ID5a:8.1.0/O11019/F-180828V106:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.lovelyfont.defcontainer (versionCode=7, versionName=7.0.11). This app contains an exported service named com.lovelyfont.manager.FontCoverService that allows any app co-located on the device to supply arbitrary commands via shell script to be executed as the system user that are triggered by writing an attacker-selected message to the logcat log. This app cannot be disabled by the user and the attack can be performed by a zero-permission app. Executing commands as the system user can allow a third-party app to video record the user's screen, factory reset the device, obtain the user's notifications, read the logcat logs, inject events in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and obtains the user's text messages, and more. Executing commands as the system user can allow a third-party app to factory reset the device, obtain the user's notifications, read the logcat logs, inject events in the GUI, change the default Input Method Editor (IME) (e.g., keyboard) with one contained within the attacking app that contains keylogging functionality, and obtains the user's text messages, and more.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15348", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTecno-mobile\u00bbTecno/h612/tecno-id5a:8.1.0/o11019/f-180828v106:user/release-keys Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:tecno-mobile:tecno\\/h612\\/tecno-id5a\\:8.1.0\\/o11019\\/f-180828v106\\:user\\/release-keys_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Tecno-mobile\u00bbTecno/h612/tecno-id5a:8.1.0/o11019/f-180828v106:user/release-keys\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/android-firmware-2019/", "ref_desc": "Kryptowire Provides Details on Android Firmware Vulnerabilities - November 2019 - KryptowireThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Yoo5yppwnuYKZdn3h8y2PDlPy60.html"}]}
