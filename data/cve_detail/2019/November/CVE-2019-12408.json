{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12408", "Description": "It was discovered that the C++ implementation (which underlies the R, Python and Ruby implementations) of Apache Arrow 0.14.0 to 0.14.1 had a uninitialized memory bug when building arrays with null values in some cases. This can lead to uninitialized memory being unintentionally shared if Arrow Arrays are transmitted over the wire (for instance with Flight) or persisted in the streaming IPC and file formats.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12408", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbArrowVersions  from including (>=) 0.14.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.14.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:arrow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-13  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-909 Missing Initialization of Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/909/Missing-Initialization-of-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/49f067b1c5fb7493d952580f0d2d032819ba351f7a78743c21126269@%3Cdev.arrow.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2019-12408][CVE-2019-12410] Uninitialized Memory Vulnerabilities fixed in Apache Arrow 0.15.1 - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7MGZNVijRyCAQoJ7dnsPu_nUidA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/efd8bbf57427d3c303b5316d208a335f8d0c0dbe0dc4c87cfa995073@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2019-12408][CVE-2019-12410] Uninitialized Memory Vulnerabilities fixed in Apache Arrow 0.15.1 - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VnXmMkRm-Nljj-dKl67-2FSPOSg.html"}]}
