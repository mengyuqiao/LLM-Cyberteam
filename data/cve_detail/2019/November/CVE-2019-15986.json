{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15986", "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Unity Express could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation for certain CLI commands that are executed on a vulnerable system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the system and sending crafted CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15986", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnity ExpressVersions  before (<) 10.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unity_express:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191120-unity-exp-comm-inject", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unity Express Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
