{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12331", "Description": "PHPOffice PhpSpreadsheet before 1.8.0 has an XXE issue. The XmlScanner decodes the sheet1.xml from an .xlsx to utf-8 if something else than UTF-8 is declared in the header. This was a security measurement to prevent CVE-2018-19277 but the fix is not sufficient. By double-encoding the the xml payload to utf-7 it is possible to bypass the check for the string \u201a<!ENTITY\u2018 and thus allowing for an xml external entity processing (XXE) attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12331", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nPhpoffice\u00bbPhpspreadsheetVersions  before (<) 1.8.0cpe:2.3:a:phpoffice:phpspreadsheet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.60%  +0.36 \n 2  2023-03-12  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#180---2019-07-01", "ref_desc": "PhpSpreadsheet/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://herolab.usd.de/security-advisories/usd-2019-0046/", "ref_desc": "usd-2019-0046 | usd HerolabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
