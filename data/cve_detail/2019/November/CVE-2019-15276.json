{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15276", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists due to a failure of the HTTP parsing engine to handle specially crafted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with low privileges to an affected controller and submitting the crafted URL to the web interface of the affected device. Conversely, an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web interface to click the crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the device, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15276", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 8.4andbefore (<) 8.10cpe:2.3:a:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "16.98% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.83%  16.98%  +15.14 \n 2  2024-11-04  2.58%  1.83%  -0.74 \n 3  2024-07-03  2.84%  2.58%  -0.26 \n 4  2024-06-21  2.63%  2.84%  +0.20 \n 5  2024-02-15  3.68%  2.63%  -1.05 \n 6  2024-01-20  2.63%  3.68%  +1.05 \n 7  2023-11-18  1.33%  2.63%  +1.30 \n 8  2023-07-09  0.94%  1.33%  +0.39 \n 9  2023-05-17  0.84%  0.94%  +0.10 \n 10  2023-04-14  0.59%  0.84%  +0.24 \n 11  2023-03-13  0.48%  0.59%  +0.12 \n 12  2023-03-07  8.08%  0.48%  -7.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155554/Cisco-WLC-2504-8.9-Denial-Of-Service.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco WLC 2504 8.9 Denial Of Service \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-wlc-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller HTTP Parsing Engine Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
