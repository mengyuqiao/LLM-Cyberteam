{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16765", "Description": "If an attacker can get a user to open a specially prepared directory tree as a workspace in Visual Studio Code with the CodeQL extension active, arbitrary code of the attacker's choosing may be executed on the user's behalf. This is fixed in version 1.0.1 of the extension. Users should upgrade to this version using Visual Studio Code Marketplace's upgrade mechanism. After upgrading, the codeQL.cli.executablePath setting can only be set in the per-user settings, and not in the per-workspace settings. More information about VS Code settings can be found here.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16765", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbCodeql\u00bbForVisual Studio CodeVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:codeql:*:*:*:*:*:visual_studio_code:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-07  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 2  2024-04-22  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 3  2024-04-07  0.15%  0.12%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-03-20  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-05  0.16%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 6  2024-02-20  0.12%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-02-04  0.16%  0.12%  -0.05 \n 8  2024-01-20  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-12-02  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-09-29  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 11  2023-09-14  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-08-27  0.13%  0.10%  -0.03 \n 13  2023-07-25  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 14  2023-05-17  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 15  2023-03-30  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 16  2023-03-07  4.00%  0.10%  -3.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-250 Execution with Unnecessary Privileges", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/250/Execution-with-Unnecessary-Privileges.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/pull/174", "ref_desc": "Change distribution settings to machine scope by henrymercer \u00b7 Pull Request #174 \u00b7 github/vscode-codeql \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/security/advisories/GHSA-wf4x-8mpj-r42q", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary code execution when opening a malicious workspace \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 github/vscode-codeql \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/blob/v1.0.1/CHANGELOG.md", "ref_desc": "vscode-codeql/CHANGELOG.md at v1.0.1 \u00b7 github/vscode-codeql \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
