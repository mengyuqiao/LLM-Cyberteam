They do not correctly verify the integrity of an upgrade package before processing it. As a result, official upgrade packages can be modified to inject an arbitrary Bash script that will be executed by the underlying system. It is possible to achieve this by modifying the values in the files.SUM file (which are used for integrity control) and injecting malicious code into the upgrade.sh file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19041", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXorur\u00bbLpar2rrd\u00bbVersion:6.11cpe:2.3:a:xorur:lpar2rrd:6.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Xorur\u00bbXorur\u00bbVersion:2.41\nXorur\u00bbStor2rrd\u00bbVersion:2.61cpe:2.3:a:xorur:stor2rrd:2.61:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Xorur\u00bbXorur\u00bbVersion:2.41", "EPSS Score": "1.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  1.38%  +1.19 \n 2  2023-03-22  0.22%  0.20%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gotenigatien/Xorux-critical-vulnerability/blob/master/README.md", "ref_desc": "Xorux-critical-vulnerability/README.md at master \u00b7 gotenigatien/Xorux-critical-vulnerability \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
