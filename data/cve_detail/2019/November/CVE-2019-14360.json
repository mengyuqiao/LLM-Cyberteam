{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14360", "Description": "On Hyundai Pay Kasse HK-1000 devices, a side channel for the row-based OLED display was found. The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels, allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example, a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover confidential secrets such as the PIN and BIP39 mnemonic. In other words, the side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device's USB connection to make power-consumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances, such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14360", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHyundai-pay\u00bbHk-1000\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:h:hyundai-pay:hk-1000:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.inhq.net/posts/oled-side-channel-status-summary/", "ref_desc": "OLED side channel - summary October 2019 | invd blogExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/b3pIM6_9g6HMIFP65Yo2SMvO2xU.html"}]}
