{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1675", "Description": "A vulnerability in the default configuration of the Cisco Aironet Active Sensor could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to restart the sensor. The vulnerability is due to a default local account with a static password. The account has privileges only to reboot the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by guessing the account name and password to access the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reboot the device repeatedly, creating a denial of service (DoS) condition. It is not possible to change the configuration or view sensitive data with this account. Versions prior to DNAC1.2.8 are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1675", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbDigital Network Architecture CenterVersions  before (<) 1.2.8cpe:2.3:a:cisco:digital_network_architecture_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAironet Active Sensor\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:h:cisco:aironet_active_sensor:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190206-aas-creds", "ref_desc": "Cisco Aironet Active Sensor Static Credentials VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106944", "ref_desc": "Cisco Aironet Active Sensor CVE-2019-1675 Insecure Default Password VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
