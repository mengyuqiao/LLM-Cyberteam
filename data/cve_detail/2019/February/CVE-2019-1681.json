{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1681", "Description": "A vulnerability in the TFTP service of Cisco Network Convergence System 1000 Series software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the targeted device, possibly resulting in information disclosure. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input within TFTP requests processed by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques in malicious requests sent to the TFTP service on a targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the targeted device, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information. This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR Software releases prior to Release 6.5.2 for Cisco Network Convergence System 1000 Series devices when the TFTP service is enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1681", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  before (<) 6.5.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.48%  +0.22 \n 2  2024-07-13  0.37%  0.26%  -0.11 \n 3  2023-10-07  0.50%  0.37%  -0.12 \n 4  2023-09-04  0.41%  0.50%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-08-20  0.45%  0.41%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.43%  0.45%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-06-17  0.35%  0.43%  +0.08 \n 8  2023-05-08  0.36%  0.35%  -0.01 \n 9  2023-04-02  0.26%  0.36%  +0.11 \n 10  2023-03-25  0.31%  0.26%  -0.05 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.31%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107107", "ref_desc": "Cisco Network Convergence System 1000 Series CVE-2019-1681 Directory Traversal VulnerabilityBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190220-ncs", "ref_desc": "Cisco Network Convergence System 1000 Series TFTP Directory Traversal VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
