{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7350", "Description": "Session fixation exists in ZoneMinder through 1.32.3, as an attacker can fixate his own session cookies to the next logged-in user, thereby hijacking the victim's account. This occurs because a set of multiple cookies (between 3 and 5) is being generated when a user successfully logs in, and these sets overlap for successive logins.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7350", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZoneminder\u00bbZoneminderVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.32.3cpe:2.3:a:zoneminder:zoneminder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/issues/2471", "ref_desc": "Improper Session Management - Session Fixation \u00b7 Issue #2471 \u00b7 ZoneMinder/zoneminder \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
