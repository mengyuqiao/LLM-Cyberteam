{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20251", "Description": "In WinRAR versions prior to and including 5.61, there is path traversal vulnerability when crafting the filename field of the ACE format. The UNACE module (UNACEV2.dll) creates files and folders as written in the filename field even when WinRAR validator noticed the traversal attempt and requestd to abort the extraction process. the operation is cancelled only after the folders and files were created but prior to them being written, therefore allowing the attacker to create empty files and folders everywhere in the file system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20251", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nRarlab\u00bbWinrarVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.61cpe:2.3:a:rarlab:winrar:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "64.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  71.27%  64.56%  -6.71 \n 2  2024-06-28  74.46%  71.27%  -3.20 \n 3  2024-02-17  79.20%  74.46%  -4.73 \n 4  2024-01-30  82.22%  79.20%  -3.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  82.22%  +81.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106948", "ref_desc": "WinRAR Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesVDB Entry;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2pBCAm6bS-y1cw5r0-IjsmxMzNg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.checkpoint.com/extracting-code-execution-from-winrar/", "ref_desc": "Extracting a 19 Year Old Code Execution from WinRAR - Check Point ResearchExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B8uDFSfB2CUEgjWP3mxIMNWbUiE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.win-rar.com/whatsnew.html", "ref_desc": "WinRAR download and support: Whats NewRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/h3vCrruI3TxUUbWO7IHWHiHKQrA.html"}]}
