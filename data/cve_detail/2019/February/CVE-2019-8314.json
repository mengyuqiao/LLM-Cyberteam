{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-8314", "Description": "An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-878 devices with firmware 1.12A1. This issue is a Command Injection allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, and get a root shell. A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted /HNAP1 POST request. This occurs when any HNAP API function triggers a call to the system function with untrusted input from the request body for the SetQoSSettings API function, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in the IPAddress field.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-8314", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDlink\u00bbDir-878 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.12a1cpe:2.3:o:dlink:dir-878_firmware:1.12a1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDir-878\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "3.73% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-23  1.35%  3.73%  +2.38 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.25%  1.35%  +1.10 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-06-22  0.23%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-05-24  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-04-25  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 7  2024-02-09  0.25%  0.22%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.25%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/lieanu/vuls/blob/master/dlink/DIR-878/qos.md", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
