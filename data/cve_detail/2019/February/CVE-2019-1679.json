{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1679", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco TelePresence Conductor, Cisco Expressway Series, and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to trigger an HTTP request from an affected server to an arbitrary host. This type of attack is commonly referred to as server-side request forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for the REST API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to the affected server. Versions prior to XC4.3.4 are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1679", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Video Communication ServerVersions  before (<) x12.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_video_communication_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence ConductorVersions  before (<) xc4.3.4cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_conductor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-24  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106940", "ref_desc": "Multiple Cisco Products CVE-2019-1679 Server Side Request Forgery Security Bypass VulnerabilityBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190206-rest-api-ssrf", "ref_desc": "Cisco TelePresence Conductor, Cisco Expressway Series, and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server REST API Server-Side Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
