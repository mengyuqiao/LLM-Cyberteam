{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6340", "Description": "Some field types do not properly sanitize data from non-form sources in Drupal 8.5.x before 8.5.11 and Drupal 8.6.x before 8.6.10. This can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution in some cases. A site is only affected by this if one of the following conditions is met: The site has the Drupal 8 core RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled and allows PATCH or POST requests, or the site has another web services module enabled, like JSON:API in Drupal 8, or Services or RESTful Web Services in Drupal 7. (Note: The Drupal 7 Services module itself does not require an update at this time, but you should apply other contributed updates associated with this advisory if Services is in use.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6340", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 8.6.0andbefore (<) 8.6.10cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrupal\u00bbDrupalVersions  from including (>=) 8.5.0andbefore (<) 8.5.11cpe:2.3:a:drupal:drupal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.46%  97.47%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-12-06  97.44%  97.46%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-10  97.42%  97.44%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-09-16  97.36%  97.42%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-08-23  97.39%  97.36%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-08-04  97.31%  97.39%  +0.08 \n 7  2024-07-14  97.48%  97.31%  -0.17 \n 8  2024-06-22  97.45%  97.48%  +0.03 \n 9  2024-05-15  97.42%  97.45%  +0.04 \n 10  2024-04-27  97.48%  97.42%  -0.07 \n 11  2024-04-09  97.49%  97.48%  -0.01 \n 12  2024-03-21  97.49%  97.49%  -0.01 \n 13  2024-03-04  97.51%  97.49%  -0.01 \n 14  2024-02-15  97.50%  97.51%  +0.00 \n 15  2024-01-13  97.50%  97.50%  0.00 \n 16  2023-12-12  97.48%  97.50%  +0.02 \n 17  2023-10-19  97.48%  97.48%  +0.01 \n 18  2023-10-07  97.37%  97.48%  +0.11 \n 19  2023-08-20  97.36%  97.37%  +0.01 \n 20  2023-08-04  97.44%  97.36%  -0.07 \n 21  2023-07-20  97.48%  97.44%  -0.04 \n 22  2023-07-08  97.28%  97.48%  +0.20 \n 23  2023-06-17  97.27%  97.28%  +0.01 \n 24  2023-05-19  97.23%  97.27%  +0.03 \n 25  2023-05-08  97.48%  97.23%  -0.24 \n 26  2023-04-18  97.45%  97.48%  +0.02 \n 27  2023-03-17  97.50%  97.45%  -0.05 \n 28  2023-03-07  93.82%  97.50%  +3.68 \n 29  2023-02-07  94.60%  93.82%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2019-003", "ref_desc": "Drupal core - Highly critical - Remote Code Execution - SA-CORE-2019-003 | Drupal.orgMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46510/", "ref_desc": "Drupal < 8.5.11 / < 8.6.10 - RESTful Web Services unserialize() Remote Command Execution (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107106", "ref_desc": "Drupal Core CVE-2019-6340 Arbitrary PHP Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46459/", "ref_desc": "Drupal < 8.6.9 - REST Module Remote Code ExecutionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.synology.com/security/advisory/Synology_SA_19_09", "ref_desc": "Synology Inc.Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46452/", "ref_desc": "Drupal < 8.6.10 / < 8.5.11 - REST Module Remote Code ExecutionPatch;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
