{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7298", "Description": "An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-823G devices with firmware through 1.02B03. A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted /HNAP1 request. This occurs when any HNAP API function triggers a call to the system function with untrusted input from the request body, such as a body of ' /bin/telnetd' for the GetDeviceSettingsset API function. Consequently, an attacker can execute any command remotely when they control this input.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7298", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDlink\u00bbDir-823g FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.02b03cpe:2.3:o:dlink:dir-823g_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDir-823g\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "54.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  71.59%  54.42%  -17.18 \n 2  2024-08-03  73.58%  71.59%  -1.98 \n 3  2024-07-15  70.50%  73.58%  +3.07 \n 4  2024-06-24  73.57%  70.50%  -3.07 \n 5  2024-05-12  70.82%  73.57%  +2.75 \n 6  2024-04-07  73.57%  70.82%  -2.75 \n 7  2024-03-20  76.96%  73.57%  -3.38 \n 8  2024-03-01  74.48%  76.96%  +2.48 \n 9  2023-11-22  70.85%  74.48%  +3.62 \n 10  2023-08-15  74.48%  70.85%  -3.62 \n 11  2023-03-07  2.06%  74.48%  +72.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106814", "ref_desc": "Multiple D-Link Products CVE-2019-7298 Remote Command Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/leonW7/D-Link/blob/master/Vul_2.md", "ref_desc": "D-Link/Vul_2.md at master \u00b7 leonW7/D-Link \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
