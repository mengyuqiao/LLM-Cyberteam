{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1700", "Description": "A vulnerability in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) ingress buffer management for the Cisco Firepower 9000 Series with the Cisco Firepower 2-port 100G double-width network module (PID: FPR9K-DNM-2X100G) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. Manual intervention may be required before a device will resume normal operations. The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the FPGA related to the processing of different types of input packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by being on the adjacent subnet and sending a crafted sequence of input packets to a specific interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a queue wedge condition on the interface. When a wedge occurs, the affected device will stop processing any additional packets that are received on the wedged interface. Version 2.2 is affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1700", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower 9000 Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.2(200.8)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:firepower_9000_firmware:2.2\\(200.8\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 9000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-13  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107105", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower 9000 Series CVE-2019-1700 Remote Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190220-firpwr-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower 9000 Series Firepower 2-Port 100G Double-Width Network Module Queue Wedge Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
