{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1661", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1661", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Management Suite\u00bbVersion:15.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_management_suite:15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.07%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190206-tms-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106920", "ref_desc": "Cisco TelePresence Management Suite CVE-2019-1661 Cross Site Scripting VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
