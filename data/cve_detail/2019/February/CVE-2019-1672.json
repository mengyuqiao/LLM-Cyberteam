{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1672", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Decryption Policy Default Action functionality of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured drop policy and allow traffic onto the network that should have been denied. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of SSL-encrypted traffic when Decrypt for End-User Notification is disabled in the configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a SSL connection through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured drop policy to block specific SSL connections. Releases 10.1.x and 10.5.x are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1672", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:10.1.0-204cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:10.1.0-204:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:11.5.1-fcs-115cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:11.5.1-fcs-115:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:10.5.2-072cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:10.5.2-072:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-06-29  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.09%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190206-wsa-bypass", "ref_desc": "Cisco Web Security Appliance Decryption Policy Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106904", "ref_desc": "Cisco Web Security Appliance CVE-2019-1672 Remote Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
