{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1663", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user. RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected. RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected. RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1663", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv110w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.2.2.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv110w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv110w\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv215w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.3.1.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv215w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv215w\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv130w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.3.45cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv130w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv130w\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "97.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  96.99%  97.13%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-10-17  96.93%  96.99%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-09-23  96.89%  96.93%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-08-10  97.03%  96.89%  -0.14 \n 5  2024-07-20  97.25%  97.03%  -0.21 \n 6  2024-06-28  97.22%  97.25%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-06-07  97.24%  97.22%  -0.02 \n 8  2024-05-03  97.28%  97.24%  -0.04 \n 9  2024-04-15  97.33%  97.28%  -0.05 \n 10  2024-03-10  97.34%  97.33%  -0.01 \n 11  2024-02-21  97.36%  97.34%  -0.03 \n 12  2024-01-20  97.37%  97.36%  -0.01 \n 13  2023-12-19  97.38%  97.37%  -0.01 \n 14  2023-11-29  97.33%  97.38%  +0.05 \n 15  2023-11-15  97.28%  97.33%  +0.05 \n 16  2023-10-26  97.18%  97.28%  +0.10 \n 17  2023-10-15  97.03%  97.18%  +0.15 \n 18  2023-09-24  97.14%  97.03%  -0.11 \n 19  2023-08-27  97.30%  97.14%  -0.16 \n 20  2023-08-11  97.39%  97.30%  -0.09 \n 21  2023-07-27  97.39%  97.39%  +0.00 \n 22  2023-06-24  97.39%  97.39%  -0.01 \n 23  2023-06-09  97.39%  97.39%  +0.01 \n 24  2023-04-25  97.40%  97.39%  -0.01 \n 25  2023-04-09  97.42%  97.40%  -0.02 \n 26  2023-03-07  85.74%  97.42%  +11.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154310/Cisco-RV110W-RV130-W-RV215W-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV110W / RV130(W) / RV215W Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152507/Cisco-RV130W-Routers-Management-Interface-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV130W Routers Management Interface Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107185", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV110W/RV130W/RV215W Routers CVE-2019-1663 Remote Command Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/http/cisco_rv130_rmi_rce", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV130W Routers Management Interface Remote Command Execution | Rapid7Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46705/", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV130W Routers - Management Interface Remote Command Execution (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153163/Cisco-RV130W-1.0.3.44-Remote-Stack-Overflow.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV130W 1.0.3.44 Remote Stack Overflow \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190227-rmi-cmd-ex", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Management Interface Remote Command Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
