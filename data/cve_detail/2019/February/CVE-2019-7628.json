{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7628", "Description": "Pagure 5.2 leaks API keys by e-mailing them to users. Few e-mail servers validate TLS certificates, so it is easy for man-in-the-middle attackers to read these e-mails and gain access to Pagure on behalf of other users. This issue is found in the API token expiration reminder cron job in files/api_key_expire_mail.py; disabling that job is also a viable solution. (E-mailing a substring of the API key was an attempted, but rejected, solution.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7628", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbPagure\u00bbVersion:5.2cpe:2.3:a:redhat:pagure:5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-01  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.13%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pagure.io/pagure/pull-request/4254", "ref_desc": "PR#4254: CVE-2019-7628: Do not leak partial API keys. - pagure - Pagure.ioIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/4253", "ref_desc": "Page not found :'( - Pagure.ioBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/4230", "ref_desc": "Issue #4230: API Key reminder sends the key in the clear via email - pagure - Pagure.ioIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pagure.io/pagure/c/9905fb1e64341822366b6ab1d414d2baa230af0a", "ref_desc": "Commit - pagure - 9905fb1e64341822366b6ab1d414d2baa230af0a - Pagure.ioIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/4252", "ref_desc": "Issue #4252: CVE-2019-7628: Pagure 5.2 leaks full API keys. - pagure - Pagure.ioBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
