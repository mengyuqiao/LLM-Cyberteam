{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-8389", "Description": "A file-read vulnerability was identified in the Wi-Fi transfer feature of Musicloud 1.6. By default, the application runs a transfer service on port 8080, accessible by everyone on the same Wi-Fi network. An attacker can send the POST parameters downfiles and cur-folder (with a crafted ../ payload) to the download.script endpoint. This will create a MusicPlayerArchive.zip archive that is publicly accessible and includes the content of any requested file (such as the /etc/passwd file).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-8389", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nMusicloud Project\u00bbMusicloud\u00bbVersion:1.6ForIphone Oscpe:2.3:a:musicloud_project:musicloud:1.6:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.40%  0.08%  -1.32 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/shawarkhanethicalhacker/b98c5ac7491cf77732c793ecc468f465", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2019-8389] An exploit code for exploiting a local file read vulnerability in Musicloud v1.6 iOS Application \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
