{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6537", "Description": "Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in WECON LeviStudioU version 1.8.56 and prior may be exploited when parsing strings within project files. The process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of the current process. Mat Powell, Ziad Badawi, and Natnael Samson working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6537", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nWe-con\u00bbLevistudiouVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.8.56cpe:2.3:a:we-con:levistudiou:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "12.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-23  12.60%  12.39%  -0.21 \n 2  2024-12-17  7.73%  12.60%  +4.87 \n 3  2024-06-28  8.14%  7.73%  -0.41 \n 4  2023-10-30  8.23%  8.14%  -0.10 \n 5  2023-09-28  10.40%  8.23%  -2.16 \n 6  2023-08-26  8.10%  10.40%  +2.30 \n 7  2023-07-26  7.16%  8.10%  +0.93 \n 8  2023-07-11  8.11%  7.16%  -0.95 \n 9  2023-06-26  6.77%  8.11%  +1.34 \n 10  2023-05-24  5.65%  6.77%  +1.13 \n 11  2023-05-10  12.57%  5.65%  -6.92 \n 12  2023-04-09  10.25%  12.57%  +2.32 \n 13  2023-03-08  9.36%  10.25%  +0.88 \n 14  2023-03-07  1.01%  9.36%  +8.36 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106861", "ref_desc": "WECON LeviStudioU Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JCqT2nPfCS5knqbiGkoqtA-gcTI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-036-03", "ref_desc": "WECON LeviStudioU | CISAPatch;Third Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LJbuE69YWAUgiSzAxx_X60je3Do.html"}]}
