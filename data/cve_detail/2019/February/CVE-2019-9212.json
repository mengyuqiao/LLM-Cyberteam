{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9212", "Description": "SOFA-Hessian through 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted serialized Hessian object because blacklisting of com.caucho.naming.QName and com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.objects.XString is mishandled, related to Resin Gadget. NOTE: The vendor doesn\u2019t consider this issue a vulnerability because the blacklist is being misused. SOFA Hessian supports custom blacklist and a disclaimer was posted encouraging users to update the blacklist or to use the whitelist feature for their specific needs since the blacklist is not being actively updated", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9212", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAntfin\u00bbSofa-hessianVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.0.2cpe:2.3:a:antfin:sofa-hessian:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.63%  0.56%  -0.07 \n 2  2023-12-18  0.64%  0.63%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-04-08  0.47%  0.64%  +0.17 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.47%  -0.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/184/Incomplete-List-of-Disallowed-Inputs.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/alipay/sofa-hessian/issues/34", "ref_desc": "hessian deserialization blacklist bypass \u00b7 Issue #34 \u00b7 sofastack/sofa-hessian \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
