{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1691", "Description": "A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the unexpected restart of the SNORT detection engine, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the incomplete error handling of the SSL or TLS packet header during the connection establishment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL or TLS packet during the connection handshake. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNORT detection engine to unexpectedly restart, resulting in a partial DoS condition while the detection engine restarts. Versions prior to 6.2.3.4 are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1691", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  before (<) 6.2.3.4cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-13  0.15%  0.12%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190220-fpwr-ssltls-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SSL or TLS Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107099", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software CVE-2019-1691 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
