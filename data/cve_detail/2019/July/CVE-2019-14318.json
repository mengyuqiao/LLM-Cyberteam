{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14318", "Description": "Crypto++ 8.3.0 and earlier contains a timing side channel in ECDSA signature generation. This allows a local or remote attacker, able to measure the duration of hundreds to thousands of signing operations, to compute the private key used. The issue occurs because scalar multiplication in ecp.cpp (prime field curves, small leakage) and algebra.cpp (binary field curves, large leakage) is not constant time and leaks the bit length of the scalar among other information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14318", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCryptopp\u00bbCrypto++Versions  up to, including, (<=) 8.3.0cpe:2.3:a:cryptopp:crypto\\+\\+:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.96% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-20  2.32%  2.96%  +0.64 \n 2  2024-12-17  6.76%  2.32%  -4.44 \n 3  2024-07-23  4.99%  6.76%  +1.77 \n 4  2023-11-23  3.63%  4.99%  +1.36 \n 5  2023-07-06  3.20%  3.63%  +0.43 \n 6  2023-06-20  2.37%  3.20%  +0.83 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.32%  2.37%  +1.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-417", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/417/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/10/02/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Minerva: ECDSA key recovery from bit-length leakageCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5O_cjTwvL7xoKFpLBP-fvKYokwo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/232.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9ntwaUHxASKfeHxNUKm0AgRoob4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00066.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2019:1968-1: moderate: Security update f", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/869", "ref_desc": "Elliptic Curve timing leaks \u00b7 Issue #869 \u00b7 weidai11/cryptopp \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/7337", "ref_desc": "Return of the Hidden Number Problem. | IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded SystemsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/K3iWBgQ69wmsll2ZXnPXjIB8IOY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/", "ref_desc": "Minerva: The curse of ECDSA noncesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Wve6Mk4cu1qgTCmgPEobcWAeq6I.html"}]}
