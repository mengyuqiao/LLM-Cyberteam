{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1010299", "Description": "The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.18.0 and later is affected by: CWE-200: Information Exposure. The impact is: Contents of uninitialized memory could be printed to string or to log file. The component is: Debug trait implementation for std::collections::vec_deque::Iter. The attack vector is: The program needs to invoke debug printing for iterator over an empty VecDeque.
