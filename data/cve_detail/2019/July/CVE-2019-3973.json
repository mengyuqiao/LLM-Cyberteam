{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3973", "Description": "Comodo Antivirus versions 11.0.0.6582 and below are vulnerable to Denial of Service affecting CmdGuard.sys via its filter port \"cmdServicePort\". A low privileged process can crash CmdVirth.exe to decrease the port's connection count followed by process hollowing a CmdVirth.exe instance with malicious code to obtain a handle to \"cmdServicePort\". Once this occurs, a specially crafted message can be sent to \"cmdServicePort\" using \"FilterSendMessage\" API. This can trigger an out-of-bounds write if lpOutBuffer parameter in FilterSendMessage API is near the end of specified buffer bounds. The crash occurs when the driver performs a memset operation which uses a size beyond the size of buffer specified, causing kernel crash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3973", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nComodo\u00bbAntivirusVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.0.0.6582cpe:2.3:a:comodo:antivirus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-34", "ref_desc": "Comodo Antivirus Multiple Vulnerabilities - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/74KADU3GpueIXSeK4m4_Fn2zCWc.html"}]}
