{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11553", "Description": "In Code42 for Enterprise through 6.8.4, an administrator without web restore permission but with the ability to manage users in an organization can impersonate a user with web restore permission. When requesting the token to do a web restore, an administrator with permission to manage a user could request the token of that user. If the administrator was not authorized to perform web restores but the user was authorized to perform web restores, this would allow the administrator to impersonate the user with greater permissions. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the user would have to be an administrator with access to manage an organization with a user with greater permissions than themselves.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11553", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCode42\u00bbCode42\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.8.4cpe:2.3:a:code42:code42:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://code42.com/r/support/CVE-2019-11553", "ref_desc": "Privilege Escalation in LoginToken API - Code42 Support", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
