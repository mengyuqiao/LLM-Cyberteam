{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13605", "Description": "In CentOS-WebPanel.com (aka CWP) CentOS Web Panel 0.9.8.838 to 0.9.8.846, remote attackers can bypass authentication in the login process by leveraging the knowledge of a valid username. The attacker must defeat an encoding that is not equivalent to base64, and thus this is different from CVE-2019-13360.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13605", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nControl-webpanel\u00bbWebpanel\u00bbVersion:0.9.8.836cpe:2.3:a:control-webpanel:webpanel:0.9.8.836:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.94%  2.13%  +0.19 \n 2  2024-12-06  1.97%  1.94%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-07-09  1.64%  1.97%  +0.32 \n 4  2024-05-21  1.76%  1.64%  -0.12 \n 5  2023-04-02  1.66%  1.76%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  1.66%  +0.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153665/CentOS-Control-Web-Panel-0.9.8.836-Authentication-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "CentOS Control Web Panel 0.9.8.836 Authentication Bypass \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FRTAGDLmFQKAogO7eYc5DpMwLNk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47123", "ref_desc": "CentOS Control Web Panel 0.9.8.836 - Authentication BypassExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/i3umi3iei3ii/CentOS-Control-Web-Panel-CVE/blob/master/CVE-2019-13605.md", "ref_desc": "CentOS-Control-Web-Panel-CVE/CVE-2019-13605.md at master \u00b7 i3umi3iei3ii/CentOS-Control-Web-Panel-CVE \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
