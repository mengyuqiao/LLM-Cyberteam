{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13623", "Description": "In NSA Ghidra before 9.1, path traversal can occur in RestoreTask.java (from the package ghidra.app.plugin.core.archive) via an archive with an executable file that has an initial ../ in its filename. This allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files in scenarios where an intermediate analysis result is archived for sharing with other persons. To achieve arbitrary code execution, one approach is to overwrite some critical Ghidra modules, e.g., the decompile module.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13623", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nNSA\u00bbGhidraVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nsa:ghidra:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.59% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.67%  0.59%  -0.08 \n 2  2024-07-10  0.61%  0.67%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-06-07  0.62%  0.61%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  4.37%  0.62%  -3.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/789", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary code execution through loading a malicious project \u00b7 Issue #789 \u00b7 NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ghidra-sre.org/releaseNotes_9.1_final.html", "ref_desc": "Ghidra: Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://blog.fxiao.me/ghidra/", "ref_desc": "Do Not Trust!
