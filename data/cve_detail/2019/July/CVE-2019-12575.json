{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12575", "Description": "A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client v82 for Linux could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The root_runner.64 binary is setuid root. This binary executes /opt/pia/ruby/64/ruby, which in turn attempts to load several libraries under /tmp/ruby-deploy.old/lib. A local unprivileged user can create a malicious library under this path to execute arbitrary code as the root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12575", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nLondontrustmedia\u00bbPrivate Internet Access Vpn Client\u00bbVersion:82cpe:2.3:a:londontrustmedia:private_internet_access_vpn_client:82:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/PIA/CVE-2019-12575.txt", "ref_desc": "security-research/CVE-2019-12575.txt at master \u00b7 mirchr/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
