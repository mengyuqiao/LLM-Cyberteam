{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6637", "Description": "On BIG-IP (ASM) 14.1.0-14.1.0.5, 14.0.0-14.0.0.4, 13.0.0-13.1.1.4, and 12.1.0-12.1.4, Application logic abuse of ASM REST endpoints can lead to instability of BIG-IP system. Exploitation of this issue causes excessive memory consumption which results in the Linux kernel triggering OOM killer on arbitrary processes. The attack requires an authenticated user with role of \"Guest\" or greater privilege. Note: \"No Access\" cannot login so technically it's a role but a user with this access role cannot perform the attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6637", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nF5\u00bbBig-ip Application Security ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 14.1.0andbefore (<) 14.1.0.6cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_application_security_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip Application Security ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 14.0.0andbefore (<) 14.0.0.5cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_application_security_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip Application Security ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 12.1.0andbefore (<) 12.1.4.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_application_security_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip Application Security ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 13.0.0andbefore (<) 13.1.1.5cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_application_security_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K29149494", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109091", "ref_desc": "F5 BIG-IP ASM CVE-2019-6637 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
