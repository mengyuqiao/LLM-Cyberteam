{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12579", "Description": "A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client v82 for Linux and macOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The PIA Linux/macOS binary openvpn_launcher.64 binary is setuid root. This binary accepts several parameters to update the system configuration. These parameters are passed to operating system commands using a \"here\" document. The parameters are not sanitized, which allow for arbitrary commands to be injected using shell metacharacters. A local unprivileged user can pass special crafted parameters that will be interpolated by the operating system calls.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12579", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLondontrustmedia\u00bbPrivate Internet Access Vpn Client\u00bbVersion:82cpe:2.3:a:londontrustmedia:private_internet_access_vpn_client:82:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.23%  +0.15 \n 2  2023-08-20  0.10%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-08-04  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/PIA/CVE-2019-12579.txt", "ref_desc": "security-research/CVE-2019-12579.txt at master \u00b7 mirchr/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
