{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13146", "Description": "The field_test gem 0.3.0 for Ruby has unvalidated input. A method call that is expected to return a value from a certain set of inputs can be made to return any input, which can be dangerous depending on how applications use it. If an application treats arbitrary variants as trusted, this can lead to a variety of potential vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13146", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection;Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nField Test Project\u00bbField Test\u00bbVersion:0.3.0ForRubycpe:2.3:a:field_test_project:field_test:0.3.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-11-29  0.13%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-07-02  0.09%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109114", "ref_desc": "RubyGems field_test SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rubygems.org/gems/field_test", "ref_desc": "field_test | RubyGems.org | your community gem hostProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ankane/field_test/issues/17", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary Variants Via Query Parameters in Field Test 0.3.0 \u00b7 Issue #17 \u00b7 ankane/field_test \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
