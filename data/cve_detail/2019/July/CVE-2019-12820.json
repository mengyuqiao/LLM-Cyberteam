{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12820", "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the app 2.0 of the Shenzhen Jisiwei i3 robot vacuum cleaner. Actions performed on the app such as changing a password, and personal information it communicates with the server, use unencrypted HTTP. As an example, while logging in through the app to a Jisiwei account, the login request is being sent in cleartext. The vulnerability exists in both the Android and iOS version of the app. An attacker could exploit this by using an MiTM attack on the local network to obtain someone's login credentials, which gives them full access to the robot vacuum cleaner.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12820", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJisiwei\u00bbI3 Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.0cpe:2.3:o:jisiwei:i3_firmware:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Jisiwei\u00bbI3\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-08  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.914058.1561621210!/Olsson_Larsson-Forsberg_vacuum.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nXbPzyrXDk_ug3dTcpTnAiSe_aE.html"}]}
