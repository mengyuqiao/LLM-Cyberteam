{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13590", "Description": "An issue was discovered in libsox.a in SoX 14.4.2. In sox-fmt.h (startread function), there is an integer overflow on the result of integer addition (wraparound to 0) fed into the lsx_calloc macro that wraps malloc. When a NULL pointer is returned, it is used without a prior check that it is a valid pointer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference on lsx_readbuf in formats_i.c.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13590", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nSound Exchange Project\u00bbSound Exchange\u00bbVersion:14.4.2cpe:2.3:a:sound_exchange_project:sound_exchange:14.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sourceforge.net/p/sox/bugs/325/", "ref_desc": "SoX - Sound eXchange / Bugs / #325 Integer Overflow in sox-fmt.cExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/02/msg00009.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3315-1] sox security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kvX_AHHx_Vsh1fudN56pM3FDyf4.html"}]}
