{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12576", "Description": "A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client v82 for macOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The openvpn_launcher binary is setuid root. This program is called during the connection process and executes several operating system utilities to configure the system. The networksetup utility is called using relative paths. A local unprivileged user can execute arbitrary commands as root by creating a networksetup trojan which will be executed during the connection process. This is possible because the PATH environment variable is not reset prior to executing the OS utility.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12576", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nLondontrustmedia\u00bbPrivate Internet Access Vpn Client\u00bbVersion:82cpe:2.3:a:londontrustmedia:private_internet_access_vpn_client:82:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/PIA/CVE-2019-12576.txt", "ref_desc": "security-research/CVE-2019-12576.txt at master \u00b7 mirchr/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
