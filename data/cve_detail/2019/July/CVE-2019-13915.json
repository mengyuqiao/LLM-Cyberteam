{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13915", "Description": "b3log Wide before 1.6.0 allows three types of attacks to access arbitrary files. First, the attacker can write code in the editor, and compile and run it approximately three times to read an arbitrary file. Second, the attacker can create a symlink, and then place the symlink into a ZIP archive. An unzip operation leads to read access, and write access (depending on file permissions), to the symlink target. Third, the attacker can import a Git repository that contains a symlink, similarly leading to read and write access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13915", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nB3log\u00bbWideVersions  before (<) 1.6.0cpe:2.3:a:b3log:wide:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.41%  0.62%  +0.20 \n 2  2023-06-24  0.33%  0.41%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.33%  -0.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/b3log/wide/issues/355", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability: read and write to any file \u00b7 Issue #355 \u00b7 b3log/wide \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
