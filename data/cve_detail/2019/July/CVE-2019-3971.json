{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3971", "Description": "Comodo Antivirus versions up to 12.0.0.6810 are vulnerable to a local Denial of Service affecting CmdVirth.exe via its LPC port \"cmdvrtLPCServerPort\". A low privileged local process can connect to this port and send an LPC_DATAGRAM, which triggers an Access Violation due to hardcoded NULLs used for Source parameter in a memcpy operation that is called for this handler. This results in CmdVirth.exe and its child svchost.exe instances to terminate.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3971", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nComodo\u00bbAntivirusVersions  up to, including, (<=) 12.0.0.6810cpe:2.3:a:comodo:antivirus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-34", "ref_desc": "Comodo Antivirus Multiple Vulnerabilities - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/74KADU3GpueIXSeK4m4_Fn2zCWc.html"}]}
