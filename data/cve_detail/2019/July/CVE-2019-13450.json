{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13450", "Description": "In the Zoom Client through 4.4.4 and RingCentral 7.0.136380.0312 on macOS, remote attackers can force a user to join a video call with the video camera active. This occurs because any web site can interact with the Zoom web server on localhost port 19421 or 19424. NOTE: a machine remains vulnerable if the Zoom Client was installed in the past and then uninstalled. Blocking exploitation requires additional steps, such as the ZDisableVideo preference and/or killing the web server, deleting the ~/.zoomus directory, and creating a ~/.zoomus plain file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13450", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZoom\u00bbZoom\u00bbForMac Os XVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.4.4cpe:2.3:a:zoom:zoom:*:*:*:*:*:mac_os_x:*:*Matching versions\nRingcentral\u00bbRingcentral\u00bbVersion:7.0.136380.0312ForMac Os Xcpe:2.3:a:ringcentral:ringcentral:7.0.136380.0312:*:*:*:*:mac_os_x:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.53% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  86.96%  3.53%  -83.43 \n 2  2024-11-29  87.77%  86.96%  -0.81 \n 3  2023-11-08  88.01%  87.77%  -0.24 \n 4  2023-11-02  90.05%  88.01%  -2.05 \n 5  2023-06-15  89.33%  90.05%  +0.72 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.41%  89.33%  +87.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=951540", "ref_desc": "951540 - Security: Bypass of localhost CORS protections by utilizing GET request for an Image - chromium - MonorailExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/E_4vS3IdLIZiijmKoXSCQnmylQ4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109082", "ref_desc": "Zoom Client CVE-2019-13450 Remote Security VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/zoom_us/status/1148710712241295361", "ref_desc": "Zoom on Twitter: \"[Update] The July 9 patch to the Zoom app on Mac devices detailed earlier on our blog is now live.
