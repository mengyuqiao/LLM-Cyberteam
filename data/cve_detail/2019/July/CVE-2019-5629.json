{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5629", "Description": "Rapid7 Insight Agent, version 2.6.3 and prior, suffers from a local privilege escalation due to an uncontrolled DLL search path. Specifically, when Insight Agent 2.6.3 and prior starts, the Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at \"C:\\DLLs\\python3.dll,\" which normally is writable by locally authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local user could use Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 2.6.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5629", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRapid7\u00bbInsight AgentVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.6.3cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://help.rapid7.com/insightagent/release-notes/archive/2019/05/#20190529", "ref_desc": "Insight Agent Release Notes Archive - May 2019Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jun/13", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Rapid7\u2019s Windows InsightIDR Agent: Local Privilege EscalationMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153159/Rapid7-Windows-InsightIDR-Agent-2.6.3.14-Local-Privilege-Escalation.html", "ref_desc": "Rapid7 Windows InsightIDR Agent 2.6.3.14 Local Privilege Escalation \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bogner.sh/2019/06/local-privilege-escalation-in-rapid7s-windows-insight-idr-agent/", "ref_desc": "Local Privilege Escalation in Rapid7\u2019s Windows Insight IDR Agent \u00bb #bogner.shExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/0", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Rapid7\u2019s Windows InsightIDR Agent: Local Privilege EscalationIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
