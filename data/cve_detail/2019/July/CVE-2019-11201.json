{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11201", "Description": "Dolibarr ERP/CRM 9.0.1 provides a module named website that provides for creation of public websites with a WYSIWYG editor. It was identified that the editor also allowed inclusion of dynamic code, which can lead to code execution on the host machine. An attacker has to check a setting on the same page, which specifies the inclusion of dynamic content. Thus, a lower privileged user of the application can execute code under the context and permissions of the underlying web server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11201", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDolibarr\u00bbDolibarr Erp/crm\u00bbVersion:9.0.1cpe:2.3:a:dolibarr:dolibarr_erp\\/crm:9.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-19  0.22%  0.27%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.22%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.14%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://know.bishopfox.com/advisories/dolibarr-version-9-0-1-vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "Dolibarr Version 9.0.1 \u2014 Multiple VulnerabilitiesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Bd0hjrPvrDkSGZNWo0Spnz5MqsU.html"}]}
