It was possible for an attacker to use a vulnerability in the configuration of the XML processor to read any file on the host system. Because all credentials were stored in a cleartext file, it was possible to steal all users' credentials (including the highest privileged users).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12924", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nMailenable\u00bbMailenable\u00bb     PremiumEditionVersions  from including (>=) 8.00andbefore (<) 8.64cpe:2.3:a:mailenable:mailenable:*:*:*:*:premium:*:*:*Matching versions\nMailenable\u00bbMailenable\u00bb     PremiumEditionVersions  from including (>=) 10.00andbefore (<) 10.24cpe:2.3:a:mailenable:mailenable:*:*:*:*:premium:*:*:*Matching versions\nMailenable\u00bbMailenable\u00bb     PremiumEditionVersions  from including (>=) 9.0andbefore (<) 9.83cpe:2.3:a:mailenable:mailenable:*:*:*:*:premium:*:*:*Matching versions\nMailenable\u00bbMailenable\u00bb     PremiumEditionVersions  from including (>=) 7.0andbefore (<) 7.62cpe:2.3:a:mailenable:mailenable:*:*:*:*:premium:*:*:*Matching versions\nMailenable\u00bbMailenable\u00bb     PremiumEditionVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.90cpe:2.3:a:mailenable:mailenable:*:*:*:*:premium:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.21%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.mailenable.com/Premium-ReleaseNotes.txt", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/aqHegA5XM29GObNaBP5UG9MVQIo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/our-research/technical-advisory-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-mailenable/", "ref_desc": "Technical Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in MailEnableRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Kc74eRQI-XMno2koTVovGDVkBDw.html"}]}
