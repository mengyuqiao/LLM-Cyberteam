{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13612", "Description": "MDaemon Email Server 19 through 20.0.1 skips SpamAssassin checks by default for e-mail messages larger than 2 MB (and limits checks to 10 MB even with special configuration), which is arguably inconsistent with currently popular message sizes. This might interfere with risk management for malicious e-mail, if a customer deploys a server with sufficient resources to scan large messages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13612", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nAltn\u00bbMdaemon Email Server\u00bbVersion:19cpe:2.3:a:altn:mdaemon_email_server:19:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://lists.altn.com/WebX/.59862f3c", "ref_desc": "Alt-N Discussion Groups - SpamAssassin Message Size LimitVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
