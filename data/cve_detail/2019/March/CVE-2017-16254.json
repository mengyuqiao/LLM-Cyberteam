Specially crafted commands sent through the PubNub service can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can send an authenticated HTTP request at 0x9d014e4c the value for the flg key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at $sp+0x270. This buffer is 16 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16254", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nInsteon\u00bbHub Firmware\u00bbVersion:1012cpe:2.3:o:insteon:hub_firmware:1012:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Insteon\u00bbHUB\u00bbVersion:2245-222", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0483", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2017-0483 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3S6qLLOWDG4NqTTnrnnIxwohxZY.html"}]}
