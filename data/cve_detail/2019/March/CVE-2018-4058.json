{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-4058", "Description": "An exploitable unsafe default configuration vulnerability exists in the TURN server functionality of coTURN prior to 4.5.0.9. By default, the TURN server allows relaying external traffic to the loopback interface of its own host. This can provide access to other private services running on that host, which can lead to further attacks. An attacker can set up a relay with a loopback address as the peer on an affected TURN server to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-4058", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCoturn Project\u00bbCoturnVersions  before (<) 4.5.0.9cpe:2.3:a:coturn_project:coturn:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0732", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0732 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceMitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/aYrPrsljzhcKhZAXPDaAkOawyqI.html"}]}
