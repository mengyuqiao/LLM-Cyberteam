{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9117", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Motorola C1 and M2 devices with firmware 1.01 and 1.07 respectively. This issue is a Command Injection allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, and get a root shell. A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted /HNAP1 POST request. This occurs when any HNAP API function triggers a call to the system function with untrusted input from the request body for the SetNetworkTomographySettings API function, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in the tomography_ping_number field.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9117", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMotorola\u00bbM2 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.07cpe:2.3:o:motorola:m2_firmware:1.07:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Motorola\u00bbM2\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMotorola\u00bbC1 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.01cpe:2.3:o:motorola:c1_firmware:1.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Motorola\u00bbC1\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.73%  1.30%  +0.57 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.73%  -0.43 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/lieanu/vuls/blob/master/motorola/M2_C1/SetNetworkTomographySettings.md", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
