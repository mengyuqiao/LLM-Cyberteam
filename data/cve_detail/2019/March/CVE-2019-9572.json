{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9572", "Description": "SchoolCMS version 2.3.1 allows file upload via the theme upload feature at admin.php?m=admin&c=theme&a=upload by using the .zip extension along with the _Static substring, changing the Content-Type to application/zip, and placing PHP code after the ZIP header. This ultimately allows execution of arbitrary PHP code in Public\\Home\\1_Static.php because of mishandling in the Application\\Admin\\Controller\\ThemeController.class.php Upload() function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9572", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSchoolcms\u00bbSchoolcms\u00bbVersion:2.3.1cpe:2.3:a:schoolcms:schoolcms:2.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.22%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-09  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.34%  0.13%  -1.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PearlyNautilus/Security-Code-Review/issues/3", "ref_desc": "SchoolCMS_File_Upload_Vuln \u00b7 Issue #3 \u00b7 PearlyNautilus/Security-Code-Review \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
