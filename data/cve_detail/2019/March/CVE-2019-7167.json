{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7167", "Description": "Zcash, before the Sapling network upgrade (2018-10-28), had a counterfeiting vulnerability. A key-generation process, during evaluation of polynomials related to a to-be-proven statement, produced certain bypass elements. Availability of these elements allowed a cheating prover to bypass a consistency check, and consequently transform the proof of one statement into an ostensibly valid proof of a different statement, thereby breaking the soundness of the proof system. This misled the original Sprout zk-SNARK verifier into accepting the correctness of a transaction.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7167", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZ.cash\u00bbZcashVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:z.cash:zcash:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.21%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-03-20  0.17%  0.23%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://z.cash/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/", "ref_desc": "Zcash Counterfeiting Vulnerability Successfully Remediated - Electric Coin CompanyVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/zcash-vulnerability-cryptocurrency/", "ref_desc": "Zcash Bug Could Have Allowed 'Infinite Counterfeit' Cryptocurrency | FortunePress/Media Coverage;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension", "ref_desc": "GitHub - JinBean/CVE-Extension: This repository is an extension of our research on cryptocurrency clones and documents existing vulnerabilities discovered in those clonesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lvccCTaCG5dDT3izG8NNumOJx84.html"}]}
