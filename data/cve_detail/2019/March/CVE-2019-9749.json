{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9749", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the MQTT input plugin in Fluent Bit through 1.0.4. When this plugin acts as an MQTT broker (server), it mishandles incoming network messages. After processing a crafted packet, the plugin's mqtt_packet_drop function (in /plugins/in_mqtt/mqtt_prot.c) executes the memmove() function with a negative size parameter. That leads to a crash of the whole Fluent Bit server via a SIGSEGV signal.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9749", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTreasuredata\u00bbFluent BitVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.4cpe:2.3:a:treasuredata:fluent_bit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.12%  0.08%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-681 Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/681/Incorrect-Conversion-between-Numeric-Types.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/1135", "ref_desc": "Memory corruption in MQTT input plugin leading to crash of the server while processing crafted MQTT message \u00b7 Issue #1135 \u00b7 fluent/fluent-bit \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
