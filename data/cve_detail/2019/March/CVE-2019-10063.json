{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10063", "Description": "Flatpak before 1.0.8, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.4, and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 allows a sandbox bypass. Flatpak versions since 0.8.1 address CVE-2017-5226 by using a seccomp filter to prevent sandboxed apps from using the TIOCSTI ioctl, which could otherwise be used to inject commands into the controlling terminal so that they would be executed outside the sandbox after the sandboxed app exits. This fix was incomplete: on 64-bit platforms, the seccomp filter could be bypassed by an ioctl request number that has TIOCSTI in its 32 least significant bits and an arbitrary nonzero value in its 32 most significant bits, which the Linux kernel would treat as equivalent to TIOCSTI.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10063", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.1.3cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  before (<) 1.0.8cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andbefore (<) 1.2.4cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpak\u00bbVersion:1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:1.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-03-19  0.25%  0.21%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.25%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1143", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:1143 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1024", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:1024 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2782", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-10063: incomplete TIOCSTI filtering, similar to snapd's CVE-2019-7303 \u00b7 Issue #2782 \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
