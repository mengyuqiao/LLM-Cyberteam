{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12551", "Description": "When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured to use a password file for authentication, any malformed data in the password file will be treated as valid. This typically means that the malformed data becomes a username and no password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication and get access to the broker by using the malformed username. In particular, a blank line will be treated as a valid empty username. Other security measures are unaffected. Users who have only used the mosquitto_passwd utility to create and modify their password files are unaffected by this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12551", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbMosquittoVersions  from including (>=) 1.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.5.5cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:mosquitto:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.25%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/703/Improper-Check-or-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543401", "ref_desc": "543401 \u2013 (CVE-2018-12551) Blank username allows Mosquitto Security BypassExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00035.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1972-1] mosquitto security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EgqRGHS9S4UWS6CQcadcky7f3UA.html"}]}
