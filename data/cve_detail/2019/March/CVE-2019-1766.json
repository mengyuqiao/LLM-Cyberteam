{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1766", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not restrict the maximum size of certain files that can be written to disk. An attacker who has valid administrator credentials for an affected system could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, remote connection request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write a file that consumes most of the available disk space on the system, causing application functions to operate abnormally and leading to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software release prior to 12.5(1)SR1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1766", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIp Phone 8800 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 12.5\\(1\\)sr1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ip_phone_8800_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8800\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190320-ipfudos", "ref_desc": "Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series File Upload Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
