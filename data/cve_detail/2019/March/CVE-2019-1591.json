{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1591", "Description": "A vulnerability in a specific CLI command implementation of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape a restricted shell on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when issuing a specific CLI command with parameters on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device CLI and issuing certain commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability only affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switches that are running a release prior to 14.0(3d).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1591", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbNx-osVersions  before (<) 14.0\\(3d\\)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:nx-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbNexus 9000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107311", "ref_desc": "Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches CVE-2019-1591 Local Command Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-aci-shell-escape", "ref_desc": "Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches Application Centric Infrastructure Mode Shell Escape VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
