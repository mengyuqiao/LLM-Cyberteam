{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12550", "Description": "When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured to use an ACL file, and that ACL file is empty, or contains only comments or blank lines, then Mosquitto will treat this as though no ACL file has been defined and use a default allow policy. The new behaviour is to have an empty ACL file mean that all access is denied, which is not a useful configuration but is not unexpected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12550", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbMosquittoVersions  from including (>=) 1.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.5.5cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:mosquitto:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-440 Expected Behavior Violation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/440/Expected-Behavior-Violation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=541870", "ref_desc": "541870 \u2013 (CVE-2018-12550) mosquitto: An empty ACL file grant all permissions to clientsIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00035.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1972-1] mosquitto security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EgqRGHS9S4UWS6CQcadcky7f3UA.html"}]}
