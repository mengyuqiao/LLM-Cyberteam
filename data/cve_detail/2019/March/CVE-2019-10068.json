{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10068", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Kentico 12.0.x before 12.0.15, 11.0.x before 11.0.48, 10.0.x before 10.0.52, and 9.x versions. Due to a failure to validate security headers, it was possible for a specially crafted request to the staging service to bypass the initial authentication and proceed to deserialize user-controlled .NET object input. This deserialization then led to unauthenticated remote code execution on the server where the Kentico instance was hosted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10068", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nKentico\u00bbKenticoVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andbefore (<) 12.0.15cpe:2.3:a:kentico:kentico:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKentico\u00bbKenticoVersions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.0.48cpe:2.3:a:kentico:kentico:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKentico\u00bbKenticoVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.0.52cpe:2.3:a:kentico:kentico:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKentico\u00bbKenticoVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.0.51cpe:2.3:a:kentico:kentico:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.29%  96.93%  -0.36 \n 2  2024-09-25  97.24%  97.29%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-08-16  97.25%  97.24%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-07-25  97.31%  97.25%  -0.07 \n 5  2024-07-17  97.34%  97.31%  -0.03 \n 6  2024-03-19  97.33%  97.34%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-03-04  97.26%  97.33%  +0.06 \n 8  2024-02-07  97.32%  97.26%  -0.06 \n 9  2024-01-30  97.36%  97.32%  -0.04 \n 10  2023-12-25  97.39%  97.36%  -0.04 \n 11  2023-12-11  97.37%  97.39%  +0.03 \n 12  2023-11-09  97.40%  97.37%  -0.04 \n 13  2023-10-20  97.40%  97.40%  +0.01 \n 14  2023-09-22  97.36%  97.40%  +0.04 \n 15  2023-06-21  97.34%  97.36%  +0.02 \n 16  2023-06-06  97.38%  97.34%  -0.04 \n 17  2023-05-05  97.43%  97.38%  -0.05 \n 18  2023-04-19  97.45%  97.43%  -0.02 \n 19  2023-03-19  97.43%  97.45%  +0.02 \n 20  2023-03-07  43.39%  97.43%  +54.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157588/Kentico-CMS-12.0.14-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Kentico CMS 12.0.14 Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://devnet.kentico.com/download/hotfixes#securityBugs-v12", "ref_desc": "HotfixesRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
