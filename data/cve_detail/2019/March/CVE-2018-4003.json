{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-4003", "Description": "An exploitable heap overflow vulnerability exists in the mdnscap binary of the CUJO Smart Firewall running firmware 7003. The string lengths are handled incorrectly when parsing character strings in mDNS resource records, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the mdnscap process. An unauthenticated attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-4003", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGetcujo\u00bbSmart Firewall\u00bbVersion:7003cpe:2.3:a:getcujo:smart_firewall:7003:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.61%  +0.18 \n 2  2023-06-30  0.48%  0.42%  -0.05 \n 3  2023-06-16  0.60%  0.48%  -0.13 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.70%  0.60%  -0.10 \n 5  2023-04-30  0.59%  0.70%  +0.11 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.59%  -0.49 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0672", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2018-0672 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
