{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1595", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol implementation in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect allocation of an internal interface index. An adjacent attacker with the ability to submit a crafted FCoE packet that crosses affected interfaces could trigger this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a packet loop and high throughput on the affected interfaces, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 7.3(5)N1(1).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1595", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbNx-osVersions  before (<) 7.3\\(5\\)n1\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:nx-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbNexus 5600\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbNexus 6000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-913 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/913/Improper-Control-of-Dynamically-Managed-Code-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nexus-fbr-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Nexus 5600 and 6000 Series Switches Fibre Channel over Ethernet Denial of Service VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107320", "ref_desc": "Cisco Nexus 5600 and 6000 Series Switches CVE-2019-1595 Denial of Service VulnerabilityVDB Entry;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
