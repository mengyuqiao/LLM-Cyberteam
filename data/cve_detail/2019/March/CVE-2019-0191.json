{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-0191", "Description": "Apache Karaf kar deployer reads .kar archives and extracts the paths from the \"repository/\" and \"resources/\" entries in the zip file. It then writes out the content of these paths to the Karaf repo and resources directories. However, it doesn't do any validation on the paths in the zip file. This means that a malicious user could craft a .kar file with \"..\" directory names and break out of the directories to write arbitrary content to the filesystem. This is the \"Zip-slip\" vulnerability - https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability. This vulnerability is low if the Karaf process user has limited permission on the filesystem. Any Apache Karaf releases prior 4.2.3 is impacted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0191", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbKarafVersions  before (<) 4.2.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:karaf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-01-24  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/cef9a2d4b547625e5214684283ac5c59c9d9740e092e777dc3f85070@%3Ccommits.karaf.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[karaf-site] branch trunk updated: Publish CVE-2019-0226 - Pony Mail", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107462", "ref_desc": "Apache Karaf CVE-2019-0191 Arbitrary File Overwrite VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/6856aa7ed7dd805eaf65d0e5e95027dda3b2307aacd1ab4a838c5cd1@%3Cuser.karaf.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] New security advisory for CVE-2019-0191 released for Apache Karaf - Pony MailMailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
