{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-18365", "Description": "The Management Console in GitHub Enterprise 2.8.x before 2.8.7 has a deserialization issue that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. This occurs because the enterprise session secret is always the same, and can be found in the product's source code. By sending a crafted cookie signed with this secret, one can call Marshal.load with arbitrary data, which is a problem because the Marshal data format allows Ruby objects.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18365", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbGithub\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.8.0andbefore (<) 2.8.7cpe:2.3:a:github:github:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbGithub\u00bbVersion:2.8.7cpe:2.3:a:github:github:2.8.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.06%  2.12%  +1.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.98%  1.06%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exablue.de/blog/2017-03-15-github-enterprise-remote-code-execution.html", "ref_desc": "GitHub Enterprise Remote Code Execution | exablue GmbHExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://enterprise.github.com/releases/2.8.7/notes", "ref_desc": "GitHub Enterprise - The best way to build and ship softwareVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
