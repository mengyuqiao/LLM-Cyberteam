{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-0212", "Description": "In all previously released Apache HBase 2.x versions (2.0.0-2.0.4, 2.1.0-2.1.3), authorization was incorrectly applied to users of the HBase REST server. Requests sent to the HBase REST server were executed with the permissions of the REST server itself, not with the permissions of the end-user. This issue is only relevant when HBase is configured with Kerberos authentication, HBase authorization is enabled, and the REST server is configured with SPNEGO authentication. This issue does not extend beyond the HBase REST server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0212", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbHbaseVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.0.4cpe:2.3:a:apache:hbase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbHbaseVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:hbase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.32%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-08-18  0.26%  0.24%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-07-06  0.36%  0.26%  -0.11 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.36%  0.36%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-03-21  0.31%  0.36%  +0.05 \n 6  2024-03-06  0.31%  0.31%  +0.00 \n 7  2024-02-09  0.27%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-11-08  0.30%  0.27%  -0.03 \n 9  2023-08-24  0.31%  0.30%  -0.02 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.63%  0.31%  -1.32 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107624", "ref_desc": "Apache HBase CVE-2019-0212 Authorization Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/03/27/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2019-0212] Apache HBase REST Server incorrect user authorizationMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b0656d359c7d40ec9f39c8cc61bca66802ef9a2a12ee199f5b0c1442@%3Cdev.drill.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Pony Mail!CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ICEG6PoreNpccIxmPO_DIa8bMng.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/66535e15007cda8f9308eec10e12ffe349e0b8b55e56ec6ee02b71d2@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2019-0212] Apache HBase REST Server incorrect user authorization - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/519eb0fd45642dcecd9ff74cb3e71c20a4753f7d82e2f07864b5108f@%3Cdev.drill.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[jira] [Created] (DRILL-7416) Updates required to dependencies to resolve potential security vulnerabilities - Pony MailCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yMY_T4N5T2iajoqt5_uJ_YV0Xcw.html"}]}
