{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-0187", "Description": "Unauthenticated RCE is possible when JMeter is used in distributed mode (-r or -R command line options). Attacker can establish a RMI connection to a jmeter-server using RemoteJMeterEngine and proceed with an attack using untrusted data deserialization. This only affect tests running in Distributed mode. Note that versions before 4.0 are not able to encrypt traffic between the nodes, nor authenticate the participating nodes so upgrade to JMeter 5.1 is also advised.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0187", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbJmeter\u00bbVersion:5.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:jmeter:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbJmeter\u00bbVersion:4.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:jmeter:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.40%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-09-01  0.38%  0.26%  -0.11 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.38%  -0.51 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jmeter-user/201903.mbox/%3CCAH9fUpaUQaFbgY1Zh4OvKSL4wdvGAmVt%2Bn4fegibDoAxK5XARw%40mail.gmail.com%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] CVE-2019-0187: Apache JMeter Missing client auth for RMI connection when distributed test is usedMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107219", "ref_desc": "Apache JMeter CVE-2019-0187 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
