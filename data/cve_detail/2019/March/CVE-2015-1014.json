{"CVE Code": "CVE-2015-1014", "Description": "A successful exploit of these vulnerabilities requires the local user to load a crafted DLL file in the system directory on servers running Schneider Electric OFS v3.5 with version v7.40 of SCADA Expert Vijeo Citect/CitectSCADA, OFS v3.5 with version v7.30 of Vijeo Citect/CitectSCADA, and OFS v3.5 with version v7.20 of Vijeo Citect/CitectSCADA.. If the application attempts to open that file, the application could crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. Schneider Electric recommends vulnerable users upgrade the OFS to V3.5 and install the latest service pack (SP 6 or newer) for their associated version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-1014", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSchneider-electric\u00bbOpc Factory Server\u00bbVersion:3.5cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:opc_factory_server:3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Schneider-electric\u00bbCitectscada\u00bbVersion:7.20When used together with:Schneider-electric\u00bbCitectscada\u00bbVersion:7.30When used together with:Schneider-electric\u00bbCitectscada\u00bbVersion:7.40When used together with:Schneider-electric\u00bbScada Expert Vijeo Citect\u00bbVersion:7.20When used together with:Schneider-electric\u00bbScada Expert Vijeo Citect\u00bbVersion:7.30When used together with:Schneider-electric\u00bbScada Expert Vijeo Citect\u00bbVersion:7.40", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.17%  +0.13 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-15-141-01", "ref_desc": "Schneider Electric OFS Server Vulnerability (Update A) | CISAMitigation;US Government Resource;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
