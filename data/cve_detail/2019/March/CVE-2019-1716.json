{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1716", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability exists because the software improperly validates user-supplied input during user authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device using HTTP and supplying malicious user credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition, or to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the app user. Cisco fixed this vulnerability in the following SIP Software releases: 10.3(1)SR5 and later for Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831; 11.0(4)SR3 and later for Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 and later for the rest of the Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1716", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIp Phone 8800 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 12.5\\(1\\)sr1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ip_phone_8800_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8800\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIp Phone 8821 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 11.0\\(4\\)sr3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ip_phone_8821_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8821\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIp Phone 8821-ex FirmwareVersions  before (<) 11.0\\(4\\)sr3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ip_phone_8821-ex_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Phone 8821-ex\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIp Conference Phone 7800 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 12.5\\(1\\)sr1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ip_conference_phone_7800_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIp Conference Phone 7800\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbUnified Ip Conferenece Phone 8831 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 10.3\\(1\\)sr5cpe:2.3:o:cisco:unified_ip_conferenece_phone_8831_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbUnified Ip Conferenece Phone 8831\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.63%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190320-ip-phone-rce", "ref_desc": "Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
