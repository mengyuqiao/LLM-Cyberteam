{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-0389", "Description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) processing in Cisco Small Business SPA514G IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper processing of SIP request messages by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition that persists until the device is restarted manually. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business SPA514G IP Phones that are running firmware release 7.6.2SR2 or earlier.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0389", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSpa514g FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.6.2sr2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:spa514g_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbSpa514g\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-08-03  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107402", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business SPA514G IP Phones CVE-2018-0389 Remote Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190313-sip", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business SPA514G IP Phones SIP Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
