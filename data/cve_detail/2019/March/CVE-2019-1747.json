{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1747", "Description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Short Message Service (SMS) handling functionality of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper processing of SMS protocol data units (PDUs) that are encoded with a special character set. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SMS message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wireless WAN (WWAN) cellular interface module on an affected device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1747", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIOS\u00bbVersion:15.8(3)mcpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.8\\(3\\)m:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.10.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.10.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-08-17  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-sms-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Short Message Service Denial of Service VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107599", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software CVE-2019-1747 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
