{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18466", "Description": "An issue was discovered in SecurEnvoy SecurAccess 9.3.502. When put in Debug mode and used for RDP connections, the application stores the emergency credentials in cleartext in the logs (present in the DEBUG folder) that can be accessed by anyone. NOTE: The vendor disputes this as a vulnerability since the disclosure of a local account password (actually an alpha numeric passcode) is achievable only when a custom registry key is added to the windows registry. This action requires administrator access and the registry key is only provided by support staff at securenvoy to troubleshoot customer issues", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18466", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSecurenvoy\u00bbSecuraccess\u00bbVersion:9.3.502cpe:2.3:a:securenvoy:securaccess:9.3.502:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.excellium-services.com/cert-xlm-advisory/cve-2018-18466/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-18466 - Excellium ServicesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
