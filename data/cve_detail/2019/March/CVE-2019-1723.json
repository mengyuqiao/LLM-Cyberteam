{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1723", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access an affected device by using an account that has a default, static password. This account does not have administrator privileges. The vulnerability exists because the affected software has a user account with a default, static password. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to the affected system using this account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the CSPC using the default account. For Cisco CSPC 2.7.x, Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Release 2.7.4.6. For Cisco CSPC 2.8.x, Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Release 2.8.1.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1723", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbCommon Services Platform CollectorVersions  from including (>=) 2.8.0andbefore (<) 2.8.1.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:common_services_platform_collector:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCommon Services Platform CollectorVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.2andbefore (<) 2.7.4.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:common_services_platform_collector:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.41%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-09-12  0.36%  0.32%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-08-03  0.48%  0.36%  -0.13 \n 4  2024-04-10  0.49%  0.48%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-03-06  0.34%  0.49%  +0.15 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.34%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107405", "ref_desc": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector CVE-2019-1723 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.info-sec.ca/advisories/Cisco-Collector.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco Common Service Platform Collector - Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-1723) - Info-Sec.CAThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190313-cspcscv", "ref_desc": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Static Credential VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
