{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9750", "Description": "In IoTivity through 1.3.1, the CoAP server interface can be used for Distributed Denial of Service attacks using source IP address spoofing and UDP-based traffic amplification. The reflected traffic is 6 times bigger than spoofed requests. This occurs because the construction of a \"4.01 Unauthorized\" response is mishandled. NOTE: the vendor states \"While this is an interesting attack, there is no plan for maintainer to fix, as we are migrating to IoTivity Lite.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9750", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nIotivity\u00bbIotivityVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.1cpe:2.3:a:iotivity:iotivity:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.07%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.10%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.iotivity.org/browse/IOT-3267", "ref_desc": "[IOT-3267] Traffic amplification of UDP packets - IoTivityExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
