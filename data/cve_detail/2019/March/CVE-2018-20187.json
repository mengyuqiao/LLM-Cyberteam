{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20187", "Description": "A side-channel issue was discovered in Botan before 2.9.0. An attacker capable of precisely measuring the time taken for ECC key generation may be able to derive information about the high bits of the secret key, as the function to derive the public point from the secret scalar uses an unblinded Montgomery ladder whose loop iteration count depends on the bitlength of the secret. This issue affects only key generation, not ECDSA signatures or ECDH key agreement.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20187", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBotan Project\u00bbBotanVersions  before (<) 2.9.0cpe:2.3:a:botan_project:botan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-01  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-320", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/320/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://botan.randombit.net/news.html", "ref_desc": "Release Notes \u2014 BotanRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mI8_MIf6F-J2F_xc-jOvL6KLcFM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crocs-muni/ECTester", "ref_desc": "GitHub - crocs-muni/ECTester: Tests support and behavior of elliptic curve cryptography implementations on JavaCards (TYPE_EC_FP and TYPE_EC_F2M) and in selected software libraries.Not Applicable;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://botan.randombit.net/security.html", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories \u2014 BotanVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SRSV0Vrz5tEApabug-uowSQP0d8.html"}]}
