{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9834", "Description": "The Netdata web application through 1.13.0 allows remote attackers to inject their own malicious HTML code into an imported snapshot, aka HTML Injection. Successful exploitation will allow attacker-supplied HTML to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. NOTE: the vendor disputes the risk because there is a clear warning next to the button for importing a snapshot", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9834", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetdata\u00bbNetdataVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.13.0cpe:2.3:a:netdata:netdata:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.91%  3.16%  +1.25 \n 2  2024-08-05  2.37%  1.91%  -0.46 \n 3  2024-06-23  1.84%  2.37%  +0.53 \n 4  2024-03-26  3.10%  1.84%  -1.26 \n 5  2024-03-08  2.11%  3.10%  +0.99 \n 6  2024-02-22  1.53%  2.11%  +0.57 \n 7  2024-02-04  1.32%  1.53%  +0.21 \n 8  2024-01-19  1.41%  1.32%  -0.08 \n 9  2023-03-07  8.38%  1.41%  -6.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46545", "ref_desc": "NetData 1.13.0 - HTML InjectionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/5800#issuecomment-510986112", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-9834 \u00b7 Issue #5800 \u00b7 netdata/netdata \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSG93yX0B8k", "ref_desc": "Netdata v1.12.2 HTML Injection Vulnerability - YouTubeExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
