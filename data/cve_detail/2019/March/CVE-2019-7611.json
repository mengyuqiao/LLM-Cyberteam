{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7611", "Description": "A permission issue was found in Elasticsearch versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 when Field Level Security and Document Level Security are disabled and the _aliases, _shrink, or _split endpoints are used . If the elasticsearch.yml file has xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled set to false, certain permission checks are skipped when users perform one of the actions mentioned above, to make existing data available under a new index/alias name. This could result in an attacker gaining additional permissions against a restricted index.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7611", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbElasticsearchVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.6.1cpe:2.3:a:elastic:elasticsearch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nElastic\u00bbElasticsearchVersions  before (<) 5.6.15cpe:2.3:a:elastic:elasticsearch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-6-6-1-and-5-6-15-security-update/169077", "ref_desc": "Elastic Stack 6.6.1 and 5.6.15 security update - Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lYDPvouWskO2BVZ_9I1LvE8DQ30.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.elastic.co/community/security", "ref_desc": "Elastic Stack Security Disclosures \u00b7 Report Issues | ElasticVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RMrGSY_VFXOZ71yMK5E8GE1-n1E.html"}]}
