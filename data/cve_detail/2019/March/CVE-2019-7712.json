{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7712", "Description": "An issue was discovered in handler_ipcom_shell_pwd in the Interpeak IPCOMShell TELNET server on Green Hills INTEGRITY RTOS 5.0.4. When using the pwd command, the current working directory path is used as the first argument to printf() without a proper check. An attacker may thus forge a path containing format string modifiers to get a custom format string evaluated. This results in an information leak of memory addresses.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7712", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGHS\u00bbIntegrity Rtos\u00bbVersion:5.0.4cpe:2.3:o:ghs:integrity_rtos:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-134 Use of Externally-Controlled Format String", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/134/Use-of-Externally-Controlled-Format-String.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.ghs.com/products/rtos/integrity.html", "ref_desc": "INTEGRITY Real-time Operating SystemVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iVi_p2JSQYbpI1OdIlt50BsEFVU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bl4ckic3/GHS-Bugs", "ref_desc": "GitHub - bl4ckic3/GHS-Bugs: List of Vulnerabilities in Integrity RTOSThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JOd23lJolfAcEVs5O5zf2Ab_WDk.html"}]}
