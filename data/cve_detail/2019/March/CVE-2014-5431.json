{"CVE Code": "CVE-2014-5431", "Description": "Baxter SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System version 6.05 (model 35700BAX) with wireless battery module (WBM) version 16 contains a hard-coded password, which provides access to basic biomedical information, limited device settings, and network configuration of the WBM, if connected. The hard-coded password may allow an attacker with physical access to the device to access management functions to make unauthorized configuration changes to biomedical settings such as turn on and off wireless connections and the phase-complete audible alarm that indicates the end of an infusion phase. Baxter has released a new version of the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System, version 8, which incorporates hardware and software changes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-5431", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBaxter\u00bbSigma Spectrum Infusion System Firmware\u00bbVersion:6.05cpe:2.3:o:baxter:sigma_spectrum_infusion_system_firmware:6.05:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Baxter\u00bbSigma Spectrum Infusion System\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Baxter\u00bbWireless Battery Module\u00bbVersion:16", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-259 Use of Hard-coded Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/259/Use-of-Hard-coded-Password.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-15-181-01", "ref_desc": "Baxter SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System Vulnerabilities | CISAMitigation;US Government Resource;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jJIHjz4SnJJzSMFIy_CK8PDTNko.html"}]}
