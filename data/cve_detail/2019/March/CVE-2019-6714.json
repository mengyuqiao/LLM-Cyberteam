{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6714", "Description": "An issue was discovered in BlogEngine.NET through 3.3.6.0. A path traversal and Local File Inclusion vulnerability in PostList.ascx.cs can cause unauthenticated users to load a PostView.ascx component from a potentially untrusted location on the local filesystem. This is especially dangerous if an authenticated user uploads a PostView.ascx file using the file manager utility, which is currently allowed. This results in remote code execution for an authenticated user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6714", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;File inclusion;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nBlogengine\u00bbBlogengine.netVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.3.6.0cpe:2.3:a:blogengine:blogengine.net:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "15.96% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.53%  15.96%  +13.44 \n 2  2024-08-07  2.99%  2.53%  -0.46 \n 3  2023-05-08  3.34%  2.99%  -0.35 \n 4  2023-03-07  12.75%  3.34%  -9.41 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blogengine.io/", "ref_desc": "BlogEngine | Create a beautiful and professional blog!ProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4psdBZzzmkqDswqpB1QliT8rH_Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rxtur/BlogEngine.NET/", "ref_desc": "GitHub - rxtur/BlogEngine.NET: Multi-User ASP.NET Blogging ApplicationProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jun/26", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: BlogEngine.NET Directory traversal + RCECVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GYAGccEdDnM3vG9nYOin63zkOf8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46353/", "ref_desc": "BlogEngine.NET 3.3.6 - Directory Traversal / Remote Code ExecutionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/151628/BlogEngine.NET-3.3.6-Directory-Traversal-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "BlogEngine.NET 3.3.6 Directory Traversal / Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;VDB Entry;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
