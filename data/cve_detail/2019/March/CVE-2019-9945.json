{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9945", "Description": "SoftNAS Cloud 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 allows remote command execution. The NGINX default configuration file has a check to verify the status of a user cookie. If not set, a user is redirected to the login page. An arbitrary value can be provided for this cookie to access the web interface without valid user credentials. If customers have not followed SoftNAS deployment best practices and expose SoftNAS StorageCenter ports directly to the internet, this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to the Webadmin interface to create new users or execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges, compromising both the platform and the data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9945", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSoftnas\u00bbCloud\u00bbVersion:4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:softnas:cloud:4.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSoftnas\u00bbCloud\u00bbVersion:4.2.1cpe:2.3:a:softnas:cloud:4.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.56%  0.37%  -0.19 \n 2  2023-05-02  0.41%  0.56%  +0.15 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.41%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.digitaldefense.com/blog/2019-softnas-cloud-zero-day-blog/", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
