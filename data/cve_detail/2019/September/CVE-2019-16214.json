{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16214", "Description": "Libra Core before 2019-09-03 has an erroneous regular expression for inline comments, which makes it easier for attackers to interfere with code auditing by using a nonstandard line-break character for a comment. For example, a Move module author can enter the // sequence (which introduces a single-line comment), followed by very brief comment text, the \\r character, and code that has security-critical functionality. In many popular environments, this code is displayed on a separate line, and thus a reader may infer that the code is executed. However, the code is NOT executed, because language/compiler/ir_to_bytecode/src/parser.rs allows the comment to continue after the \\r character.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16214", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLibra\u00bbLibra CoreVersions  before (<) 2019-09-03cpe:2.3:a:libra:libra_core:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-09-04  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/libra/libra/commit/7efb0221989f17fdf7f8486730898ed947a1e19e", "ref_desc": "[language] Restrict character classes allowed in IR \u00b7 libra/libra@7efb022 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.openzeppelin.com/libra-vulnerability-release/", "ref_desc": "OpenZeppelin Uncovers Vulnerability in Libra\u2019s Move IR Compiler \u2013 OpenZeppelin blogThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.openzeppelin.com/libra-vulnerability-summary/", "ref_desc": "Libra\u2019s Move IR Compiler Vulnerability: Technical Description \u2013 OpenZeppelin blogExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
