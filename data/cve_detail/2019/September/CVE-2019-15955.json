A low privilege user can perform a simple transformation of a cookie to obtain the random values inside it. If an attacker can discover a session cookie owned by an admin, then it is possible to brute force it with O(n)=2n instead of O(n)=n^x complexity, and steal the admin password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15955", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTotaljs\u00bbTotal.js Cms\u00bbVersion:12.0.0cpe:2.3:a:totaljs:total.js_cms:12.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-23  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-04-19  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/beerpwn/CVE/blob/master/Totaljs_disclosure_report/report_final.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVE/report_final.pdf at master \u00b7 beerpwn/CVE \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2_96ZCgIDPrf_CbLIiFUwLdowcY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Sep/3", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Totaljs CMS Insecure Admin Session cookieExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
