{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11496", "Description": "In versions of Couchbase Server prior to 5.0, the bucket named \"default\" was a special bucket that allowed read and write access without authentication. As part of 5.0, the behavior of all buckets including \"default\" were changed to only allow access by authenticated users with sufficient authorization. However, users were allowed unauthenticated and unauthorized access to the \"default\" bucket if the properties of this bucket were edited. This has been fixed in versions 5.1.0 and 5.5.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11496", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nCouchbase\u00bbCouchbase ServerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:couchbase:couchbase_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.couchbase.com/resources/security#SecurityAlerts", "ref_desc": "Enterprise-Level Security | CouchbaseVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0wuAKaJW6IaJNfEXpyVp6fcL8wU.html"}]}
