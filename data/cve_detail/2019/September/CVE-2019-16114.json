{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16114", "Description": "In ATutor 2.2.4, an unauthenticated attacker can change the application settings and force it to use his crafted database, which allows him to gain access to the application. Next, he can change the directory that the application uploads files to, which allows him to achieve remote code execution. This occurs because install/include/header.php does not restrict certain changes (to db_host, db_login, db_password, and content_dir) within install/include/step5.php.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16114", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAtutor\u00bbAtutorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.4cpe:2.3:a:atutor:atutor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.57%  2.39%  +0.82 \n 2  2023-10-19  1.12%  1.57%  +0.46 \n 3  2023-06-29  0.98%  1.12%  +0.13 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.98%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MostafaSoliman/Security-Advisories/blob/master/CVE-2019-16114/README.md", "ref_desc": "Security-Advisories/README.md at master \u00b7 MostafaSoliman/Security-Advisories \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/atutor/ATutor/commits/master", "ref_desc": "Commits \u00b7 atutor/ATutor \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
