{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11497", "Description": "In Couchbase Server 5.0.0, when an invalid Remote Cluster Certificate was entered as part of the reference creation, XDCR did not parse and check the certificate signature. It then accepted the invalid certificate and attempted to use it to establish future connections to the remote cluster. This has been fixed in version 5.5.0. XDCR now checks the validity of the certificate thoroughly and prevents a remote cluster reference from being created with an invalid certificate.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11497", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCouchbase\u00bbCouchbase Server\u00bbVersion:5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:couchbase:couchbase_server:5.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.couchbase.com/resources/security#SecurityAlerts", "ref_desc": "Enterprise-Level Security | CouchbaseVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0wuAKaJW6IaJNfEXpyVp6fcL8wU.html"}]}
