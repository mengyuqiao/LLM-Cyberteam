{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11467", "Description": "In Couchbase Server 4.6.3 and 5.5.0, secondary indexing encodes the entries to be indexed using collatejson. When index entries contain certain characters like \\t, <, >, it caused buffer overrun as encoded string would be much larger than accounted for, causing indexer service to crash and restart. This has been remedied in versions 5.1.2 and 5.5.2 to ensure buffer always grows as needed for any input.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11467", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nCouchbase\u00bbCouchbase Server\u00bbVersion:5.5.0cpe:2.3:a:couchbase:couchbase_server:5.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCouchbase\u00bbCouchbase Server\u00bbVersion:4.6.3cpe:2.3:a:couchbase:couchbase_server:4.6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.couchbase.com/resources/security#SecurityAlerts", "ref_desc": "Enterprise-Level Security | CouchbaseVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0wuAKaJW6IaJNfEXpyVp6fcL8wU.html"}]}
