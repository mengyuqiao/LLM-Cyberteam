{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14224", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Alfresco Community Edition 5.2 201707. By leveraging multiple components in the Alfresco Software applications, an exploit chain was observed that allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the victim machine. The attacker must upload malicious Solr configuration files and then receive a JMX connection from the victim, and serve a Java object that results in deserialization and code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14224", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAlfresco\u00bbAlfresco\u00bbVersion:5.2    CommunityEditioncpe:2.3:a:alfresco:alfresco:5.2:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.64%  0.52%  -0.12 \n 2  2023-10-15  0.47%  0.64%  +0.17 \n 3  2023-06-25  0.42%  0.47%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-05-23  0.31%  0.42%  +0.11 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.31%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-14224-Authenticated%20Remote%20Code%20Execution-Alfresco%20Community", "ref_desc": "Disclosures/CVE-2019-14224-Authenticated Remote Code Execution-Alfresco Community at master \u00b7 DrunkenShells/Disclosures \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
