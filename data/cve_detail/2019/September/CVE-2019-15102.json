{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15102", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Tyto Sahi Pro 6.x through 8.0.0. TestRunner_Non_distributed (and distributed end points) does not have any authentication mechanism. This allow an attacker to execute an arbitrary script on the remote Sahi Pro server. There is also a password-protected web interface intended for remote access to scripts. This web interface lacks server-side validation, which allows an attacker to create/modify/delete a script remotely without any password. Chaining both of these issues results in remote code execution on the Sahi Pro server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15102", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSahipro\u00bbSahi ProVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.0.0cpe:2.3:a:sahipro:sahi_pro:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.13%  3.27%  +1.14 \n 2  2023-10-16  1.58%  2.13%  +0.55 \n 3  2023-08-13  1.25%  1.58%  +0.33 \n 4  2023-06-26  1.11%  1.25%  +0.15 \n 5  2023-05-24  0.81%  1.11%  +0.29 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.81%  -0.34 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://barriersec.com/2019/08/cve-2019-15102-sahi-pro/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-15102 \u2013 Sahi pro (Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
