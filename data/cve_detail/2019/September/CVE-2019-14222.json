{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14222", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Alfresco Community Edition versions 6.0 and lower. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could authenticate to Alfresco's Solr Web Admin Interface. The vulnerability is due to the presence of a default private key that is present in all default installations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the extracted private key and bundling it into a PKCS12. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain information about the target system (e.g., OS type, system file locations, Java version, Solr version, etc.) as well as the ability to launch further attacks by leveraging the access to Alfresco's Solr Web Admin Interface.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14222", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAlfresco\u00bbAlfresco\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.0cpe:2.3:a:alfresco:alfresco:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.41%  3.47%  +2.06 \n 2  2023-12-15  1.58%  1.41%  -0.17 \n 3  2023-12-01  1.99%  1.58%  -0.41 \n 4  2023-10-15  1.47%  1.99%  +0.51 \n 5  2023-08-12  1.17%  1.47%  +0.31 \n 6  2023-05-23  1.21%  1.17%  -0.05 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  1.21%  +0.16 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1188/Initialization-of-a-Resource-with-an-Insecure-Default.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-14222-Default%20Certificate-Alfresco%20Community", "ref_desc": "Disclosures/CVE-2019-14222-Default Certificate-Alfresco Community at master \u00b7 DrunkenShells/Disclosures \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
