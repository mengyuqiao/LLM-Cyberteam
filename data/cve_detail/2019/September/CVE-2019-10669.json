{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10669", "Description": "An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. There is a command injection vulnerability in html/includes/graphs/device/collectd.inc.php where user supplied parameters are filtered with the mysqli_escape_real_string function. This function is not the appropriate function to sanitize command arguments as it does not escape a number of command line syntax characters such as ` (backtick), allowing an attacker to inject commands into the variable $rrd_cmd, which gets executed via passthru().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10669", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLibrenms\u00bbLibrenmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.47cpe:2.3:a:librenms:librenms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "91.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-18  91.56%  91.49%  -0.08 \n 2  2024-12-17  84.65%  91.56%  +6.91 \n 3  2024-12-02  83.96%  84.65%  +0.69 \n 4  2024-11-13  82.48%  83.96%  +1.48 \n 5  2024-10-26  87.64%  82.48%  -5.16 \n 6  2024-09-20  86.59%  87.64%  +1.05 \n 7  2024-09-02  88.94%  86.59%  -2.35 \n 8  2024-08-18  90.09%  88.94%  -1.15 \n 9  2024-07-31  91.96%  90.09%  -1.87 \n 10  2024-06-29  89.67%  91.96%  +2.29 \n 11  2024-05-26  88.66%  89.67%  +1.00 \n 12  2024-05-06  89.62%  88.66%  -0.96 \n 13  2024-04-24  87.60%  89.62%  +2.02 \n 14  2024-03-22  86.67%  87.60%  +0.93 \n 15  2024-03-07  87.03%  86.67%  -0.36 \n 16  2024-02-20  87.47%  87.03%  -0.44 \n 17  2024-01-21  89.69%  87.47%  -2.21 \n 18  2023-12-19  92.33%  89.69%  -2.65 \n 19  2023-11-19  92.80%  92.33%  -0.46 \n 20  2023-11-05  92.39%  92.80%  +0.40 \n 21  2023-10-19  92.04%  92.39%  +0.35 \n 22  2023-10-03  92.85%  92.04%  -0.80 \n 23  2023-09-16  93.63%  92.85%  -0.78 \n 24  2023-09-02  93.47%  93.63%  +0.15 \n 25  2023-08-16  93.72%  93.47%  -0.25 \n 26  2023-07-14  93.74%  93.72%  -0.02 \n 27  2023-06-29  93.29%  93.74%  +0.45 \n 28  2023-06-11  93.08%  93.29%  +0.21 \n 29  2023-05-27  92.60%  93.08%  +0.48 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/librenms-command-injection-vulnerability-xl-19-017/", "ref_desc": "404 Not FoundExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154391/LibreNMS-Collectd-Command-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "LibreNMS Collectd Command Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
