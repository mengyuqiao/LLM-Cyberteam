{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11465", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Couchbase Server 5.5.x through 5.5.3 and 6.0.0. The Memcached \"connections\" stat block command emits a non-redacted username. The system information submitted to Couchbase as part of a bug report included the usernames for all users currently logged into the system even if the log was redacted for privacy. This has been fixed (in 5.5.4 and 6.0.1) so that usernames are tagged properly in the logs and are hashed out when the logs are redacted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11465", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCouchbase\u00bbCouchbase ServerVersions  from including (>=) 5.5.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.5.3cpe:2.3:a:couchbase:couchbase_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCouchbase\u00bbCouchbase Server\u00bbVersion:6.0.0cpe:2.3:a:couchbase:couchbase_server:6.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.couchbase.com/resources/security#SecurityAlerts", "ref_desc": "Enterprise-Level Security | CouchbaseVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0wuAKaJW6IaJNfEXpyVp6fcL8wU.html"}]}
