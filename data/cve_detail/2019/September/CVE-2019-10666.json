{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10666", "Description": "An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. Several of the scripts perform dynamic script inclusion via the include() function on user supplied input without sanitizing the values by calling basename() or a similar function. An attacker can leverage this to execute PHP code from the included file. Exploitation of these scripts is made difficult by additional text being appended (typically .inc.php), which means an attacker would need to be able to control both a filename and its content on the server. However, exploitation can be achieved as demonstrated by the csv.php?report=../ substring.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10666", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nLibrenms\u00bbLibrenmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.47cpe:2.3:a:librenms:librenms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.87% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.47%  0.87%  +0.40 \n 2  2023-08-16  0.66%  0.47%  -0.19 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.66%  -0.23 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/librenms-limited-local-file-inclusion-via-directory-traversal-vulnerability-xl-19-020/", "ref_desc": "404 Not FoundExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
