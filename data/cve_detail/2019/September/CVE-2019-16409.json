{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16409", "Description": "In the Versioned Files module through 2.0.3 for SilverStripe 3.x, unpublished versions of files are publicly exposed to anyone who can guess their URL. This guess could be highly informed by a basic understanding of the symbiote/silverstripe-versionedfiles source code. (Users who upgrade from SilverStripe 3.x to 4.x and had Versioned Files installed have no further need for this module, because the 4.x release has built-in versioning. However, nothing in the upgrade process automates the destruction of these insecure artefacts, nor alerts the user to the criticality of destruction.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16409", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSilverstripe\u00bbSilverstripeVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.7.4cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:silverstripe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSymbiote\u00bbVersionedfiles\u00bbForSilverstripeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:symbiote:versionedfiles:*:*:*:*:*:silverstripe:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.14%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-09-19  0.14%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-07-31  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-07-16  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-versionedfiles", "ref_desc": "GitHub - symbiote/silverstripe-versionedfiles: A module to allow for the replacement and version management of asset files.Product;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2019-16409", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-16409 secureassets and versionedfiles modules can expose versions of protected files \u00bb SilverStripeVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework", "ref_desc": "GitHub - silverstripe/silverstripe-framework: SilverStripe Framework, the MVC framework that powers SilverStripe CMSProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
