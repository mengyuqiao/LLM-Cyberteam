{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12648", "Description": "A vulnerability in the IOx application environment for Cisco IOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Guest Operating System (Guest OS) running on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect role-based access control (RBAC) evaluation when a low-privileged user requests access to a Guest OS that should be restricted to administrative accounts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the Guest OS by using the low-privileged-user credentials. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Guest OS as a root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12648", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIOS\u00bbVersion:15.7(3)m3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.7\\(3\\)m3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb807 Industrial Integrated Services Routers\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCgr 1120\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCgr1240\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-05  0.19%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.19%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-ios-gos-auth", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOx for IOS Software Guest Operating System Unauthorized Access VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
