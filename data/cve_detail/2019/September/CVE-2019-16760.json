{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16760", "Description": "Cargo prior to Rust 1.26.0 may download the wrong dependency if your package.toml file uses the `package` configuration key. Usage of the `package` key to rename dependencies in `Cargo.toml` is ignored in Rust 1.25.0 and prior. When Rust 1.25.0 and prior is used Cargo may download the wrong dependency, which could be squatted on crates.io to be a malicious package. This not only affects manifests that you write locally yourself, but also manifests published to crates.io. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.25.0 is affected by this advisory because Cargo will ignore the `package` key in manifests. Rust 1.26.0 through Rust 1.30.0 are not affected and typically will emit an error because the `package` key is unstable. Rust 1.31.0 and after are not affected because Cargo understands the `package` key. Users of the affected versions are strongly encouraged to update their compiler to the latest available one. Preventing this issue from happening requires updating your compiler to be either Rust 1.26.0 or newer. There will be no point release for Rust versions prior to 1.26.0. Users of Rust 1.19.0 to Rust 1.25.0 can instead apply linked patches to mitigate the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16760", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRust-lang\u00bbRustVersions  before (<) 1.26.0cpe:2.3:a:rust-lang:rust:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.31%  +0.11 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.25%  0.17%  -0.09 \n 4  2023-06-17  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.22%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-16", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/16/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-494 Download of Code Without Integrity Check", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/494/Download-of-Code-Without-Integrity-Check.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/security/advisories/GHSA-phjm-8x66-qw4r", "ref_desc": "Cargo prior to Rust 1.26.0 may download the wrong dependency \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-lang/rust \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/10/08/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2019-16760: Cargo prior to Rust 1.26.0 may download the wrong dependency", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rustlang-security-announcements/rVQ5e3TDnpQ", "ref_desc": "Google GroepenExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/pietroalbini/0d293b24a44babbeb6187e06eebd4992", "ref_desc": "Patches for CVE-2019-16760 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
