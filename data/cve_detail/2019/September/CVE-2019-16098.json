{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16098", "Description": "The driver in Micro-Star MSI Afterburner 4.6.2.15658 (aka RTCore64.sys and RTCore32.sys) allows any authenticated user to read and write to arbitrary memory, I/O ports, and MSRs. This can be exploited for privilege escalation, code execution under high privileges, and information disclosure. These signed drivers can also be used to bypass the Microsoft driver-signing policy to deploy malicious code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16098", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMSI\u00bbAfterburner\u00bbVersion:4.6.2.15658cpe:2.3:a:msi:afterburner:4.6.2.15658:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  2.76%  0.05%  -2.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Barakat/CVE-2019-16098", "ref_desc": "GitHub - Barakat/CVE-2019-16098: Local privilege escalation PoC exploit for CVE-2019-16098Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
