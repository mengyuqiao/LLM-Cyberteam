{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15635", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Grafana 5.4.0. Passwords for data sources used by Grafana (e.g., MySQL) are not encrypted. An admin user can reveal passwords for any data source by pressing the \"Save and test\" button within a data source's settings menu. When watching the transaction with Burp Proxy, the password for the data source is revealed and sent to the server. From a browser, a prompt to save the credentials is generated, and the password can be revealed by simply checking the \"Show password\" box.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15635", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGrafana\u00bbGrafana\u00bbVersion:5.4.0cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:5.4.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191009-0002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-15635 Grafana Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/167244", "ref_desc": "Grafana information disclosure CVE-2019-15635 Vulnerability ReportThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
