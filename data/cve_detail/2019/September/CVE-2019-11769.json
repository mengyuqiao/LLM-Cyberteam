{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11769", "Description": "An issue was discovered in TeamViewer 14.2.2558. Updating the product as a non-administrative user requires entering administrative credentials into the GUI. Subsequently, these credentials are processed in Teamviewer.exe, which allows any application running in the same non-administrative user context to intercept them in cleartext within process memory. By using this technique, a local attacker is able to obtain administrative credentials in order to elevate privileges. This vulnerability can be exploited by injecting code into Teamviewer.exe which intercepts calls to GetWindowTextW and logs the processed credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11769", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTeamviewer\u00bbTeamviewer\u00bbVersion:14.2.2558cpe:2.3:a:teamviewer:teamviewer:14.2.2558:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://community.teamviewer.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/tkb-p/Knowledgebase?type=label&labels=Security", "ref_desc": "Knowledge Base - Become a TeamViewer ExpertProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.to.com/advisory-teamviewer-cve-2019-11769-2/", "ref_desc": "Advisory Teamviewer 14.2.2558 - CVE-2019-11769 - TO BlogThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
