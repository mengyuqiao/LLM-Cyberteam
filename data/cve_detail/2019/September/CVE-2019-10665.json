{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10665", "Description": "An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. The scripts that handle the graphing options (html/includes/graphs/common.inc.php and html/includes/graphs/graphs.inc.php) do not sufficiently validate or encode several fields of user supplied input. Some parameters are filtered with mysqli_real_escape_string, which is only useful for preventing SQL injection attacks; other parameters are unfiltered. This allows an attacker to inject RRDtool syntax with newline characters via the html/graph.php script. RRDtool syntax is quite versatile and an attacker could leverage this to perform a number of attacks, including disclosing directory structure and filenames, file content, denial of service, or writing arbitrary files.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10665", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLibrenms\u00bbLibrenmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.47cpe:2.3:a:librenms:librenms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.47%  +0.17 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.30%  -0.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/librenms-rrdtool-injection-vulnerability-xl-19-023/", "ref_desc": "404 Not FoundExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
