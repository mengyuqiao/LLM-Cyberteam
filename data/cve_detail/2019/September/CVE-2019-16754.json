{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16754", "Description": "RIOT 2019.07 contains a NULL pointer dereference in the MQTT-SN implementation (asymcute), potentially allowing an attacker to crash a network node running RIOT. This requires spoofing an MQTT server response. To do so, the attacker needs to know the MQTT MsgID of a pending MQTT protocol message and the ephemeral port used by RIOT's MQTT implementation. Additionally, the server IP address is required for spoofing the packet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16754", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nRiot-os\u00bbRiot\u00bbVersion:2019.07cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:2019.07:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/12293", "ref_desc": "asymcute: Fix null pointer dereference by nmeum \u00b7 Pull Request #12293 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
