{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16411", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.4. By sending multiple IPv4 packets that have invalid IPv4Options, the function IPV4OptValidateTimestamp in decode-ipv4.c tries to access a memory region that is not allocated. There is a check for o->len < 5 (corresponding to 2 bytes of header and 3 bytes of data). Then, \"flag = *(o->data + 3)\" places one beyond the 3 bytes, because the code should have been \"flag = *(o->data + 1)\" instead.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16411", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSuricata-ids\u00bbSuricata\u00bbVersion:4.1.4cpe:2.3:a:suricata-ids:suricata:4.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.60%  0.58%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.50%  0.60%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-07-29  0.36%  0.50%  +0.14 \n 4  2023-07-14  0.30%  0.36%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.30%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.code-intelligence.com/cve-2019-16411", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-16411 | Code Intelligence", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.openinfosecfoundation.org/pipermail/oisf-announce/", "ref_desc": "The Oisf-announce ArchivesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iwnd63aO71GyTbQAHiTVowT9E1M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://suricata-ids.org/2019/09/24/suricata-4-1-5-released/", "ref_desc": "Suricata 4.1.5 released | SuricataRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zBfRxevQAu1U71S7R4y3Zll8V3k.html"}]}
