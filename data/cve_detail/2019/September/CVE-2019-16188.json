{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16188", "Description": "HCL AppScan Source before 9.03.13 is susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks in multiple locations. In particular, an attacker can send a specially crafted .ozasmt file to a targeted victim and ask the victim to open it. When the victim imports the .ozasmt file in AppScan Source, the content of any file in the local file system (to which the victim as read access) can be exfiltrated to a remote listener under the attacker's control. The product does not disable external XML Entity Processing, which can lead to information disclosure and denial of services attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16188", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nHcltech\u00bbAppscan SourceVersions  before (<) 9.03.13cpe:2.3:a:hcltech:appscan_source:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hclpnpsupport.hcltech.com/csm?id=kb_article&sys_id=0812a9961b0c885077761fc58d4bcb06", "ref_desc": "Knowledge Base - Customer SupportPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
