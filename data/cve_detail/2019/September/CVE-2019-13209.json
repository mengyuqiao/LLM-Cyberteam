The attack requires a victim to be logged into a Rancher server, and then to access a third-party site hosted by the exploiter. Once that is accomplished, the exploiter is able to execute commands against the cluster's Kubernetes API with the permissions and identity of the victim.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13209", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSuse\u00bbRancherVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.2.4cpe:2.3:a:suse:rancher:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://forums.rancher.com/c/announcements", "ref_desc": "Latest Announcements topics - Rancher LabsRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Kdp0bGBoeCWOamEkIP3XwguV6fw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://forums.rancher.com/t/rancher-release-v2-2-5-addresses-rancher-cve-2019-13209/14801", "ref_desc": "Rancher Release - v2.2.5 - Addresses Rancher CVE-2019-13209 - Announcements - Rancher LabsRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
