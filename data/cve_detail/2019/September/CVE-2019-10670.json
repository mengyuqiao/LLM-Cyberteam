{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10670", "Description": "An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. Many of the scripts rely on the function mysqli_escape_real_string for filtering data. However, this is particularly ineffective when returning user supplied input in an HTML or a JavaScript context, resulting in unsafe data being injected into these contexts, leading to attacker controlled JavaScript executing in the browser. One example of this is the string parameter in html/pages/inventory.inc.php.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10670", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nLibrenms\u00bbLibrenmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.47cpe:2.3:a:librenms:librenms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/librenms-multiple-reflected-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-xl-19-021/", "ref_desc": "404 Not FoundExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
