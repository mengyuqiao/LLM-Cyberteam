{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16303", "Description": "A class generated by the Generator in JHipster before 6.3.0 and JHipster Kotlin through 1.1.0 produces code that uses an insecure source of randomness (apache.commons.lang3 RandomStringUtils). This allows an attacker (if able to obtain their own password reset URL) to compute the value for all other password resets for other accounts, thus allowing privilege escalation or account takeover.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16303", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nJhipster\u00bbJhipster KotlinVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:jhipster:jhipster_kotlin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJhipster\u00bbJhipsterVersions  before (<) 6.3.0cpe:2.3:a:jhipster:jhipster:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.70% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.04%  1.70%  -0.35 \n 2  2024-09-06  1.63%  2.04%  +0.41 \n 3  2024-01-07  1.65%  1.63%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.94%  1.65%  +0.71 \n 5  2023-08-20  0.82%  0.94%  +0.12 \n 6  2023-08-04  0.60%  0.82%  +0.22 \n 7  2023-05-31  0.74%  0.60%  -0.14 \n 8  2023-05-08  0.56%  0.74%  +0.18 \n 9  2023-04-27  0.65%  0.56%  -0.09 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.18%  0.65%  -0.53 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r6d243e7e3f25daeb242dacf3def411fba32a9388d3ff84918cb28ddd@%3Cissues.commons.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[jira] [Created] (LANG-1607) To aid with CVE-2019-16303, consider upgrading RandomStringUtils default RNG - Pony MailMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/security/advisories/GHSA-mwp6-j9wf-968c", "ref_desc": "Account takeover and privilege escalation is possible in applications generated by generator-jhipster before 6.3.0. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jhipster/generator-jhipster \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/commit/88448b85fd3e8e49df103f0061359037c2c68ea7", "ref_desc": "use new SecureRandom which uses non blocking /dev/urandom \u00b7 jhipster/generator-jhipster@88448b8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc3f00f5d3d2ec0e2381a3b9096d5f5b4d46ec1587ee7e251a3dbb897@%3Cissues.commons.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Pony Mail!Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10401", "ref_desc": "Bug bounty for security advisory - thank you @JLLeitschuh \u00b7 Issue #10401 \u00b7 jhipster/generator-jhipster \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc87fa35a48b5d70b06af6fb81785ed82e82686eb83307aae6d250dc9@%3Cissues.commons.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[jira] [Commented] (LANG-1607) To aid with CVE-2019-16303, consider upgrading RandomStringUtils default RNG - Pony MailMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/issues/183", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] CWE-338: Vulnerability in JHipster Kotlin \u00b7 Issue #183 \u00b7 jhipster/jhipster-kotlin \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.jhipster.tech/2019/09/13/jhipster-release-6.3.0.html", "ref_desc": "Release 6.3.0Release Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
