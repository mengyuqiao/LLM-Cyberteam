{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13063", "Description": "Within Sahi Pro 8.0.0, an attacker can send a specially crafted URL to include any victim files on the system via the script parameter on the Script_view page. This will result in file disclosure (i.e., being able to pull any file from the remote victim application). This can be used to steal and obtain sensitive config and other files. This can result in complete compromise of the application. The script parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal and both local and remote file inclusion.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13063", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nSahipro\u00bbSahi Pro\u00bbVersion:8.0.0cpe:2.3:a:sahipro:sahi_pro:8.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "43.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  17.17%  43.80%  +26.63 \n 2  2024-10-21  12.89%  17.17%  +4.28 \n 3  2024-08-14  16.20%  12.89%  -3.30 \n 4  2024-05-20  18.42%  16.20%  -2.23 \n 5  2023-11-02  14.42%  18.42%  +4.00 \n 6  2023-05-23  13.57%  14.42%  +0.85 \n 7  2023-03-15  7.11%  13.57%  +6.46 \n 8  2023-03-07  23.85%  7.11%  -16.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sahipro.com/downloads-archive/", "ref_desc": "Download Archives Page - Sahi ProVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IH2kpCdtnuYFcWwHiqv8UV_bOAM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47062", "ref_desc": "Sahi pro 8.x - Directory Traversal - Multiple webapps ExploitExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
