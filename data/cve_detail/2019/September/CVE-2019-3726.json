{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3726", "Description": "An Uncontrolled Search Path Vulnerability is applicable to the following: Dell Update Package (DUP) Framework file versions prior to 19.1.0.413, and Framework file versions prior to 103.4.6.69 used in Dell EMC Servers. Dell Update Package (DUP) Framework file versions prior to 3.8.3.67 used in Dell Client Platforms. The vulnerability is limited to the DUP framework during the time window when a DUP is being executed by an administrator. During this time window, a locally authenticated low privilege malicious user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by tricking an administrator into running a trusted binary, causing it to load a malicious DLL and allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim system. The vulnerability does not affect the actual binary payload that the DUP delivers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3726", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbUpdate Package FrameworkVersions  before (<) 19.1.0.413cpe:2.3:a:dell:update_package_framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dell\u00bbEmc Servers\u00bbVersion:N/A\nDell\u00bbUpdate Package FrameworkVersions  before (<) 3.8.3.67cpe:2.3:a:dell:update_package_framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dell\u00bbClient Platforms\u00bbVersion:N/A\nDell\u00bbUpdate Package FrameworkVersions  before (<) 103.4.6.69cpe:2.3:a:dell:update_package_framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dell\u00bbEmc Servers\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN318693", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
