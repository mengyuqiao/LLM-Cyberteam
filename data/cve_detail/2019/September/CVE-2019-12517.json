{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12517", "Description": "An XSS issue was discovered in the slickquiz plugin through 1.3.7.1 for WordPress. The save_quiz_score functionality available via the /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php endpoint allows unauthenticated users to submit quiz solutions/answers, which are stored in the database and later shown in the WordPress backend for all users with at least Subscriber rights. Because the plugin does not properly validate and sanitize this data, a malicious payload in either the name or email field is executed directly within the backend at /wp-admin/admin.php?page=slickquiz across all users with the privileges of at least Subscriber.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12517", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSlickquiz Project\u00bbSlickquiz\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.7.1cpe:2.3:a:slickquiz_project:slickquiz:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.39%  +0.24 \n 2  2024-09-24  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154439/WordPress-SlickQuiz-1.3.7.1-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "WordPress SlickQuiz 1.3.7.1 Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/slickquiz/#developers", "ref_desc": "SlickQuiz \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.orgProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s44ZySOnMxY4hH6Gy3boW4pH1UI.html"}]}
