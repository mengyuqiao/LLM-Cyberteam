{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16230", "Description": "drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_display.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: A third-party software maintainer states that the work queue allocation is happening during device initialization, which for a graphics card occurs during boot. It is not attacker controllable and OOM at that time is highly unlikely", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16230", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:5.2.14cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:5.2.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-04  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191004-0001/", "ref_desc": "September 2019 Linux Kernel Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DgPDEnsw9bCRJutC9RJ_LOSG8Bw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1150468", "ref_desc": "Bug 1150468 \u2013 VUL-1: DISPUTED: CVE-2019-16230: kernel-source: NULL pointer dereference in alloc_workqueue in drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_display.cIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/9/487", "ref_desc": "LKML: Semmle Security Reports: Multiple NULL deref on alloc_workqueuePatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Ud62GYbuF5giRP3YJuvqjPf8Hr0.html"}]}
