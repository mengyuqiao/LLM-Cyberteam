{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15952", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Total.js CMS 12.0.0. An authenticated user with the Pages privilege can conduct a path traversal attack (../) to include .html files that are outside the permitted directory. Also, if a page contains a template directive, then the directive will be server side processed. Thus, if a user can control the content of a .html file, then they can inject a payload with a malicious template directive to gain Remote Command Execution. The exploit will work only with the .html extension.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15952", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nTotaljs\u00bbTotal.js Cms\u00bbVersion:12.0.0cpe:2.3:a:totaljs:total.js_cms:12.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.48%  2.40%  +0.92 \n 2  2024-08-29  1.21%  1.48%  +0.28 \n 3  2023-05-23  1.04%  1.21%  +0.16 \n 4  2023-04-19  0.86%  1.04%  +0.19 \n 5  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.86%  -3.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/beerpwn/CVE/blob/master/Totaljs_disclosure_report/report_final.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVE/report_final.pdf at master \u00b7 beerpwn/CVE \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2_96ZCgIDPrf_CbLIiFUwLdowcY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Sep/2", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Totaljs CMS authenticated path traversal (could lead to RCE)Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154340/Totaljs-CMS-12.0-Path-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Totaljs CMS 12.0 Path Traversal \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Sep/11", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Re: Totaljs CMS authenticated path traversal (could lead to RCE)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
