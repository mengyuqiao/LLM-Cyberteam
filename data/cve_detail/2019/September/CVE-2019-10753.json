{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10753", "Description": "In all versions prior to version 3.9.6 for eclipse-wtp, all versions prior to version 9.4.4 for eclipse-cdt, and all versions prior to version 3.0.1 for eclipse-groovy, Spotless was resolving dependencies over an insecure channel (http). If the build occurred over an insecure connection, a malicious user could have perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the build and alter the build artifacts that were produced. In case that any of these artifacts were compromised, any developers using these could be altered. **Note:** In order to validate that this artifact was not compromised, the maintainer would need to confirm that none of the artifacts published to the registry were not altered with. Until this happens, we can not guarantee that this artifact was not compromised even though the probability that this happened is low.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10753", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDiffplug\u00bbEclipse-groovy\u00bbForSpotlessVersions  before (<) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:diffplug:eclipse-groovy:*:*:*:*:*:spotless:*:*Matching versions\nDiffplug\u00bbEclipse-cdt\u00bbForSpotlessVersions  before (<) 9.4.4cpe:2.3:a:diffplug:eclipse-cdt:*:*:*:*:*:spotless:*:*Matching versions\nDiffplug\u00bbEclipse-wtp\u00bbForSpotlessVersions  before (<) 3.9.6cpe:2.3:a:diffplug:eclipse-wtp:*:*:*:*:*:spotless:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-669 Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/669/Incorrect-Resource-Transfer-Between-Spheres.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMDIFFPLUGSPOTLESS-460377", "ref_desc": "Unsafe Dependancy Resolution in com.diffplug.spotless:spotless-eclipse-wtp | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
