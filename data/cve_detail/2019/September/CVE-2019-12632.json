{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12632", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected system does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to a user of the web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the system and perform unauthorized actions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12632", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFinesse\u00bbVersion:12.5(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:finesse:12.5\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFinesse\u00bbVersion:11.6(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:finesse:11.6\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFinesse\u00bbVersion:12.0(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:finesse:12.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190904-finesse-ssrf", "ref_desc": "Cisco Finesse Request Processing Server-Side Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
