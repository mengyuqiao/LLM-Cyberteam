{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15949", "Description": "Nagios XI before 5.6.6 allows remote command execution as root. The exploit requires access to the server as the nagios user, or access as the admin user via the web interface. The getprofile.sh script, invoked by downloading a system profile (profile.php?cmd=download), is executed as root via a passwordless sudo entry; the script executes check_plugin, which is owned by the nagios user. A user logged into Nagios XI with permissions to modify plugins, or the nagios user on the server, can modify the check_plugin executable and insert malicious commands to execute as root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15949", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNagios\u00bbNagios XiVersions  before (<) 5.6.6cpe:2.3:a:nagios:nagios_xi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "93.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  28.54%  93.35%  +64.82 \n 2  2024-11-27  32.74%  28.54%  -4.20 \n 3  2024-11-09  45.96%  32.74%  -13.22 \n 4  2024-10-03  51.56%  45.96%  -5.61 \n 5  2024-08-29  51.53%  51.56%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-07-27  44.23%  51.53%  +7.29 \n 7  2024-06-25  41.12%  44.23%  +3.11 \n 8  2024-04-20  35.52%  41.12%  +5.60 \n 9  2024-03-31  39.43%  35.52%  -3.90 \n 10  2024-02-16  45.42%  39.43%  -5.99 \n 11  2024-02-01  51.21%  45.42%  -5.79 \n 12  2023-12-30  51.94%  51.21%  -0.74 \n 13  2023-12-01  45.15%  51.94%  +6.79 \n 14  2023-10-31  49.69%  45.15%  -4.53 \n 15  2023-09-29  42.29%  49.69%  +7.40 \n 16  2023-09-12  38.75%  42.29%  +3.54 \n 17  2023-08-29  40.29%  38.75%  -1.54 \n 18  2023-07-27  41.69%  40.29%  -1.40 \n 19  2023-07-08  48.94%  41.69%  -7.25 \n 20  2023-06-25  45.70%  48.94%  +3.24 \n 21  2023-06-07  47.91%  45.70%  -2.21 \n 22  2023-05-08  42.62%  47.91%  +5.29 \n 23  2023-04-19  41.29%  42.62%  +1.33 \n 24  2023-03-15  34.70%  41.29%  +6.59 \n 25  2023-03-07  60.89%  34.70%  -26.19 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162158/Nagios-XI-getprofile.sh-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Nagios XI getprofile.sh Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jakgibb/nagiosxi-root-rce-exploit", "ref_desc": "GitHub - jakgibb/nagiosxi-root-rce-exploit: POC which exploits a vulnerability within Nagios XI (5.6.5) to spawn a root shellExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156676/Nagios-XI-Authenticated-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Nagios XI Authenticated Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
