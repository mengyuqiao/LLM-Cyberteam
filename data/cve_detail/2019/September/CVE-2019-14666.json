{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14666", "Description": "GLPI through 9.4.3 is prone to account takeover by abusing the ajax/autocompletion.php autocompletion feature. The lack of correct validation leads to recovery of the token generated via the password reset functionality, and thus an authenticated attacker can set an arbitrary password for any user. This vulnerability can be exploited to take control of admin account. This vulnerability could be also abused to obtain other sensitive fields like API keys or password hashes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14666", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.4.3cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.20%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-05-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tarlogic.com/advisories/Tarlogic-2019-GPLI-Account-Takeover.txt", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-47hq-pfrr-jh5q", "ref_desc": "Account takeover vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
