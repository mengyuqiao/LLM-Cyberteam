{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16216", "Description": "Zulip server before 2.0.5 incompletely validated the MIME types of uploaded files. A user who is logged into the server could upload files of certain types to mount a stored cross-site scripting attack on other logged-in users. On a Zulip server using the default local uploads backend, the attack is only effective against browsers lacking support for Content-Security-Policy such as Internet Explorer 11. On a Zulip server using the S3 uploads backend, the attack is confined to the origin of the configured S3 uploads hostname and cannot reach the Zulip server itself.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16216", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulip ServerVersions  from including (>=) 1.8.0andbefore (<) 2.0.5cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.zulip.org/2019/09/11/zulip-server-2-0-5-security-release/", "ref_desc": "Zulip Server 2.0.5 security releaseVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/beLPX1iqK3Wpzmi6QtlSyuQ3kJQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/1195841dfb9aa26b3b0dabc6f05d72e4af25be3e", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-16216: Fix MIME type validation. \u00b7 zulip/zulip@1195841 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
