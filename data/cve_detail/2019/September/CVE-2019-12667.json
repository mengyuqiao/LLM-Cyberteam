{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12667", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the web interface to access a malicious link or by intercepting a user request for the affected web interface and injecting malicious code into the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12667", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  from including (>=) 16.1.1andbefore (<) 16.6.5cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  from including (>=) 16.7.1andbefore (<) 16.9.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
