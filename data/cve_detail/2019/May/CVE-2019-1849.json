{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1849", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Patrol (BGP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the affected software processes specific EVPN routing information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the targeted EVPN network. A successful exploit could result in a crash of the l2vpn_mgr process on Provider Edge (PE) device members of the same EVPN instance (EVI). On each of the affected devices, a crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic through the device, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1849", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 6.5.0andbefore (<) 6.5.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 6.1.0andbefore (<) 6.3.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.0andbefore (<) 6.4.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 6.6.0andbefore (<) 6.6.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-iosxr-evpn-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software BGP MPLS-Based EVPN Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108342", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software CVE-2019-1849 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
