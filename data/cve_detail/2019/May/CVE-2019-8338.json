{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-8338", "Description": "The signature verification routine in the Airmail GPG-PGP Plugin, versions 1.0 (9) and earlier, does not verify the status of the signature at all, which allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary email signatures by crafting a signed email with an invalid signature. Also, it does not verify the validity of the signing key, which allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary email signatures by crafting a key with a fake user ID (email address) and injecting it into the user's keyring.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-8338", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGpg-pgp Project\u00bbGpg-pgp\u00bbForAirmailVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0\\(9\\)cpe:2.3:a:gpg-pgp_project:gpg-pgp:*:*:*:*:*:airmail:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.73%  1.27%  -0.46 \n 2  2024-11-15  1.50%  1.73%  +0.24 \n 3  2024-10-06  1.61%  1.50%  -0.11 \n 4  2024-06-13  2.26%  1.61%  -0.66 \n 5  2024-05-09  1.86%  2.26%  +0.41 \n 6  2023-10-12  1.95%  1.86%  -0.09 \n 7  2023-09-09  1.38%  1.95%  +0.57 \n 8  2023-04-22  1.21%  1.38%  +0.17 \n 9  2023-04-06  0.86%  1.21%  +0.36 \n 10  2023-03-20  0.98%  0.86%  -0.12 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.32%  0.98%  -0.34 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152703/Johnny-You-Are-Fired.html", "ref_desc": "Johnny You Are Fired \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eEhKHtomDfdHQ_jDyaJmitbBuBk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Apr/38", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: OpenPGP and S/MIME signature forgery attacks in multiple email clientsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ihza6Ty5A7RfOZin69HgwOqHQ_I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired", "ref_desc": "GitHub - RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired: Artifacts for the USENIX publication.Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OZ3kSFsz1D0Re3iFt6YutLkfog0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Airmail/AirmailPlugIn-Framework/commits/master", "ref_desc": "Commits \u00b7 Airmail/AirmailPlugIn-Framework \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/04/30/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Spoofing OpenPGP and S/MIME Signatures in Emails (multiple clients)Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wgux9oNhO3Yczo_zyrtITAdLPrg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired/blob/master/paper/johnny-fired.pdf", "ref_desc": "Johnny-You-Are-Fired/johnny-fired.pdf at master \u00b7 RUB-NDS/Johnny-You-Are-Fired \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YtqtpjvmZt5P4eqZzKbZf28iXtg.html"}]}
