{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1838", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. This vulnerability has been fixed in software version 14.1(1i).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1838", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbApplication Policy Infrastructure Controller\u00bbVersion:4.0(3d)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_policy_infrastructure_controller:4.0\\(3d\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbApplication Policy Infrastructure Controller\u00bbVersion:3.2(5d)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_policy_infrastructure_controller:3.2\\(5d\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108169", "ref_desc": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller CVE-2019-1838 Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-apic-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Web-Based Management Interface Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
