{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1819", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to download and view files within the application that should be restricted. This vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view application files that may contain sensitive information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1819", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.4cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEvolved Programmable Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:evolved_programmable_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.10%  -0.07 \n 2  2023-08-10  0.25%  0.18%  -0.07 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.39%  0.25%  -0.14 \n 4  2023-06-24  0.39%  0.39%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.18%  0.39%  +0.21 \n 6  2023-03-25  1.46%  0.18%  -1.29 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  1.46%  +0.41 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108351", "ref_desc": "Multiple Cisco Products CVE-2019-1819 Directory Traversal VulnerabilityBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-pi-pathtrav-1819", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Evolved Programmable Network Manager Path Traversal VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
