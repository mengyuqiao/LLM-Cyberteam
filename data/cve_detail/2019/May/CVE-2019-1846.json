{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1846", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain MPLS OAM packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS OAM packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the lspv_server process to crash. The crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic though the device, resulting in a DoS condition that require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1846", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xr\u00bbVersion:5.3.3UpdateSp10cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:5.3.3:sp10:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9000v\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9001\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9006\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9010\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9901\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9904\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9906\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9910\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9912\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9922\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-asr9k-mpls-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers MPLS OAM Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108363", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software CVE-2019-1846 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
