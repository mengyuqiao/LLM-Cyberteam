{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18558", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Espressif ESP-IDF 2.x and 3.x before 3.0.6 and 3.1.x before 3.1.1. Insufficient validation of input data in the 2nd stage bootloader allows a physically proximate attacker to bypass secure boot checks and execute arbitrary code, by crafting an application binary that overwrites a bootloader code segment in process_segment in components/bootloader_support/src/esp_image_format.c. The attack is effective when the flash encryption feature is not enabled, or if the attacker finds a different vulnerability that allows them to write this binary to flash memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18558", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nEspressif\u00bbEsp-idfVersions  from including (>=) 2.0andbefore (<) 3.0.6cpe:2.3:a:espressif:esp-idf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEspressif\u00bbEsp-idfVersions  from including (>=) 3.1andup to, including, (<=) 3.1.1cpe:2.3:a:espressif:esp-idf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.08%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_Product_Security_Advisory_Concerning_Secure_Boot_(CVE-2018-18558)", "ref_desc": "Espressif Product Security Advisory Concerning Secure Boot (CVE-2018-18558) | Espressif SystemsRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 espressif/esp-idf \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
