{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1692", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive system usage information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain components in the underlying Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to observe certain network traffic when accessing the APIC. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access and collect certain tracking data and usage statistics on an affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1692", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbApplication Policy Infrastructure ControllerVersions  before (<) 4.1\\(1i\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_policy_infrastructure_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbApplication Policy Infrastructure Controller\u00bbVersion:8.3(1)s6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_policy_infrastructure_controller:8.3\\(1\\)s6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-apic-info-disc", "ref_desc": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Web-Based Management Interface Usage Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108155", "ref_desc": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
