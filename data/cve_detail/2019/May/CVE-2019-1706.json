{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1706", "Description": "A vulnerability in the software cryptography module of the Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) and Firepower 2100 Series running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device that results in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error with how the software cryptography module handles IPsec sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating and sending traffic in a high number of IPsec sessions through the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload and result in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1706", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Appliance SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 9.9andup to, including, (<=) 9.9.2.50cpe:2.3:o:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa-5506-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa-5506h-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa-5506w-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa-5508-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa-5516-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa-5525-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa-5545-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa-5555-x\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ipsec-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software IPsec Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
