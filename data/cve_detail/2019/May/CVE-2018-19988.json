{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-19988", "Description": "In the /HNAP1/SetClientInfoDemo message, the AudioMute and AudioEnable parameters are vulnerable, and the vulnerabilities affect D-Link DIR-868L Rev.B 2.05B02 devices. In the SetClientInfoDemo.php source code, the AudioMute and AudioEnble parameters are saved in the ShellPath script file without any regex checking. After the script file is executed, the command injection occurs. It needs to bypass the wget command option with a single quote. A vulnerable /HNAP1/SetClientInfoDemo XML message could have single quotes and backquotes in the AudioMute or AudioEnable element, such as the '`telnetd`' string.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19988", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nD-link\u00bbDir-868l Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.05b02cpe:2.3:o:d-link:dir-868l_firmware:2.05b02:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDir-868l\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "54.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  34.97%  54.56%  +19.59 \n 2  2023-08-22  3.26%  34.97%  +31.71 \n 3  2023-08-08  3.98%  3.26%  -0.73 \n 4  2023-07-23  11.62%  3.98%  -7.64 \n 5  2023-04-19  6.73%  11.62%  +4.89 \n 6  2023-03-17  11.21%  6.73%  -4.48 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.06%  11.21%  +9.15 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pr0v3rbs/CVE/tree/master/CVE-2018-19986%20-%2019990", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q_vfD7SyPWHMXJ0YHpDUZqRAits.html"}]}
