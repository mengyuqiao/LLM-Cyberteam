{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5625", "Description": "The Android mobile application Halo Home before 1.11.0 stores OAuth authentication and refresh access tokens in a clear text file. This file persists until the user logs out of the application and reboots the device. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to impersonate the legitimate user by reusing the stored OAuth token, thus allowing them to view and change the user's personal information stored in the backend cloud service. The attacker would first need to gain physical control of the Android device or compromise it with a malicious app.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5625", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEaton\u00bbHalo Home\u00bbVersion:1.9.0ForAndroidcpe:2.3:a:eaton:halo_home:1.9.0:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-922 Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/922/Insecure-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.eaton.com/content/dam/eaton/company/news-insights/cybersecurity/security-bulletins/CVE-2019-5625-Halo-home-smart-lighting-vulnerability-advisory.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.rapid7.com/2019/05/21/investigating-the-plumbing-of-the-iot-ecosystem-r7-2018-65-r7-2019-07-fixed/", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities Disclosed for Eaton and BlueCats IoT DevicesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9q7fkg211QM69YDDtyBYgWD-5rk.html"}]}
