{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1854", "Description": "A vulnerability in the management web interface of Cisco Expressway Series could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory traversal attack against an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass security restrictions and access the web interface of a Cisco Unified Communications Manager associated with the affected device. Valid credentials would still be required to access the Cisco Unified Communications Manager interface.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1854", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Video Communication Server\u00bbVersion:X8.11.4cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_video_communication_server:x8.11.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.44% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-24  0.34%  0.44%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-02-19  0.28%  0.34%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.13%  0.28%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-expressway-traversal", "ref_desc": "Cisco Expressway Series Directory Traversal VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/28", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [RT-SA-2019-002] Directory Traversal in Cisco Expressway Gateway", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108154", "ref_desc": "Cisco Expressway Series CVE-2019-1854 Directory Traversal Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/May/49", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: [RT-SA-2019-002] Directory Traversal in Cisco Expressway Gateway", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152963/Cisco-Expressway-Gateway-11.5.1-Directory-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco Expressway Gateway 11.5.1 Directory Traversal \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
