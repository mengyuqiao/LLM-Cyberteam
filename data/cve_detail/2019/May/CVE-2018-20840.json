{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20840", "Description": "An unhandled exception vulnerability exists during Google Sign-In with Google API C++ Client before 2019-04-10. It potentially causes an outage of third-party services that were not designed to recover from exceptions. On the client, ID token handling can cause an unhandled exception because of misinterpretation of an integer as a string, resulting in denial-of-service and then other users can no longer login/sign-in to the affected third-party service. Once this third-party service uses Google Sign-In with google-api-cpp-client, a malicious user can trigger this client/auth/oauth2_authorization.cc vulnerability by requesting the client to receive the ID token from a Google authentication server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20840", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbApi C++ ClientVersions  before (<) 2019-04-10cpe:2.3:a:google:api_c\\+\\+_client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.09%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/pull/58", "ref_desc": "Fixed 'exp' handling in ID token by sungjungk \u00b7 Pull Request #58 \u00b7 google/google-api-cpp-client \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/issues/57", "ref_desc": "Error on 'exp' type handling in ID Token \u00b7 Issue #57 \u00b7 google/google-api-cpp-client \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
