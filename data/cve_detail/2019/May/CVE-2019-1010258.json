The impact is: Memory corruption leading to at least DoS. More severe impact vectors need more investigation. The component is: it's part of a svg processing library. function nsvg__parseColorRGB in src/nanosvg.h / line 1227. The attack vector is: It depends library usage. If input is passed from the network, then network connectivity is enough. Most likely an attack will require opening a specially crafted .svg file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1010258", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNanosvg Project\u00bbNanosvg\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:nanosvg_project:nanosvg:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-05  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-05-08  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.22%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg/", "ref_desc": "GitHub - memononen/nanosvg: Simple stupid SVG parserThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg/issues/136", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-1000032 - Memory corruption bug in nsvg__parseColorRGB \u00b7 Issue #136 \u00b7 memononen/nanosvg \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://0day.work/cve-2019-1000032-memory-corruption-in-nanosvg/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-1000032: Memory corruption / DoS in nanosvg | Sebastian Neef - 0day.workExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
