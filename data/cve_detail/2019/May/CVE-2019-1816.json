{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1816", "Description": "A vulnerability in the log subscription subsystem of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command injection and elevate privileges to root. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input on the web and command-line interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and injecting scripting commands in the scope of the log subscription subsystem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1816", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:11.0.0-641cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:11.0.0-641:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:10.5.2-072cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:10.5.2-072:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:11.5.0-fcs-614cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:11.5.0-fcs-614:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:Wsa10.5.0-fcs-000cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:wsa10.5.0-fcs-000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.04%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-wsa-privesc", "ref_desc": "Cisco Web Security Appliance Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
