{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1724", "Description": "A vulnerability in the session management functionality of the web-based interface for Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a valid user session on an affected system. An attacker could use this impersonated session to create a new user account or otherwise control the device with the privileges of the hijacked session. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper session management controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take control of an existing user session on the device. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that an authorized user session is active and that the attacker can craft an HTTP request to impersonate that session.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1724", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv320 Dual Gigabit Wan Vpn Router Software\u00bbVersion:1.3.1.12cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv320_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router_software:1.3.1.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv320 Dual Gigabit Wan Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv325 Dual Wan Gigabit Vpn Router Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.3.1.12cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv325_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router_firmware:1.3.1.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv325 Dual Wan Gigabit Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-12  0.16%  0.22%  +0.07 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-sbr-hijack", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Session Hijacking VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
