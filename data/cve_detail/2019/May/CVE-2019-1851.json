{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1851", "Description": "A vulnerability in the External RESTful Services (ERS) API of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to generate arbitrary certificates signed by the Internal Certificate Authority (CA) Services on ISE. This vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of role-based access control (RBAC). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific HTTP request with administrative credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to generate a certificate that is signed and trusted by the ISE CA with arbitrary attributes. The attacker could use this certificate to access other networks or assets that are protected by certificate authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1851", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.2(0.470)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.2\\(0.470\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.3(0.298)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.3\\(0.298\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.4(0.357)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.4\\(0.357\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108356", "ref_desc": "Cisco Identity Services Engine CVE-2019-1851 Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-ise-certcreation", "ref_desc": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Arbitrary Client Certificate Creation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
