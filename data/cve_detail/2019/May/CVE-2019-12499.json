{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12499", "Description": "Firejail before 0.9.60 allows truncation (resizing to length 0) of the firejail binary on the host by running exploit code inside a firejail sandbox and having the sandbox terminated. To succeed, certain conditions need to be fulfilled: The jail (with the exploit code inside) needs to be started as root, and it also needs to be terminated as root from the host (either by stopping it ungracefully (e.g., SIGKILL), or by using the --shutdown control command). This is similar to CVE-2019-5736.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12499", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFirejail Project\u00bbFirejail\u00bbVersions  before (<) 0.9.60cpe:2.3:a:firejail_project:firejail:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.45%  0.35%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-05-24  0.38%  0.45%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-04-04  0.27%  0.38%  +0.10 \n 4  2023-03-20  0.23%  0.27%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.23%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RGVULJ6IKVDO6UAVIQRHQVSKOUD6QDWM/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: firejail-0.9.62-1.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BtHmrGpdw4je3Q9rToPYdVwM6u8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CDY7B73YDRBURA25APSHD5PFEO4TNSFW/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 30 Update: firejail-0.9.62-1.fc30 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RfCDLIJ6ZZ2Mjxq_bgFmE_ZXjls.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/2401", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-5736 \u00b7 Issue #2401 \u00b7 netblue30/firejail \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
