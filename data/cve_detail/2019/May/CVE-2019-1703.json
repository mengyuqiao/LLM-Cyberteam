{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1703", "Description": "A vulnerability in the internal packet-processing functionality of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for the Cisco Firepower 2100 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error, which may prevent ingress buffers from being replenished under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume all input buffers, which are shared between all interfaces, leading to a queue wedge condition in all active interfaces. This situation would cause an affected device to stop processing any incoming traffic and result in a DoS condition until the device is reloaded manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1703", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  from including (>=) 6.2.1andbefore (<) 6.2.3.12cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 2110\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 2120\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 2130\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbFirepower 2140\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-frpwr-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software Packet Processing Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108170", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software CVE-2019-1703 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
