{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12279", "Description": "Nagios XI 5.6.1 allows SQL injection via the username parameter to login.php?forgotpass (aka the reset password form). NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because the issue does not seem to be a legitimate SQL Injection. The POC does not show any valid injection that can be done with the variable provided, and while the username value being passed does get used in a SQL query, it is passed through SQL escaping functions when creating the call. The vendor tried re-creating the issue with no luck", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12279", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nNagios\u00bbNagios Xi\u00bbVersion:5.6.1cpe:2.3:a:nagios:nagios_xi:5.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.77% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.38%  0.77%  -0.61 \n 2  2024-05-15  1.37%  1.38%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-12  1.44%  1.37%  -0.08 \n 4  2023-10-03  1.02%  1.44%  +0.42 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.56%  1.02%  -0.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/JameelNabbo/exploits/blob/master/nagiosxi%20username%20sql%20injection.txt", "ref_desc": "exploits/nagiosxi username sql injection.txt at master \u00b7 JameelNabbo/exploits \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153040/Nagios-XI-5.6.1-SQL-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Nagios XI 5.6.1 SQL Injection \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108446", "ref_desc": "Nagios XI '/nagiosxi/login.php' SQL Injection Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
