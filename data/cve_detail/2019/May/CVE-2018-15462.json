{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15462", "Description": "A vulnerability in the TCP ingress handler for the data interfaces that are configured with management access to Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an increase in CPU and memory usage, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient ingress TCP rate limiting for TCP ports 22 (SSH) and 443 (HTTPS). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, steady stream of TCP traffic to port 22 or 443 on the data interfaces that are configured with management access to the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15462", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  before (<) 6.2.3.12cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  from including (>=) 6.3.0andbefore (<) 6.3.0.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.18%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-firepower-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software TCP Ingress Handler Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108178", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software CVE-2018-15462 Denial of Service Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
