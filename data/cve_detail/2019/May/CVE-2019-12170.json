{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12170", "Description": "ATutor through 2.2.4 is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads via the mods/_core/backups/upload.php (aka backup) component. This may result in remote command execution. An attacker can use the instructor account to fully compromise the system using a crafted backup ZIP archive. This will allow for PHP files to be written to the web root, and for code to execute on the remote server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12170", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAtutor\u00bbAtutorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.4cpe:2.3:a:atutor:atutor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.59%  2.93%  +1.34 \n 2  2024-10-07  1.32%  1.59%  +0.26 \n 3  2024-05-10  1.10%  1.32%  +0.22 \n 4  2023-03-07  44.86%  1.10%  -43.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://incidentsecurity.com/atutor-2-2-4-backup-remote-command-execution/", "ref_desc": "ATutor 2.2.4 'Backup' Remote Command Execution (CVE-2019-12170) \u00bb Incident SecurityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153869/ATutor-2.2.4-Backup-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "ATutor 2.2.4 Backup Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fuzzlove/ATutor-Instructor-Backup-Arbitrary-File", "ref_desc": "GitHub - fuzzlove/ATutor-Instructor-Backup-Arbitrary-File: ATutor 2.2.4 'Backup' Remote Command Execution (CVE-2019-12170)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
