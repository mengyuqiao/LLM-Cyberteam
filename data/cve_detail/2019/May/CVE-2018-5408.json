{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5408", "Description": "The PrinterLogic Print Management software, versions up to and including 18.3.1.96, does not validate, or incorrectly validates, the PrinterLogic management portal's SSL certificate. When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The software might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the software might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5408", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPrinterlogic\u00bbPrint ManagementVersions  up to, including, (<=) 18.3.1.96cpe:2.3:a:printerlogic:print_management:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/169249/", "ref_desc": "VU#169249 - PrinterLogic Print Management Software fails to validate SSL certificates or the integrity of software updates.US Government Resource;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_7Pn03yVaZsMu5k-l4wtKJ8hvW0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108285", "ref_desc": "PrinterLogic Print Management Software Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ys_W3xJNULJ2a7sVBlULOB4X3XA.html"}]}
