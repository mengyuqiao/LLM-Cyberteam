{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1862", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (Web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with root privileges. The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input parameter on a form in the Web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges, which may lead to complete system compromise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1862", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.3.7cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.3.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-06  0.30%  0.35%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.30%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108331", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software CVE-2019-1862 Command Injection Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/400865", "ref_desc": "VU#400865 - Cisco Trust Anchor module (TAm) improperly checks code and Cisco IOS XE web UI does not sanitize user inputCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kCEfbuCj7SemAuv7HePXX2C0TGc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190513-webui", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
