{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5626", "Description": "The Android mobile application BlueCats Reveal before 3.0.19 stores the username and password in a clear text file. This file persists until the user logs out or the session times out from non-usage (30 days of no user activity). This can allow an attacker to compromise the affected BlueCats network implementation. The attacker would first need to gain physical control of the Android device or compromise it with a malicious app.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5626", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBluecats\u00bbBluecats Reveal\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 3.0.19cpe:2.3:a:bluecats:bluecats_reveal:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-922 Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/922/Insecure-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluecats.bcreveal", "ref_desc": "BlueCats Reveal - Apps on Google PlayProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.rapid7.com/2019/05/21/investigating-the-plumbing-of-the-iot-ecosystem-r7-2018-65-r7-2019-07-fixed/", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities Disclosed for Eaton and BlueCats IoT DevicesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9q7fkg211QM69YDDtyBYgWD-5rk.html"}]}
