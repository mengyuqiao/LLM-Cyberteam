{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1823", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute code with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability exist because the software improperly validates user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file to the administrative web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1823", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.4.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEvolved Programmable Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:evolved_programmable_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbNetwork Level Service\u00bbVersion:3.0(0.0.83b)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:network_level_service:3.0\\(0.0.83b\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.04%  0.35%  -0.70 \n 2  2024-10-27  0.86%  1.04%  +0.18 \n 3  2024-07-19  0.87%  0.86%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-05-08  0.86%  0.87%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-24  0.61%  0.86%  +0.25 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.61%  -1.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108339", "ref_desc": "Multiple Cisco Products Multiple Remote Code Execution VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8Mgsw40Ovru49kKUlWoc63s0rmc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-pi-rce", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Evolved Programmable Network Manager Remote Code Execution VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JU1HdE4PiRhma21lkP5pS33CtAA.html"}]}
