{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12455", "Description": "An issue was discovered in sunxi_divs_clk_setup in drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrndup of derived_name, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because \u201cThe memory allocation that was not checked is part of a code that only runs at boot time, before user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it, and no denial of service.\u201d", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12455", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.1.5cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-23  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J36BIJTKEPUOZKJNHQBUZA47RQONUKOI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 30 Update: kernel-headers-5.1.7-300.fc30 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5nUnD274L2SE6-0TkPLfhS1tHJk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg2010240.html", "ref_desc": "Re: [PATCH] clk-sunxi: fix a missing-check bug in sunxi_divs_clk_setup()Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel%40vger.kernel.org/msg2010240.html", "ref_desc": "Re: [PATCH] clk-sunxi: fix a missing-check bug in sunxi_divs_clk_setup()", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J36BIJTKEPUOZKJNHQBUZA47RQONUKOI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 30 Update: kernel-headers-5.1.7-300.fc30 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kzpmxssVjLkjeWw2t-PmCzejxg0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sunxi/linux.git/commit/?h=sunxi/clk-for-5.3&id=fcdf445ff42f036d22178b49cf64e92d527c1330", "ref_desc": "kernel/git/sunxi/linux.git - Allwinner/Sunxi group's fork of linux.gitMailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190710-0002/", "ref_desc": "June 2019 Linux Kernel Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Wi-EQKHVhUEMvBdVF0qoTgj5Acw.html"}]}
