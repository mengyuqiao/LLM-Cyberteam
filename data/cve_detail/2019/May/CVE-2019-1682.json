{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1682", "Description": "A vulnerability in the FUSE filesystem functionality for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges to root on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for certain command strings issued on the CLI of the affected device. An attacker with write permissions for files within a readable folder on the device could alter certain definitions in the affected file. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the underlying FUSE driver to execute said crafted commands, elevating the attacker's privileges to root on an affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1682", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbApplication Policy Infrastructure ControllerVersions  before (<) 4.1\\(1i\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_policy_infrastructure_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-apic-priv-escalation", "ref_desc": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
