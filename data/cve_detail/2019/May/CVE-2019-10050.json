{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10050", "Description": "A buffer over-read issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.x before 4.1.4. If the input of the decode-mpls.c function DecodeMPLS is composed only of a packet of source address and destination address plus the correct type field and the right number for shim, an attacker can manipulate the control flow, such that the condition to leave the loop is true. After leaving the loop, the network packet has a length of 2 bytes. There is no validation of this length. Later on, the code tries to read at an empty position, leading to a crash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10050", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOisf\u00bbSuricataVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.1.4cpe:2.3:a:oisf:suricata:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://suricata-ids.org/2019/04/30/suricata-4-1-4-released/", "ref_desc": "Suricata 4.1.4 released | SuricataPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/d-v_7FfCdwNu7TLMTWC7kcV9TuU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.openinfosecfoundation.org/pipermail/oisf-announce/", "ref_desc": "The Oisf-announce ArchivesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iwnd63aO71GyTbQAHiTVowT9E1M.html"}]}
