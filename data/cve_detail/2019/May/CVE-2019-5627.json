{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5627", "Description": "The iOS mobile application BlueCats Reveal before 5.14 stores the username and password in the app cache as base64 encoded strings, i.e. clear text. These persist in the cache even if the user logs out. This can allow an attacker to compromise the affected BlueCats network implementation. The attacker would first need to gain physical control of the iOS device or compromise it with a malicious app.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5627", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBluecats\u00bbBc Reveal\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 5.14cpe:2.3:a:bluecats:bc_reveal:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-922 Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/922/Insecure-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.rapid7.com/2019/05/21/investigating-the-plumbing-of-the-iot-ecosystem-r7-2018-65-r7-2019-07-fixed/", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities Disclosed for Eaton and BlueCats IoT DevicesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9q7fkg211QM69YDDtyBYgWD-5rk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bc-reveal/id852676494", "ref_desc": "\u200eBC Reveal on the App\u00a0StoreProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
