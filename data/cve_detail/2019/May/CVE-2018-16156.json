{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-16156", "Description": "In PaperStream IP (TWAIN) 1.42.0.5685 (Service Update 7), the FJTWSVIC service running with SYSTEM privilege processes unauthenticated messages received over the FjtwMkic_Fjicube_32 named pipe. One of these message processing functions attempts to dynamically load the UninOldIS.dll library and executes an exported function named ChangeUninstallString. The default install does not contain this library and therefore if any DLL with that name exists in any directory listed in the PATH variable, it can be used to escalate to SYSTEM level privilege.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16156", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nFujitsu\u00bbPaperstream Ip (twain)\u00bbVersion:1.42.0.5685cpe:2.3:a:fujitsu:paperstream_ip_\\(twain\\):1.42.0.5685:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-04-07  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  3.25%  0.08%  -3.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.securifera.com/advisories/cve-2018-16156/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2018-16156 \u2013 SecuriferaThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160832/PaperStream-IP-TWAIN-1.42.0.5685-Local-Privilege-Escalation.html", "ref_desc": "PaperStream IP (TWAIN) 1.42.0.5685 Local Privilege Escalation \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
