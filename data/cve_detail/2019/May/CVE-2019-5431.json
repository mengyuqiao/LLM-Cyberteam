{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5431", "Description": "This vulnerability was caused by an incomplete fix to CVE-2017-0911. Twitter Kit for iOS versions 3.0 to 3.4.0 is vulnerable to a callback verification flaw in the \"Login with Twitter\" component allowing an attacker to provide alternate credentials. In the final step of \"Login with Twitter\" authentication information is passed back to the application using the registered custom URL scheme (typically twitterkit-<consumer-key>) on iOS. Because the callback handler did not verify the authenticity of the response, this step is vulnerable to forgery, potentially allowing attacker to associate a Twitter account with a third-party service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5431", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nTwitter\u00bbTwitter Kit\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  from including (>=) 3.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.4.0cpe:2.3:a:twitter:twitter_kit:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2018/vulnerability-in-twitter-kit-for-ios.html", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in Twitter Kit for iOSVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RWnl4th_6gVHQlDxJ8dP68DpoNA.html"}]}
