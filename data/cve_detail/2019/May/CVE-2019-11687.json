{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11687", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the DICOM Part 10 File Format in the NEMA DICOM Standard 1995 through 2019b. The preamble of a DICOM file that complies with this specification can contain the header for an executable file, such as Portable Executable (PE) malware. This space is left unspecified so that dual-purpose files can be created. (For example, dual-purpose TIFF/DICOM files are used in digital whole slide imaging for applications in medicine.) To exploit this vulnerability, someone must execute a maliciously crafted file that is encoded in the DICOM Part 10 File Format. PE/DICOM files are executable even with the .dcm file extension. Anti-malware configurations at healthcare facilities often ignore medical imagery. Also, anti-malware tools and business processes could violate regulatory frameworks (such as HIPAA) when processing suspicious DICOM files.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11687", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nNema\u00bbDicom StandardVersions  from including (>=) 1995andup to, including, (<=) 2019bcpe:2.3:a:nema:dicom_standard:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.20%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-04-25  0.16%  0.23%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.18%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.79%  0.18%  -1.61 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/d00rt/pedicom", "ref_desc": "GitHub - d00rt/pedicom: Documentation and proofs of concept on the polyglot file PEDICOM (PE executable + DICOM)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/d00rt/pedicom/blob/master/doc/Attacking_Digital_Imaging_and_Communication_in_Medicine_(DICOM)_file_format_standard_-_Markel_Picado_Ortiz_(d00rt).pdf", "ref_desc": "pedicom/Attacking_Digital_Imaging_and_Communication_in_Medicine_(DICOM)_file_format_standard_-_Markel_Picado_Ortiz_(d00rt).pdf at master \u00b7 d00rt/pedicom \u00b7 GitHubTechnical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://labs.cylera.com/2019.04.16/pe-dicom-medical-malware", "ref_desc": "HIPAA-Protected Malware?
