{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11808", "Description": "Ratpack versions before 1.6.1 generate a session ID using a cryptographically weak PRNG in the JDK's ThreadLocalRandom. This means that if an attacker can determine a small window for the server start time and obtain a session ID value, they can theoretically determine the sequence of session IDs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11808", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRatpack Project\u00bbRatpackVersions  before (<) 1.6.1cpe:2.3:a:ratpack_project:ratpack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-09-27  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-04-30  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-11  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/releases/tag/v1.6.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.6.1 \u00b7 ratpack/ratpack \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/issues/1448", "ref_desc": "Use UUID directly for generating session IDs \u00b7 Issue #1448 \u00b7 ratpack/ratpack \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/commit/f2b63eb82dd71194319fd3945f5edf29b8f3a42d", "ref_desc": "Use UUID directly for generating session IDs \u00b7 ratpack/ratpack@f2b63eb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
