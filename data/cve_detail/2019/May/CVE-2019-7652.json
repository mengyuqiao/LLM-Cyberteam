{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7652", "Description": "TheHive Project UnshortenLink analyzer before 1.1, included in Cortex-Analyzers before 1.15.2, has SSRF. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must create a new analysis, select URL for Data Type, and provide an SSRF payload like \"http://127.0.0.1:22\" in the Data parameter. The result can be seen in the main dashboard. Thus, it is possible to do port scans on localhost and intranet hosts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7652", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nThehive-project\u00bbCortex-analyzersVersions  before (<) 1.15.2cpe:2.3:a:thehive-project:cortex-analyzers:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.60%  0.56%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-06-25  0.64%  0.60%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-01-04  0.55%  0.64%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-03-07  7.31%  0.55%  -6.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.thehive-project.org/2019/02/11/unshortenlink-ssrf-and-cortex-analyzers-1-15-2/", "ref_desc": "UnshortenLink, SSRF and Cortex-Analyzers 1.15.2 \u2013 TheHive ProjectRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152804/TheHive-Project-Cortex-2.1.3-Server-Side-Request-Forgery.html", "ref_desc": "TheHive Project Cortex 2.1.3 Server Side Request Forgery \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
