{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9847", "Description": "A vulnerability in LibreOffice hyperlink processing allows an attacker to construct documents containing hyperlinks pointing to the location of an executable on the target users file system. If the hyperlink is activated by the victim the executable target is unconditionally launched. Under Windows and macOS when processing a hyperlink target explicitly activated by the user there was no judgment made on whether the target was an executable file, so such executable targets were launched unconditionally. This issue affects: All LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions prior to 6.1.6; LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions in the 6.2 series prior to 6.2.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9847", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nLibreoffice\u00bbLibreofficeVersions  from including (>=) 6.2andbefore (<) 6.2.3cpe:2.3:a:libreoffice:libreoffice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nLibreoffice\u00bbLibreofficeVersions  before (<) 6.1.6cpe:2.3:a:libreoffice:libreoffice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/cve-2019-9847/", "ref_desc": "502 Bad GatewayVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
