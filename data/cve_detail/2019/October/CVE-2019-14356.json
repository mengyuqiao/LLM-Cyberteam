{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14356", "Description": "On Coldcard MK1 and MK2 devices, a side channel for the row-based OLED display was found. The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels, allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example, a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover confidential secrets such as the PIN and BIP39 mnemonic. In other words, the side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device's USB connection to make power-consumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances, such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data.

NOTE: At Coinkite, we\u2019ve already mitigated it, even though we feel strongly that it is not a legitimate issue. In our opinion, it is both unproven (might not even work) and also completely impractical\u2014even if it could be made to work perfectly", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14356", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCoinkite\u00bbColdcard Mk1 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:o:coinkite:coldcard_mk1_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Coinkite\u00bbColdcard Mk1\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCoinkite\u00bbColdcard Mk2 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:o:coinkite:coldcard_mk2_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Coinkite\u00bbColdcard Mk2\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/someone42/hardware-bitcoin-wallet/blob/master/pic32/ssd1306.c", "ref_desc": "hardware-bitcoin-wallet/ssd1306.c at master \u00b7 someone42/hardware-bitcoin-wallet \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.coinkite.com/noise-troll/", "ref_desc": "Possible Information Leak, Considered Unlikely | COINKITE BlogPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
