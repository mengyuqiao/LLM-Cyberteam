{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14931", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Mitsubishi Electric Europe B.V. ME-RTU devices through 2.02 and INEA ME-RTU devices through 3.0. An unauthenticated remote OS Command Injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the RTU due to the passing of unsafe user supplied data to the RTU's system shell. Functionality in mobile.php provides users with the ability to ping sites or IP addresses via Mobile Connection Test. When the Mobile Connection Test is submitted, action.php is called to execute the test. An attacker can use a shell command separator (;) in the host variable to execute operating system commands upon submitting the test data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14931", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMitsubishielectric\u00bbSmartrtu FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.02cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:smartrtu_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mitsubishielectric\u00bbSmartrtu\u00bbVersion:N/A\nInea\u00bbMe-rtu FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.0cpe:2.3:o:inea:me-rtu_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Inea\u00bbMe-rtu\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "6.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.14%  6.22%  +5.09 \n 2  2024-09-18  1.16%  1.14%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-06-24  1.13%  1.16%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-06-12  1.18%  1.13%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-06-11  1.03%  1.18%  +0.14 \n 6  2023-04-19  0.81%  1.03%  +0.23 \n 7  2023-03-17  0.78%  0.81%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  8.38%  0.78%  -7.61 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.mogozobo.com/?p=3593", "ref_desc": "Mogozobo \u00bb (CVE-2019-14925 \u2013> CVE-2019-14931) Mitsubishi Electric & INEA RTU Multiple VulnerabilitiesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HkfDtUsBglhr7sVS-Xm-PAJwdfA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mogozobo.com/", "ref_desc": "MogozoboThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KJ68k69z-QLOYzkFGtMEG0yLvSw.html"}]}
