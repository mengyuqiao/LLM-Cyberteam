{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15894", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Espressif ESP-IDF 2.x, 3.0.x through 3.0.9, 3.1.x through 3.1.6, 3.2.x through 3.2.3, and 3.3.x through 3.3.1. An attacker who uses fault injection to physically disrupt the ESP32 CPU can bypass the Secure Boot digest verification at startup, and boot unverified code from flash. The fault injection attack does not disable the Flash Encryption feature, so if the ESP32 is configured with the recommended combination of Secure Boot and Flash Encryption, then the impact is minimized. If the ESP32 is configured without Flash Encryption then successful fault injection allows arbitrary code execution. To protect devices with Flash Encryption and Secure Boot enabled against this attack, a firmware change must be made to permanently enable Flash Encryption in the field if it is not already permanently enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15894", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEspressif\u00bbEsp-idfVersions  from including (>=) 3.0andbefore (<) 3.0.9cpe:2.3:a:espressif:esp-idf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEspressif\u00bbEsp-idfVersions  after (>) 3.2andbefore (<) 3.2.3cpe:2.3:a:espressif:esp-idf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEspressif\u00bbEsp-idfVersions  from including (>=) 3.3andbefore (<) 3.3.1cpe:2.3:a:espressif:esp-idf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEspressif\u00bbEsp-idfVersions  after (>) 3.1andbefore (<) 3.1.6cpe:2.3:a:espressif:esp-idf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-30  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-07-27  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-05-21  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-16  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.08%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_Security_Advisory_Concerning_Fault_Injection_and_Secure_Boot", "ref_desc": "Espressif Security Advisory Concerning Fault Injection and Secure Boot (CVE-2019-15894) | Espressif SystemsMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
