{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17575", "Description": "A file-rename filter bypass exists in admin/media/rename.php in WBCE CMS 1.4.0 and earlier. This can be exploited by an authenticated user with admin privileges to rename a media filename and extension. (For example: place PHP code in a .jpg file, and then change the file's base name to filename.ph and change the file's extension to p. Because of concatenation, the name is then treated as filename.php.) At the result, remote attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17575", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWbce\u00bbWbce CmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:wbce:wbce_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.37%  0.50%  +0.13 \n 2  2023-11-23  0.39%  0.37%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.39%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/706/Use-of-Incorrectly-Resolved-Name-or-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kbgsft/vuln-wbce/wiki/Arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerbility-in-WBCE-CMS-1.4.0", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary file upload vulnerbility in WBCE CMS 1.4.0 \u00b7 kbgsft/vuln-wbce Wiki \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
