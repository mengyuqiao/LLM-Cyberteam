{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14657", "Description": "Yealink phones through 2019-08-04 have an issue with OpenVPN file upload. They execute tar as root to extract files, but do not validate the extraction directory. Creating a tar file with ../../../../ allows replacement of almost any file on a phone. This leads to password replacement and arbitrary code execution as root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14657", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nYeahlink\u00bbVp59 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2019-08-04cpe:2.3:o:yeahlink:vp59_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Yeahlink\u00bbVp59\u00bbVersion:N/A\nYeahlink\u00bbT49g FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2019-08-04cpe:2.3:o:yeahlink:t49g_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Yeahlink\u00bbT49g\u00bbVersion:N/A\nYeahlink\u00bbT58v FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2019-08-04cpe:2.3:o:yeahlink:t58v_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Yeahlink\u00bbT58v\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.17%  -0.05 \n 2  2023-06-25  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-05-22  0.15%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.77%  0.15%  -1.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://cerebusforensics.com/yealink/exploit.html", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sMs-KmIYIiC-ToLtISo5Dle9-tM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sway.office.com/3pCb559LYVuT0eig", "ref_desc": "Exploiting Yealink IP phones on current firmware with two 0-day exploits.Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wdr2nt14M5SNVN7_cz-Cdx3a7jU.html"}]}
