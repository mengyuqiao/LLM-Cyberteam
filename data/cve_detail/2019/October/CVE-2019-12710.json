{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12710", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the confidentiality of an affected system by executing arbitrary SQL queries. The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly validates user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database, impacting the confidentiality of the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12710", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersion:10.5(2.10000.5)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:10.5\\(2.10000.5\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersion:11.5(1.10000.6)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:11.5\\(1.10000.6\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersion:12.0(1.10000.10)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:12.0\\(1.10000.10\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersion:12.5(1.10000.22)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:12.5\\(1.10000.22\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-22  0.21%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-06-19  0.16%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-cuc-inject", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager SQL Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
