{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15259", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by intercepting a user request on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks, web cache poisoning, access sensitive browser-based information, and similar exploits.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15259", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Contact Center ExpressVersions  before (<) 11.6\\(2\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Contact Center Express\u00bbVersion:12.0(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/113/Improper-Neutralization-of-CRLF-Sequences-in-HTTP-Headers-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-uccx-http", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Contact Center Express HTTP Response Splitting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
