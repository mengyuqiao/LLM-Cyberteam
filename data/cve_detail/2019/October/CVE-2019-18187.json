{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18187", "Description": "Trend Micro OfficeScan versions 11.0 and XG (12.0) could be exploited by an attacker utilizing a directory traversal vulnerability to extract files from an arbitrary zip file to a specific folder on the OfficeScan server, which could potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE). The remote process execution is bound to a web service account, which depending on the web platform used may have restricted permissions. An attempted attack requires user authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18187", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nTrendmicro\u00bbOfficescan\u00bbVersion:11.0UpdateSP1cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:officescan:11.0:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nTrendmicro\u00bbOfficescan\u00bbVersion:XGUpdateSP1cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:officescan:xg:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nTrendmicro\u00bbOfficescan\u00bbVersion:XGcpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:officescan:xg:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "11.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-07  8.65%  11.31%  +2.66 \n 2  2023-10-04  9.76%  8.65%  -1.11 \n 3  2023-08-17  9.53%  9.76%  +0.23 \n 4  2023-07-15  7.22%  9.53%  +2.32 \n 5  2023-06-11  6.51%  7.22%  +0.71 \n 6  2023-05-07  5.97%  6.51%  +0.53 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.16%  5.97%  +4.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/000151730", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
