{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18370", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Xiaomi Mi WiFi R3G devices before 2.28.23-stable. The backup file is in tar.gz format. After uploading, the application uses the tar zxf command to decompress, so one can control the contents of the files in the decompressed directory. In addition, the application's sh script for testing upload and download speeds reads a URL list from /tmp/speedtest_urls.xml, and there is a command injection vulnerability, as demonstrated by api/xqnetdetect/netspeed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18370", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMI\u00bbMillet Router 3g FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.28.23cpe:2.3:o:mi:millet_router_3g_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:MI\u00bbMillet Router 3g\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "14.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.80%  14.32%  +13.52 \n 2  2023-09-29  0.85%  0.80%  -0.05 \n 3  2023-06-22  1.19%  0.85%  -0.34 \n 4  2023-05-20  1.04%  1.19%  +0.15 \n 5  2023-04-14  1.47%  1.04%  -0.43 \n 6  2023-03-07  9.03%  1.47%  -7.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/UltramanGaia/Xiaomi_Mi_WiFi_R3G_Vulnerability_POC/blob/master/remote_command_execution_vulnerability.py", "ref_desc": "Xiaomi_Mi_WiFi_R3G_Vulnerability_POC/remote_command_execution_vulnerability.py at master \u00b7 UltramanGaia/Xiaomi_Mi_WiFi_R3G_Vulnerability_POC \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
