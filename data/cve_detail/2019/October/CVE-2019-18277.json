{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18277", "Description": "A flaw was found in HAProxy before 2.0.6. In legacy mode, messages featuring a transfer-encoding header missing the \"chunked\" value were not being correctly rejected. The impact was limited but if combined with the \"http-reuse always\" setting, it could be used to help construct an HTTP request smuggling attack against a vulnerable component employing a lenient parser that would ignore the content-length header as soon as it saw a transfer-encoding one (even if not entirely valid according to the specification).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18277", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHaproxy\u00bbHaproxyVersions  before (<) 2.0.6cpe:2.3:a:haproxy:haproxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.43% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.60%  1.43%  -0.17 \n 2  2024-10-16  1.30%  1.60%  +0.30 \n 3  2024-02-16  0.93%  1.30%  +0.37 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.70%  0.93%  +0.23 \n 5  2023-09-29  0.62%  0.70%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-09-13  0.45%  0.62%  +0.16 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.45%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy@formilux.org/msg34926.html", "ref_desc": "[ANNOUNCE] haproxy-2.0.6Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.haproxy.org/?p=haproxy-2.0.git;a=commit;h=196a7df44d8129d1adc795da020b722614d6a581", "ref_desc": "Repositories - haproxy-2.0.git/commitPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-12/msg00019.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2019:2645-1: important: Security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-12/msg00016.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2019:2626-1: important: Security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nathandavison.com/blog/haproxy-http-request-smuggling", "ref_desc": "HAProxy HTTP request smuggling - nathandavison.comExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00045.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3034-1] haproxy security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qHeT9vr0gYmKuGFw-x7z2zHtTc0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4174-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-4174-1: HAproxy vulnerability | Ubuntu security notices", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
