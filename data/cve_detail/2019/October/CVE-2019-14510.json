{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14510", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Kaseya VSA RMM through 9.5.0.22. When using the default configuration, the LAN Cache feature creates a local account FSAdminxxxxxxxxx (e.g., FSAdmin123456789) on the server that hosts the LAN Cache and all clients that are assigned to a LAN Cache. This account is placed into the local Administrators group of all clients assigned to the LAN Cache. When the assigned client is a Domain Controller, the FSAdminxxxxxxxxx account is created as a domain account and automatically added as a member of the domain BUILTIN\\Administrators group. Using the well known Pass-the-Hash techniques, an attacker can use the same FSAdminxxxxxxxxx hash from any LAN Cache client and pass this to a Domain Controller, providing administrative rights to the attacker on any Domain Controller. (Local account Pass-the-Hash mitigations do not protect domain accounts.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14510", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nKaseya\u00bbVSA\u00bb     RMMEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.5.0.22cpe:2.3:a:kaseya:vsa:*:*:*:*:rmm:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-04  0.11%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lockstepgroup.com/blog/cve-2019-14510-abusing-the-kaseya-lan-cache-fsadmin-red-team-edition/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-14510 - Abusing the Kaseya LAN Cache FSAdmin - Red Team Edition | Lockstep Technology GroupExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kaseya.com/products/vsa/", "ref_desc": "RMM Software - Remote Monitoring and Management | Kaseya VSAProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lockstepgroup.com/blog/abusing-the-kaseya-lan-cache-fsadmin/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-14510 - Abusing the Kaseya LAN Cache FSAdmin - Blue Team Edition | Lockstep Technology GroupExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://community.kaseya.com/xsp/f/355.aspx", "ref_desc": "Kaseya CommunityRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://community.kaseya.com/xsp/f/355/t/24675.aspx", "ref_desc": "Kaseya CommunityRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
