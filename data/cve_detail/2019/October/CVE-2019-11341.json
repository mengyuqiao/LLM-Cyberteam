{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11341", "Description": "On certain Samsung P(9.0) phones, an attacker with physical access can start a TCP Dump capture without the user's knowledge. This feature of the Service Mode application is available after entering the *#9900# check code, but is protected by an OTP password. However, this password is created locally and (due to mishandling of cryptography) can be obtained easily by reversing the password creation logic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11341", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:google:android:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbPhone\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-10-02  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-galaxy-secret-code-list.html", "ref_desc": "Most Complete Samsung Galaxy Secret Code List!Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb", "ref_desc": "Android Security Updates Details | Samsung Mobile SecurityNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BoNpdonMkbWVs4KPc12SO13___o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/fs0c131y/status/1115889065285562368", "ref_desc": "Elliot Alderson on Twitter: \"THREAD: If you have a @SamsungMobile phones, whatever your phone model, an attacker with a physical access to your phone can capture your network traffic without your consExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
