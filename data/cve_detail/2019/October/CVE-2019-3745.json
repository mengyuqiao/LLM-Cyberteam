{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3745", "Description": "The vulnerability is limited to the installers of Dell Encryption Enterprise versions prior to 10.4.0 and Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise versions prior to 2.4.0. This issue is exploitable only during the installation of the product by an administrator. A local authenticated low privileged user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by staging a malicious DLL in the search path of the installer prior to its execution by a local administrator. This would cause loading of the malicious DLL, which would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an administrator.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3745", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbEncryption\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 10.4.0cpe:2.3:a:dell:encryption:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nDell\u00bbEndpoint Security Suite EnterpriseVersions  before (<) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:dell:endpoint_security_suite_enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN318889", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
