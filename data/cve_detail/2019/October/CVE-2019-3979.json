{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3979", "Description": "RouterOS versions 6.45.6 Stable, 6.44.5 Long-term, and below are vulnerable to a DNS unrelated data attack. The router adds all A records to its DNS cache even when the records are unrelated to the domain that was queried. Therefore, a remote attacker controlled DNS server can poison the router's DNS cache via malicious responses with additional and untrue records.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3979", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMikrotik\u00bbRouteros\u00bbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.45.6cpe:2.3:o:mikrotik:routeros:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nMikrotik\u00bbRouteros\u00bb     LTREditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.44.5cpe:2.3:o:mikrotik:routeros:*:*:*:*:ltr:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.13%  -0.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.18%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-46", "ref_desc": "MikroTik RouterOS Multiple Vulnerabilities - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CoIX2Qb-k_VUBtSa0Xjyjgi17cM.html"}]}
