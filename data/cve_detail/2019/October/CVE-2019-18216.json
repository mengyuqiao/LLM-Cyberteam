{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18216", "Description": "The BIOS configuration design on ASUS ROG Zephyrus M GM501GS laptops with BIOS 313 relies on the main battery instead of using a CMOS battery, which reduces the value of a protection mechanism in which booting from a USB device is prohibited. Attackers who have physical laptop access can exhaust the main battery to reset the BIOS configuration, and then achieve direct access to the hard drive by booting a live USB OS without disassembling the laptop. NOTE: the vendor has apparently indicated that this is \"normal\" and use of the same battery for the BIOS and the overall system is a \"new design.\" However, the vendor apparently plans to \"improve\" this an unspecified later time", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18216", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAsus\u00bbRog Zephyrus M Gm501gs Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:asus:rog_zephyrus_m_gm501gs_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Asus\u00bbRog Zephyrus M Gm501gs\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.modpr0.be/2019/10/18/asus-rog-bios-reset-on-lost-battery-power/", "ref_desc": "ASUS ROG BIOS Reset on Lost Battery Power \u2013 Blog Teknis modpr0beThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
