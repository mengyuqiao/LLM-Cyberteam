{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10743", "Description": "All versions of archiver allow attacker to perform a Zip Slip attack via the \"unarchive\" functions. It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a \"../../file.exe\" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10743", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nArchiver Project\u00bbArchiverVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.3.2cpe:2.3:a:archiver_project:archiver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-02  0.16%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.56%  0.16%  -1.40 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability", "ref_desc": "Zip Slip Vulnerability | SnykThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FKSOntCymZw_Rje_Zo1CF4g0h8I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMMHOLTARCHIVERCMDARC-174728%2C", "ref_desc": "Page not found | SnykBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mholt/archiver/pull/169", "ref_desc": "Prevent arbitrary file overwrite via path traversal [CVE-2019-10743] by giuliocomi \u00b7 Pull Request #169 \u00b7 mholt/archiver \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMMHOLTARCHIVERCMDARC-174728", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip) in github.com/mholt/archiver/cmd/arc | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
