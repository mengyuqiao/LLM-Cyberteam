{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9534", "Description": "The Cobham EXPLORER 710, firmware version 1.07, does not validate its firmware image. Development scripts left in the firmware can be used to upload a custom firmware image that the device runs. This could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to upload their own firmware that could be used to intercept or modify traffic, spoof or intercept GPS traffic, exfiltrate private data, hide a backdoor, or cause a denial-of-service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9534", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCobham\u00bbExplorer 710 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.07cpe:2.3:o:cobham:explorer_710_firmware:1.07:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cobham\u00bbExplorer 710\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~  % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-494 Download of Code Without Integrity Check", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/494/Download-of-Code-Without-Integrity-Check.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/719689/", "ref_desc": "VU#719689 - Multiple vulnerabilities found in the Cobham EXPLORER 710 satcom terminalThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4xF8ZucBFgM9Y04WKJiGuIcFQkQ.html"}]}
