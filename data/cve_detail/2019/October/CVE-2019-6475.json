{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6475", "Description": "Mirror zones are a BIND feature allowing recursive servers to pre-cache zone data provided by other servers. A mirror zone is similar to a zone of type secondary, except that its data is subject to DNSSEC validation before being used in answers, as if it had been looked up via traditional recursion, and when mirror zone data cannot be validated, BIND falls back to using traditional recursion instead of the mirror zone. However, an error in the validity checks for the incoming zone data can allow an on-path attacker to replace zone data that was validated with a configured trust anchor with forged data of the attacker's choosing. The mirror zone feature is most often used to serve a local copy of the root zone. If an attacker was able to insert themselves into the network path between a recursive server using a mirror zone and a root name server, this vulnerability could then be used to cause the recursive server to accept a copy of falsified root zone data. This affects BIND versions 9.14.0 up to 9.14.6, and 9.15.0 up to 9.15.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6475", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nISC\u00bbBindVersions  from including (>=) 9.14.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.14.6cpe:2.3:a:isc:bind:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nISC\u00bbBindVersions  from including (>=) 9.15.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.15.4cpe:2.3:a:isc:bind:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.19%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-10-10  0.17%  0.24%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-08-21  0.13%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-08-06  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2019-6475", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-6475: A flaw in mirror zone validity checking can allow zone data to be spoofed - Security AdvisoriesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191024-0004/", "ref_desc": "October 2019 ISC BIND Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Le6PUSOPBIZk4Eg1v4UIWlo3GtQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K42238532?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS", "ref_desc": "Article: K42238532 - BIND vulnerabilities CVE-2019-6475 and CVE-2019-6476CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vPhTQNBZdTD9LcQH9RQcIXOXWS4.html"}]}
