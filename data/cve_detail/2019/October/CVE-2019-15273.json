{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15273", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient permission enforcement. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating as the remote support user and submitting malicious input to specific commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the underlying filesystem. The attacker has no control over the contents of the data written to the file. Overwriting a critical file could cause the device to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition (DoS).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15273", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Collaboration EndpointVersions  before (<) 9.8.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_collaboration_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-tele-ce-file-ovrwrt", "ref_desc": "Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint Software Arbitrary File Overwrite VulnerabilitiesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
