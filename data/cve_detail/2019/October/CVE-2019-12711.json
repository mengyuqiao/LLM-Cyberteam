{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12711", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (SME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper restrictions on XML entities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected system that contain references in XML entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the application to consume available resources, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12711", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersion:10.5(2.10000.5)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:10.5\\(2.10000.5\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersion:11.5(1.10000.6)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:11.5\\(1.10000.6\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersion:12.0(1.10000.10)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:12.0\\(1.10000.10\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersion:12.5(1.10000.22)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:12.5\\(1.10000.22\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-cucm-xxe", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager XML External Expansion VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
