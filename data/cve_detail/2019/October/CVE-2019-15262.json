{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15262", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) session management for Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the SSH process is not properly deleted when an SSH connection to the device is disconnected. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly opening SSH connections to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system resources by initiating multiple SSH connections to the device that are not effectively terminated, which could result in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15262", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bb5520 Wireless Lan Controller FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 8.5.140.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:5520_wireless_lan_controller_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb5520 Wireless Lan Controller\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bb5508 Wireless Lan Controller FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 8.5.140.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:5508_wireless_lan_controller_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb5508 Wireless Lan Controller\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-wlc-ssh-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Secure Shell Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
