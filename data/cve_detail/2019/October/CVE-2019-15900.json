{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15900", "Description": "An issue was discovered in slicer69 doas before 6.2 on certain platforms other than OpenBSD. On platforms without strtonum(3), sscanf was used without checking for error cases. Instead, the uninitialized variable errstr was checked and in some cases returned success even if sscanf failed. The result was that, instead of reporting that the supplied username or group name did not exist, it would execute the command as root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15900", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDoas Project\u00bbDoasVersions  before (<) 6.2cpe:2.3:a:doas_project:doas:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.23%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-02-17  0.24%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-252 Unchecked Return Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/252/Unchecked-Return-Value.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/908/Use-of-Uninitialized-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/slicer69/doas/commit/2f83222829448e5bc4c9391d607ec265a1e06531", "ref_desc": "Added optimization to Makefile (can be set/overruled using OPT). \u00b7 slicer69/doas@2f83222 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/slicer69/doas/compare/6.1p1...6.2", "ref_desc": "Comparing 6.1p1...6.2 \u00b7 slicer69/doas \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DFTKP-Dvahbpnk48w-129cCcqO8.html"}]}
