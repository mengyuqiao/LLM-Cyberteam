{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12941", "Description": "AutoPi Wi-Fi/NB and 4G/LTE devices before 2019-10-15 allows an attacker to perform a brute-force attack or dictionary attack to gain access to the WiFi network, which provides root access to the device. The default WiFi password and WiFi SSID are derived from the same hash function output (input is only 8 characters), which allows an attacker to deduce the WiFi password from the WiFi SSID.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12941", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAutopi\u00bbWi-fi/nb FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2019-10-15cpe:2.3:o:autopi:wi-fi\\/nb_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Autopi\u00bbWi-fi/nb\u00bbVersion:N/A\nAutopi\u00bb4g/lte FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2019-10-15cpe:2.3:o:autopi:4g\\/lte_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Autopi\u00bb4g/lte\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.78%  1.32%  +0.54 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.65%  0.78%  +0.13 \n 3  2023-11-08  1.06%  0.65%  -0.42 \n 4  2023-07-01  0.89%  1.06%  +0.17 \n 5  2023-05-28  0.73%  0.89%  +0.16 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.73%  -0.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kth.se/nse/research/software-systems-architecture-and-security/", "ref_desc": "Software Systems Architecture and Security | KTHThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.931922.1571071632!/Burdzovic_Matsson_dongle_v2.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1334244/FULLTEXT01.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
