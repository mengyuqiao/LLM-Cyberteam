{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5023", "Description": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the grsecurity PaX patch for the function read_kmem, in PaX from version pax-linux-4.9.8-test1 to 4.9.24-test7, grsecurity official from version grsecurity-3.1-4.9.8-201702060653 to grsecurity-3.1-4.9.24-201704252333, grsecurity unofficial from version v4.9.25-unofficialgrsec to v4.9.74-unofficialgrsec. PaX adds a temp buffer to the read_kmem function, which is never freed when an invalid address is supplied. This results in a memory leakage that can lead to a crash of the system. An attacker needs to induce a read to /dev/kmem using an invalid address to exploit this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5023", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpensrcsec\u00bbGrsecurity\u00bb     UnofficialEditionVersions  from including (>=) 4.9.25andup to, including, (<=) 4.9.74cpe:2.3:a:opensrcsec:grsecurity:*:*:*:*:unofficial:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensrcsec\u00bbGrsecurity\u00bb     OfficialEditionVersions  from including (>=) 3.1-4.9.8-201702060653andup to, including, (<=) 3.1-4.9.24-201704252333cpe:2.3:a:opensrcsec:grsecurity:*:*:*:*:official:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensrcsec\u00bbPAXVersions  from including (>=) pax-linux-4.9.8-test1andup to, including, (<=) pax-linux-4.9.8-test7cpe:2.3:a:opensrcsec:pax:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/772/Missing-Release-of-Resource-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2019-0784", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2019-0784 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
