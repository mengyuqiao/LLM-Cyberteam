{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15901", "Description": "An issue was discovered in slicer69 doas before 6.2 on certain platforms other than OpenBSD. A setusercontext(3) call with flags to change the UID, primary GID, and secondary GIDs was replaced (on certain platforms: Linux and possibly NetBSD) with a single setuid(2) call.
