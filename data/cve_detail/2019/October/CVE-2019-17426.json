{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17426", "Description": "Automattic Mongoose through 5.7.4 allows attackers to bypass access control (in some applications) because any query object with a _bsontype attribute is ignored. For example, adding \"_bsontype\":\"a\" can sometimes interfere with a query filter. NOTE: this CVE is about Mongoose's failure to work around this _bsontype special case that exists in older versions of the bson parser (aka the mongodb/js-bson project).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17426", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMongoosejs\u00bbMongoose\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.7.4cpe:2.3:a:mongoosejs:mongoose:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.13%  -0.07 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/commit/f3eca5b94d822225c04e96cbeed9f095afb3c31c", "ref_desc": "fix(query): delete top-level `_bsontype` property in queries to preve\u2026 \u00b7 Automattic/mongoose@f3eca5b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues/8222", "ref_desc": "Mongoose query condition abuse vulnerability. \u00b7 Issue #8222 \u00b7 Automattic/mongoose \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
