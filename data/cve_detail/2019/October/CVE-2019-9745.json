{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9745", "Description": "CloudCTI HIP Integrator Recognition Configuration Tool allows privilege escalation via its EXQUISE integration. This tool communicates with a service (Recognition Update Client Service) via an insecure communication channel (Named Pipe). The data (JSON) sent via this channel is used to import data from CRM software using plugins (.dll files). The plugin to import data from the EXQUISE software (DatasourceExquiseExporter.dll) can be persuaded to start arbitrary programs (including batch files) that are executed using the same privileges as Recognition Update Client Service (NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM), thus elevating privileges. This occurs because a higher-privileged process executes scripts from a directory writable by a lower-privileged user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9745", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCloudcti\u00bbHip Integrator Recognition Configuration Tool\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cloudcti:hip_integrator_recognition_configuration_tool:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.40%  0.05%  -1.35 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cloudcti.nl/Site/Security", "ref_desc": "CloudCTIVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KPN-CISO/CVE-2019-9745/blob/master/README.md", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-9745/README.md at master \u00b7 KPN-CISO/CVE-2019-9745 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
