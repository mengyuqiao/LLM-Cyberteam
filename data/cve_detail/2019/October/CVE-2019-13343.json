{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13343", "Description": "Butor Portal before 1.0.27 is affected by a Path Traversal vulnerability leading to a pre-authentication arbitrary file download. Effectively, a remote anonymous user can download any file on servers running Butor Portal. WhiteLabelingServlet is responsible for this vulnerability. It does not properly sanitize user input on the theme t parameter before reusing it in a path. This path is then used without validation to fetch a file and return its raw content to the user via the /wl?t=../../...&h= substring followed by a filename.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13343", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nButor\u00bbPortalVersions  before (<) 1.0.27cpe:2.3:a:butor:portal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.41%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.32%  0.39%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-06-19  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.28%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bitbucket.org/butor-team/portal/src/cd7055d33e194fcf530100ee1d8d13aa9cde230b/src/main/java/com/butor/portal/web/servlet/WhiteLabelingServlet.java?at=master", "ref_desc": "butor-team / portal / src / main / java / com / butor / portal / web / servlet / WhiteLabelingServlet.java \u2014 BitbucketExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bitbucket.org/account/user/butor-team/projects/PROJ", "ref_desc": "butor team / butor stack \u2014 BitbucketThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bitbucket.org/butor-team/portal/commits/cd7055d33e194fcf530100ee1d8d13aa9cde230b", "ref_desc": "butor-team / portal / commit / cd7055d33e19 \u2014 BitbucketPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gosecure.net/blog/2019/09/30/butor-portal-arbitrary-file-download-vulnerability-cve-2019-13343", "ref_desc": "Butor Portal Arbitrary File Download Vulnerability (CVE-2019-13343) | GoSecureExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bitbucket.org/butor-team/portal/commits/all", "ref_desc": "butor-team / portal \u2014 BitbucketThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
