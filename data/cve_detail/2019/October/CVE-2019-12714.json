{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12714", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly manages system resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a large number of simultaneous sessions on the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition of the web-based management interface, preventing normal management operations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12714", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIc3000 Industrial Compute Gateway FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ic3000_industrial_compute_gateway_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIc3000 Industrial Compute Gateway\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-ic3000-icg-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
