{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18466", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Podman in libpod before 1.6.0. It resolves a symlink in the host context during a copy operation from the container to the host, because an undesired glob operation occurs. An attacker could create a container image containing particular symlinks that, when copied by a victim user to the host filesystem, may overwrite existing files with others from the host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18466", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLibpod Project\u00bbLibpodVersions  before (<) 1.6.0cpe:2.3:a:libpod_project:libpod:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.13%  0.19%  +0.06 \n 2  2023-10-04  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.12%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/3829", "ref_desc": "podman cp dereferences symlink in host context after filepath.Glob(srcPath) \u00b7 Issue #3829 \u00b7 containers/libpod \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containers/libpod/commit/5c09c4d2947a759724f9d5aef6bac04317e03f7e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #3942 from jwhonce/issue/3829 \u00b7 containers/libpod@5c09c4d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1744588", "ref_desc": "1744588 \u2013 (CVE-2019-18466) CVE-2019-18466 podman: resolving symlink in host filesystem leads to unexpected results of copy operationIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containers/libpod/compare/v1.5.1...v1.6.0", "ref_desc": "Comparing v1.5.1...v1.6.0 \u00b7 containers/libpod \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4269", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:4269 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KkwQjaOywVKbv4p-97PzlQYb4KU.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-03/msg00040.html", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
