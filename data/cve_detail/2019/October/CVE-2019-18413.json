{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18413", "Description": "In TypeStack class-validator 0.10.2, validate() input validation can be bypassed because certain internal attributes can be overwritten via a conflicting name. Even though there is an optional forbidUnknownValues parameter that can be used to reduce the risk of this bypass, this option is not documented and thus most developers configure input validation in the vulnerable default manner. With this vulnerability, attackers can launch SQL Injection or XSS attacks by injecting arbitrary malicious input. NOTE: a software maintainer agrees with the \"is not documented\" finding but suggests that much of the responsibility for the risk lies in a different product.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18413", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection;Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTypestack Class-validator Project\u00bbTypestack Class-validator\u00bbVersion:0.10.2cpe:2.3:a:typestack_class-validator_project:typestack_class-validator:0.10.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-17  0.16%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-07-11  0.20%  0.16%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-06-07  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.13%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/typestack/class-validator/issues/438", "ref_desc": "class-validator arbitrary bypass vulnerability \u00b7 Issue #438 \u00b7 typestack/class-validator \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/typestack/class-validator/issues/1422#issuecomment-1344635415", "ref_desc": "security: SNYK-JS-CLASSVALIDATOR-1730566 \u00b7 Issue #1422 \u00b7 typestack/class-validator \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/typestack/class-validator#passing-options", "ref_desc": "GitHub - typestack/class-validator: Decorator-based property validation for classes.Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/typestack/class-validator/issues/438#issuecomment-964728471", "ref_desc": "documentation: default settings for class-validator allows arbitrary bypass vulnerability \u00b7 Issue #438 \u00b7 typestack/class-validator \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
