{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13020", "Description": "The fetch API in Tightrope Media Carousel before 7.1.3 has CarouselAPI/v0/fetch?url= SSRF. This has two potential areas for abuse. First, a specially crafted URL could be used in a phishing attack to hijack the trust the user and the browser have with the website and could serve malicious content from a third-party attacker-controlled system. Second, arguably more severe, is the potential for an attacker to circumvent firewall controls, by proxying traffic, unauthenticated, into the internal network from the internet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13020", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nTrms\u00bbTightrope Media CarouselVersions  before (<) 7.1.3cpe:2.3:a:trms:tightrope_media_carousel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.carouselsignage.com/release-notes/carousel-7-1-3", "ref_desc": "Carousel Digital Signage - Carousel 7.1.3Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
