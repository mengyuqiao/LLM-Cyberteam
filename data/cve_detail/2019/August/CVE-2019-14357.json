{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14357", "Description": "On Mooltipass Mini devices, a side channel for the row-based OLED display was found. The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels, allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example, a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover confidential secrets such as the PIN. In other words, the side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device's USB connection to make power-consumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances, such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data. NOTE: the vendor's position is that an attack is not \"realistically implementable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14357", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMooltipass\u00bbMooltipass Mini Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:mooltipass:mooltipass_mini_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Mooltipass\u00bbMooltipass Mini\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/limpkin/mooltipass/blob/master/CVE-2019-14357_statement.md", "ref_desc": "mooltipass/CVE-2019-14357_statement.md at master \u00b7 limpkin/mooltipass \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
