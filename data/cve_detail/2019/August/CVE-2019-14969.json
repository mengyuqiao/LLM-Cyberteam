{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14969", "Description": "Netwrix Auditor before 9.8 has insecure permissions on %PROGRAMDATA%\\Netwrix Auditor\\Logs\\ActiveDirectory\\ and sub-folders. In addition, the service Netwrix.ADA.StorageAuditService (which writes to that directory) does not perform proper impersonation, and thus the target file will have the same permissions as the invoking process (in this case, granting Authenticated Users full access over the target file). This vulnerability can be triggered by a low-privileged user to perform DLL Hijacking/Binary Planting attacks and ultimately execute code as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM with the help of Symbolic Links.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14969", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNetwrix\u00bbAuditorVersions  before (<) 9.8cpe:2.3:a:netwrix:auditor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/active-labs/Advisories/blob/master/2019/ACTIVE-2019-010.md", "ref_desc": "Advisories/ACTIVE-2019-010.md at master \u00b7 active-labs/Advisories \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
