{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14526", "Description": "An issue was discovered on NETGEAR Nighthawk M1 (MR1100) devices before 12.06.03. The web-interface Cross-Site Request Forgery token is stored in a dynamically generated JavaScript file, and therefore can be embedded in third party pages, and re-used against the Nighthawk web interface. This entirely bypasses the intended security benefits of the use of a CSRF-protection token.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14526", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNetgear\u00bbMr1100 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 12.06.03cpe:2.3:o:netgear:mr1100_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Netgear\u00bbMr1100\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.52%  +0.41 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/how-not-to-do-cross-site-request-forgery-protection-the-netgear-nighthawk-m1/", "ref_desc": "How Not To Do Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection \u2013 The Netgear Nighthawk M1 | Pen Test PartnersExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zn7BeKJKu6QjRJtOK3awOfHIaM4.html"}]}
