{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11396", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Avira Free Security Suite 10. The permissive access rights on the SoftwareUpdater folder (files / folders and configuration) are incompatible with the privileged file manipulation performed by the product. Files can be created that can be used by an unprivileged user to obtain SYSTEM privileges. Arbitrary file creation can be achieved by abusing the SwuConfig.json file creation: an unprivileged user can replace these files by pseudo-symbolic links to arbitrary files. When an update occurs, a privileged service creates a file and sets its access rights, offering write access to the Everyone group in any directory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11396", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAvira\u00bbFree Security Suite\u00bbVersion:2019cpe:2.3:a:avira:free_security_suite:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nAvira\u00bbSoftware UpdaterVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.6.13175cpe:2.3:a:avira:software_updater:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-22  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/1", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Avira Free Security Suite 2019 - Exploiting Arbitrary File Writes for Local Elevation of PrivilegeMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153868/Avira-Free-Security-Suite-2019-Software-Updater-2.0.6.13175-Improper-Access-Control.html", "ref_desc": "Avira Free Security Suite 2019 Software Updater 2.0.6.13175 Improper Access Control \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://medium.com/sidechannel-br/vulnerabilidade-no-avira-security-suite-pode-levar-%C3%A0-escala%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-privil%C3%A9gios-no-windows-71964236c077", "ref_desc": "Vulnerabilidade no Avira Security Suite pode levar \u00e0 escala\u00e7\u00e3o de privil\u00e9gios no Windows", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
