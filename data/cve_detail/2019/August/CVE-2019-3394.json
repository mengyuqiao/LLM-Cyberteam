{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3394", "Description": "There was a local file disclosure vulnerability in Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center via page exporting. An attacker with permission to editing a page is able to exploit this issue to read arbitrary file on the server under <install-directory>/confluence/WEB-INF directory, which may contain configuration files used for integrating with other services, which could potentially leak credentials or other sensitive information such as LDAP credentials. The LDAP credential will be potentially leaked only if the Confluence server is configured to use LDAP as user repository. All versions of Confluence Server from 6.1.0 before 6.6.16 (the fixed version for 6.6.x), from 6.7.0 before 6.13.7 (the fixed version for 6.13.x), and from 6.14.0 before 6.15.8 (the fixed version for 6.15.x) are affected by this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3394", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nAtlassian\u00bbConfluenceVersions  from including (>=) 6.1.0andbefore (<) 6.6.16cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:confluence:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbConfluenceVersions  from including (>=) 6.7.0andbefore (<) 6.13.7cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:confluence:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbConfluence ServerVersions  from including (>=) 6.14.0andbefore (<) 6.15.8cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:confluence_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "14.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-02  18.85%  14.24%  -4.61 \n 2  2023-03-07  10.86%  18.85%  +8.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/uAsvOg", "ref_desc": "Confluence Security Advisory - 2019-08-28 - Atlassian DocumentationPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-58734", "ref_desc": "[CONFSERVER-58734] Local File Disclosure via Word Export in Confluence Server - CVE-2019-3394 - Create and track feature requests for Atlassian products.Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
