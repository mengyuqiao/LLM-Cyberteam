{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1929", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1929", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings Server\u00bbVersion:2.8cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings_server:2.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings Server\u00bbVersion:3.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings_server:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings Server\u00bbVersion:3.0mr2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings_server:3.0mr2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings Server\u00bbVersion:4.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings_server:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Business SuiteVersions  before (<) 39.5.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_business_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings OnlineVersions  before (<) 1.3.43cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings_online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.07%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-webex-player", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wY8SkvVG-gWr9Rt69k81quZ3d_8.html"}]}
