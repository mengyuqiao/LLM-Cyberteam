{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1194", "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nIn a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1194", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbInternet Explorer\u00bbVersion:9cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2008\u00bbVersion:N/AUpdateSP2\nMicrosoft\u00bbInternet Explorer\u00bbVersion:10cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2012\u00bbVersion:N/A\nMicrosoft\u00bbInternet Explorer\u00bbVersion:11cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:11:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1607When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1703When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1709When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1803When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1809When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1903When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 7\u00bbVersion:N/AUpdateSP1When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 8.1\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Rt 8.1\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2008\u00bbVersion:R2UpdateSP1ForX64When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2012\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2012\u00bbVersion:R2When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2016\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2019\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "5.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.22%  5.97%  +2.75 \n 2  2024-11-22  2.86%  3.22%  +0.36 \n 3  2024-07-04  2.13%  2.86%  +0.73 \n 4  2023-12-26  1.74%  2.13%  +0.39 \n 5  2023-08-21  2.05%  1.74%  -0.30 \n 6  2023-07-21  2.75%  2.05%  -0.70 \n 7  2023-05-16  1.60%  2.75%  +1.15 \n 8  2023-05-01  1.11%  1.60%  +0.48 \n 9  2023-04-13  1.05%  1.11%  +0.07 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.87%  1.05%  -1.82 \n 11  2023-02-08  2.22%  2.87%  +0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1194", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-1194 | Scripting Engine Memory Corruption VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
