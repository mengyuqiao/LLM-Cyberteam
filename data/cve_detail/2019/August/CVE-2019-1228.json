{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1228", "Description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user\u2019s system.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1228", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows Server 2008\u00bbVersion:N/AUpdateSP2cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:-:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows Server 2008\u00bbVersion:R2UpdateSP1ForItaniumcpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:sp1:*:*:*:*:itanium:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows Server 2008\u00bbVersion:R2UpdateSP1ForX64cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:sp1:*:*:*:*:x64:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows 7\u00bbVersion:N/AUpdateSP1cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:-:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-04-10  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.38%  0.05%  -1.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1228", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-1228 - Security Update Guide - Microsoft - Windows Kernel Information Disclosure VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
