{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1955", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured user filters on the device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input and validation checking mechanisms for certain SPF messages that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a customized SPF packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the header filters that are configured for the affected device, which could allow malicious content to pass through the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1955", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.0mr1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance Firmware\u00bbVersion:12.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-08  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.14%  0.11%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-esm-inject", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance Header Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
