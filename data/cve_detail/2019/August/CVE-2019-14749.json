{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14749", "Description": "An issue was discovered in osTicket before 1.10.7 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1. CSV (aka Formula) injection exists in the export spreadsheets functionality. These spreadsheets are generated dynamically from unvalidated or unfiltered user input in the Name and Internal Notes fields in the Users tab, and the Issue Summary field in the tickets tab. This allows other agents to download data in a .csv file format or .xls file format. This is used as input for spreadsheet applications such as Excel and OpenOffice Calc, resulting in a situation where cells in the spreadsheets can contain input from an untrusted source. As a result, the end user who is accessing the exported spreadsheet can be affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14749", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOsticket\u00bbOsticketVersions  before (<) 1.10.7cpe:2.3:a:osticket:osticket:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOsticket\u00bbOsticketVersions  from including (>=) 1.12andbefore (<) 1.12.1cpe:2.3:a:osticket:osticket:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.53%  3.29%  -1.24 \n 2  2024-11-15  4.83%  4.53%  -0.29 \n 3  2024-10-29  4.84%  4.83%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-09-23  5.70%  4.84%  -0.85 \n 5  2024-09-04  4.76%  5.70%  +0.94 \n 6  2024-08-18  6.58%  4.76%  -1.82 \n 7  2024-07-31  5.69%  6.58%  +0.89 \n 8  2024-06-12  6.56%  5.69%  -0.87 \n 9  2024-05-27  7.08%  6.56%  -0.52 \n 10  2024-05-07  6.32%  7.08%  +0.75 \n 11  2024-04-03  5.54%  6.32%  +0.79 \n 12  2024-03-22  6.67%  5.54%  -1.13 \n 13  2024-02-18  5.36%  6.67%  +1.31 \n 14  2023-06-11  6.22%  5.36%  -0.86 \n 15  2023-05-27  5.70%  6.22%  +0.53 \n 16  2023-03-07  8.94%  5.70%  -3.25 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1236 Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1236/Improper-Neutralization-of-Formula-Elements-in-a-CSV-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154004/osTicket-1.12-Formula-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "osTicket 1.12 Formula Injection \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/releases/tag/v1.12.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.12.1 \u00b7 osTicket/osTicket \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AP0oNRYQGBCAql5jtM-VYD5FBO8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/commit/99818486c5b1d8aa445cee232825418d6834f249", "ref_desc": "security: CSV Formula Injection \u00b7 osTicket/osTicket@9981848 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47225", "ref_desc": "osTicket 1.12 - Formula InjectionThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/releases/tag/v1.10.7", "ref_desc": "Release v1.10.7 \u00b7 osTicket/osTicket \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oLF-XyMmdL40n3f4Zy7BCTx-SPI.html"}]}
