{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15506", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Kaseya Virtual System Administrator (VSA) through 9.4.0.37. It has a critical information disclosure vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can send properly formatted requests to the web application and download sensitive files and information. For example, the /DATAREPORTS directory can be farmed for reports. Because this directory contains the results of reports such as NMAP, Patch Status, and Active Directory domain metadata, an attacker can easily collect this critical information and parse it for information. There are a number of directories affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15506", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nKaseya\u00bbVirtual System AdministratorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.4.0.37cpe:2.3:a:kaseya:virtual_system_administrator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.15%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://help.kaseya.com/WebHelp/EN/RN/index.asp#VSAReleaseNotes.htm", "ref_desc": "Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://dfdrconsulting.com/2019/cyber-security/cve-2019-15506-kaseya-vsa-critical-information-disclosure-unauthenticated-access/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-15506: Kaseya VSA \u2014 Critical Information Disclosure / Unauthenticated Access \u2013 DFDRThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
