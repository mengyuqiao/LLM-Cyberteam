{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14748", "Description": "An issue was discovered in osTicket before 1.10.7 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1. The Ticket creation form allows users to upload files along with queries. It was found that the file-upload functionality has fewer (or no) mitigations implemented for file content checks; also, the output is not handled properly, causing persistent XSS that leads to cookie stealing or malicious actions. For example, a non-agent user can upload a .html file, and Content-Disposition will be set to inline instead of attachment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14748", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOsticket\u00bbOsticketVersions  before (<) 1.10.7cpe:2.3:a:osticket:osticket:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOsticket\u00bbOsticketVersions  from including (>=) 1.12andbefore (<) 1.12.1cpe:2.3:a:osticket:osticket:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.38%  0.32%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-08-18  0.40%  0.38%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-07-31  0.41%  0.40%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-06-28  0.35%  0.41%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-03-22  0.39%  0.35%  -0.04 \n 6  2024-02-03  0.34%  0.39%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-10-02  0.35%  0.34%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-04-24  0.36%  0.35%  0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  2.19%  0.36%  -1.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/releases/tag/v1.12.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.12.1 \u00b7 osTicket/osTicket \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AP0oNRYQGBCAql5jtM-VYD5FBO8.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154003/osTicket-1.12-File-Upload-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "osTicket 1.12 File Upload Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47224", "ref_desc": "osTicket 1.12 - Persistent Cross-Site Scripting via File UploadExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/releases/tag/v1.10.7", "ref_desc": "Release v1.10.7 \u00b7 osTicket/osTicket \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oLF-XyMmdL40n3f4Zy7BCTx-SPI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/commit/33ed106b1602f559a660a69f931a9d873685d1ba", "ref_desc": "security: HTML File Browser Execution (Windows: Firefox/IE) \u00b7 osTicket/osTicket@33ed106 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
