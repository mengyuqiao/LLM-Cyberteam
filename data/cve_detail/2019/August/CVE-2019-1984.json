{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1984", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrator privileges to overwrite files on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in an NFVIS file-system command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted variables during the execution of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the underlying OS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1984", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure SofwareVersions  before (<) 3.12.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_network_function_virtualization_infrastructure_sofware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.11%  -1.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-nfv-filewrite", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure Software Arbitrary File Write VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
