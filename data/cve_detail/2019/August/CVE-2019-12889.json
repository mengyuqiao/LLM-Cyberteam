{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12889", "Description": "An unauthenticated privilege escalation exists in SailPoint Desktop Password Reset 7.2. A user with local access to only the Windows logon screen can escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\System. An attacker would need local access to the machine for a successful exploit. The attacker must disconnect the computer from the local network / WAN and connect it to an internet facing access point / network. At that point, the attacker can execute the password-reset functionality, which will expose a web browser. Browsing to a site that calls local Windows system functions (e.g., file upload) will expose the local file system. From there an attacker can launch a privileged command shell.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12889", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSailpoint\u00bbDesktop Password Reset\u00bbVersion:7.2cpe:2.3:a:sailpoint:desktop_password_reset:7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.40%  0.04%  -1.36 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nulsect0r/CVE-2019-12889", "ref_desc": "GitHub - nulsect0r/CVE-2019-12889Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
