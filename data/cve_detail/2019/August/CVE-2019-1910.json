{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1910", "Description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Intermediate System&ndash;to&ndash;Intermediate System (IS&ndash;IS) routing protocol functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker who is in the same IS&ndash;IS area to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of crafted IS&ndash;IS link-state protocol data units (PDUs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted link-state PDU to an affected system to be processed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all routers within the IS&ndash;IS area to unexpectedly restart the IS&ndash;IS process, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software earlier than Release 6.6.3 and are configured with the IS\u00e2\u20ac\u201cIS routing protocol. Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects both Cisco IOS XR 32-bit Software and Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1910", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  before (<) 6.6.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCarrier Routing System\u00bbVersion:7.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:carrier_routing_system:7.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-iosxr-isis-dos-1910", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software Intermediate System\u2013to\u2013Intermediate System Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
