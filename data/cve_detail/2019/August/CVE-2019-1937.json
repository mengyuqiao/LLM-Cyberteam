{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1937", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to acquire a valid session token with administrator privileges, bypassing user authentication. The vulnerability is due to insufficient request header validation during the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malicious requests to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to use the acquired session token to gain full administrator access to the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1937", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUcs DirectorVersions  from including (>=) 6.7.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 6.7.1.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUcs DirectorVersions  from including (>=) 6.6.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 6.6.1.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUcs Director\u00bbVersion:6.7(0.0.67265)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director:6.7\\(0.0.67265\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIntegrated Management Controller SupervisorVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0.3andup to, including, (<=) 2.2.0.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:integrated_management_controller_supervisor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUcs Director Express For Big DataVersions  from including (>=) 3.7.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.7.1.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director_express_for_big_data:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUcs Director Express For Big Data\u00bbVersion:3.6.0.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ucs_director_express_for_big_data:3.6.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "53.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  40.41%  53.12%  +12.71 \n 2  2024-10-25  43.52%  40.41%  -3.12 \n 3  2024-08-14  42.71%  43.52%  +0.81 \n 4  2024-07-12  40.64%  42.71%  +2.06 \n 5  2024-06-10  44.36%  40.64%  -3.72 \n 6  2024-04-17  43.71%  44.36%  +0.66 \n 7  2024-04-05  44.70%  43.71%  -0.99 \n 8  2023-11-30  37.04%  44.70%  +7.65 \n 9  2023-07-28  38.19%  37.04%  -1.14 \n 10  2023-07-18  20.74%  38.19%  +17.45 \n 11  2023-07-16  1.13%  20.74%  +19.61 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.21%  1.13%  -0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154308/Cisco-UCS-Director-Unauthenticated-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco UCS Director Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9t7EMF4w6WzA-7Itl2RjoPebFj4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173531/Cisco-UCS-IMC-Supervisor-2.2.0.0-Authentication-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco UCS-IMC Supervisor 2.2.0.0 Authentication Bypass \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154239/Cisco-UCS-IMC-Supervisor-Authentication-Bypass-Command-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco UCS / IMC Supervisor Authentication Bypass / Command Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fv40Vr4nOIM5s70ZzPxv1QtJRHk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-imcs-ucs-authby", "ref_desc": "Cisco Integrated Management Controller Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/36", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Multiple vulns in Cisco UCS Director: from unauth remote access to code execution as rootCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/K6DO-JRP1bQP9EoH4QYTOLW6HMA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/49", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Multiple vulns in Cisco UCS Director: from unauth remote access to code execution as rootThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yhtFJvEbEpKed0WJvTAwyC26hNA.html"}]}
