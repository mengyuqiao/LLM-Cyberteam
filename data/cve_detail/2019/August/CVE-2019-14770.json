{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14770", "Description": "In Backdrop CMS 1.12.x before 1.12.8 and 1.13.x before 1.13.3, some menu links within the administration bar may be crafted to execute JavaScript when the administrator is logged in and uses the search functionality. (This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing permissions to create administrative menu links, such as by creating a content type or layout. Such permissions are usually restricted to trusted or administrative users.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14770", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CoreVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.8cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_core:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CoreVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.3cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_core:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-010", "ref_desc": "Backdrop core - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CORE-2019-010 | Backdrop CMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
