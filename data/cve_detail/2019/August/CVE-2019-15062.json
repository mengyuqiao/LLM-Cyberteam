{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15062", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Dolibarr 11.0.0-alpha. A user can store an IFRAME element (containing a user/card.php CSRF request) in his Linked Files settings page. When visited by the admin, this could completely take over the admin account. (The protection mechanism for CSRF is to check the Referer header; however, because the attack is from one of the application's own settings pages, this mechanism is bypassed.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15062", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nDolibarr\u00bbDolibarr Erp/crm\u00bbVersion:11.0.0UpdateAlphacpe:2.3:a:dolibarr:dolibarr_erp\\/crm:11.0.0:alpha:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-05-01  0.14%  0.12%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-28  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/issues/11671", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS -> CSRF -> Admin Account Takeover \u00b7 Issue #11671 \u00b7 Dolibarr/dolibarr \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gauravnarwani.com/publications/CVE-2019-15062/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-15062 | I'm Gaurav NarwaniExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
