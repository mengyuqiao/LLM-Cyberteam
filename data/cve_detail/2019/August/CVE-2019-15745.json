{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15745", "Description": "The Eques elf smart plug and the mobile app use a hardcoded AES 256 bit key to encrypt the commands and responses between the device and the app. The communication happens over UDP port 27431. An attacker on the local network can use the same key to encrypt and send commands to discover all smart plugs in a network, take over control of a device, and perform actions such as turning it on and off.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15745", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEqueshome\u00bbElf Smart Plug Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:equeshome:elf_smart_plug_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Equeshome\u00bbElf Smart Plug\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-22  0.25%  0.35%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-10-08  0.20%  0.25%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.20%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.ckn.io/blog/2019/08/27/exploiting-the-eques-elf-smart-plug-part-one/", "ref_desc": "Exploiting the eques elf smart plug: Part one - The poetry of (in)securityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ckn.io/blog/2019/08/27/exploiting-the-eques-elf-smart-plug-part-four/", "ref_desc": "Exploiting the eques elf smart plug: Part four - The poetry of (in)securityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ckn.io/blog/2019/08/27/exploiting-the-eques-elf-smart-plug-part-two/", "ref_desc": "Exploiting the eques elf smart plug: Part two - The poetry of (in)securityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ckn.io/blog/2019/08/27/exploiting-the-eques-elf-smart-plug-part-three/", "ref_desc": "Exploiting the eques elf smart plug: Part three - The poetry of (in)securityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/iamckn/eques", "ref_desc": "GitHub - iamckn/eques: Exploit code/scripts for the eques elf smart plugsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
