{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1226", "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote Desktop Services \u2013 formerly known as Terminal Services \u2013 when an unauthenticated attacker connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests. This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the target systems Remote Desktop Service via RDP.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Remote Desktop Services handles connection requests.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1226", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1803cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1803:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1809cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1809:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1903cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1903:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows Server 2016\u00bbVersion:1803cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2016:1803:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows Server 2016\u00bbVersion:1903cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2016:1903:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMicrosoft\u00bbWindows Server 2019\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2019:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "11.75% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  13.29%  11.75%  -1.54 \n 2  2024-11-22  9.84%  13.29%  +3.45 \n 3  2024-08-07  11.86%  9.84%  -2.02 \n 4  2024-05-14  13.13%  11.86%  -1.27 \n 5  2024-01-10  11.25%  13.13%  +1.88 \n 6  2023-12-26  11.29%  11.25%  -0.04 \n 7  2023-06-03  10.85%  11.29%  +0.44 \n 8  2023-04-13  13.13%  10.85%  -2.28 \n 9  2023-03-11  10.08%  13.13%  +3.06 \n 10  2023-03-07  21.36%  10.08%  -11.29 \n 11  2023-02-08  17.27%  21.36%  +4.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-advisories/huawei-sa-20190819-01-windows-en", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory - Four Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Some Microsoft Windows SystemsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GYKsWbd08a3tFMWM7ri88i0fFxo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1226", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-1226 | Remote Desktop Services\u00a0Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-187667.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZGb-WvNjlyKPFjicrIsFlaQK-Jc.html"}]}
