{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1957", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco IoT Field Network Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger high CPU usage, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Transport Layer Security (TLS) renegotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending renegotiation requests at a high rate. A successful exploit could increase the resource usage on the system, eventually leading to a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1957", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIot Field Network DirectorVersions  before (<) 4.4.2-11cpe:2.3:a:cisco:iot_field_network_director:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-fnd-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director TLS Renegotiation Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
