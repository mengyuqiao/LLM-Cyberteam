{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1946", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and get limited access to the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of authentication in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication request to the web-based management interface on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view limited configuration details and potentially upload a virtual machine image.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1946", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Network Function Virtualization InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.10.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_network_function_virtualization_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-08  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-nfvis-authbypass", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software Web-Based Management Interface Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
