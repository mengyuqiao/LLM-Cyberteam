{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14422", "Description": "An issue was discovered in in TortoiseSVN 1.12.1. The Tsvncmd: URI handler allows a customised diff operation on Excel workbooks, which could be used to open remote workbooks without protection from macro security settings to execute arbitrary code. A tsvncmd:command:diff?path:[file1]?path2:[file2] URI will execute a customised diff on [file1] and [file2] based on the file extension. For xls files, it will execute the script diff-xls.js using wscript, which will open the two files for analysis without any macro security warning. An attacker can exploit this by putting a macro virus in a network drive, and force the victim to open the workbooks and execute the macro inside.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14422", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nTortoisesvn\u00bbTortoisesvn\u00bbVersion:1.12.1cpe:2.3:a:tortoisesvn:tortoisesvn:1.12.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-01  0.57%  0.46%  -0.11 \n 2  2024-08-26  0.59%  0.57%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-07-24  0.68%  0.59%  -0.08 \n 4  2024-07-06  0.69%  0.68%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-06-04  0.64%  0.69%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-05-02  0.63%  0.64%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-14  0.70%  0.63%  -0.07 \n 8  2023-03-07  5.08%  0.70%  -4.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/7", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: TortoiseSVN v1.12.1 - Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=2188", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
