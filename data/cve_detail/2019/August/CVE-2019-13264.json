{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13264", "Description": "D-link DIR-825AC G1 devices have Insufficient Compartmentalization between a host network and a guest network that are established by the same device. In order to transfer data from the host network to the guest network, the sender joins and then leaves an IGMP group. After it leaves, the router (following the IGMP protocol) creates an IGMP Membership Query packet with the Group IP and sends it to both the Host and the Guest networks. The data is transferred within the Group IP field, which is completely controlled by the sender.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13264", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDlink\u00bbDir-825/ac G1 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:dlink:dir-825\\/ac_g1_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDir-825/ac G1\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.17%  -0.07 \n 2  2023-04-28  0.10%  0.24%  +0.14 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_ovadia.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-KcWsidWN6U779z5pDpYR5q8wA4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://orenlab.sise.bgu.ac.il/publications/CrossRouter", "ref_desc": "Cross-Router Covert Channels | Oren Lab - Implementation Security and Side-Channel AttacksExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xgNzcPKuy3rl94ZaqqeWpqtWzjU.html"}]}
