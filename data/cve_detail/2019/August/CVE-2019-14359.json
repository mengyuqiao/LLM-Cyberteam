{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14359", "Description": "On BC Vault devices, a side channel for the row-based SSD1309 OLED display was found. The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels, allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example, a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover a data value. In other words, the side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device's USB connection to make power-consumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances, such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data. NOTE: the vendor's position is that there is no security impact: the only potentially leaked information is the number of characters in the PIN", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14359", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nReal-sec\u00bbBc Vault Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:real-sec:bc_vault_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Real-sec\u00bbBc Vault\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bc-vault.com/2019/08/our-response-to-cve-2019-14359", "ref_desc": "Our Response to CVE \u2013 2019 \u2013 14359 - BC VaultExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
