{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14771", "Description": "Backdrop CMS 1.12.x before 1.12.8 and 1.13.x before 1.13.3 allows the upload of entire-site configuration archives through the user interface or command line. It does not sufficiently check uploaded archives for invalid data, potentially allowing non-configuration scripts to be uploaded to the server. (This attack is mitigated by the attacker needing the \"Synchronize, import, and export configuration\" permission, a permission that only trusted administrators should be given. Other preventative measures in Backdrop CMS prevent the execution of PHP scripts, so another server-side scripting language must be accessible on the server to execute code.) Note: This has been disputed by multiple 3rd parties due to advanced permissions that are needed to exploit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14771", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CmsVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.3cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CmsVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.8cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-02  0.49%  0.48%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-09-16  0.41%  0.49%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.41%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-012", "ref_desc": "Backdrop core - Critical - Remote Code Execution - SA-CORE-2019-012 | Backdrop CMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
