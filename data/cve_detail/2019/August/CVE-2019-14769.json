{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14769", "Description": "Backdrop CMS 1.12.x before 1.12.8 and 1.13.x before 1.13.3 doesn't sufficiently filter output when displaying certain block labels created by administrators. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized label, then have an administrator execute scripting when administering a layout. (This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing permission to create custom blocks on the site, which is typically an administrative permission.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14769", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdropVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.8cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdropVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.3cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-011", "ref_desc": "Backdrop core - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CORE-2019-011 | Backdrop CMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
