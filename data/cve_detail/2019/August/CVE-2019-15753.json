{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15753", "Description": "In OpenStack os-vif 1.15.x before 1.15.2, and 1.16.0, a hard-coded MAC aging time of 0 disables MAC learning in linuxbridge, forcing obligatory Ethernet flooding of non-local destinations, which both impedes network performance and allows users to possibly view the content of packets for instances belonging to other tenants sharing the same network. Only deployments using the linuxbridge backend are affected. This occurs in PyRoute2.add() in internal/command/ip/linux/impl_pyroute2.py.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15753", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenstack\u00bbOs-vifVersions  from including (>=) 1.15.0andbefore (<) 1.15.2cpe:2.3:a:openstack:os-vif:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbOs-vif\u00bbVersion:1.16.0cpe:2.3:a:openstack:os-vif:1.16.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.43%  0.46%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-08-21  0.27%  0.43%  +0.17 \n 3  2023-07-02  0.28%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-06-17  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.23%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://review.opendev.org/672834", "ref_desc": "review.opendev Code ReviewPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2019-004.html", "ref_desc": "OpenStack Docs: OSSA-2019-004: Ageing time of 0 disables linuxbridge MAC learningPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/08/29/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [OSSA-2019-004] Ageing time of 0 disables linuxbridge MAC learning (CVE-2019-15753)Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://review.opendev.org/678098", "ref_desc": "Change I95612352: only disable mac ageing for ovs hybrid plug | review.opendev Code ReviewPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1837252", "ref_desc": "Bug #1837252 \u201c[OSSA-2019-004] Ageing time of 0 disables linuxbri...\u201d : Bugs : os-vifIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
