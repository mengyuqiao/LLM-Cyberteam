{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5638", "Description": "Rapid7 Nexpose versions 6.5.50 and prior suffer from insufficient session expiration when an administrator performs a security relevant edit on an existing, logged on user. For example, if a user's password is changed by an administrator due to an otherwise unrelated credential leak, that user account's current session is still valid after the password change, potentially allowing the attacker who originally compromised the credential to remain logged in and able to cause further damage.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5638", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRapid7\u00bbNexposeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.5.50cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:nexpose:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-17  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-10-10  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.20%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.rapid7.com/insightvm/enable-insightvm-platform-login", "ref_desc": "InsightVM Platform Login | InsightVM DocumentationCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/60egE723o-uiiYC1i6EwbiXLLD0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://help.rapid7.com/nexpose/en-us/release-notes/archive/2019/02/", "ref_desc": "Nexpose Release Notes Archive - February 2019Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
