{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1973", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web portal framework of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of log file content stored on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a log file with malicious code and getting a user to view the modified log file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1973", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Network Function Virtualization InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.11.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_network_function_virtualization_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-nfv-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software Cross-site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
