{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12643", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco REST API virtual service container for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication on the managed Cisco IOS XE device. The vulnerability is due to an improper check performed by the area of code that manages the REST API authentication service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious HTTP requests to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the token-id of an authenticated user. This token-id could be used to bypass authentication and execute privileged actions through the interface of the REST API virtual service container on the affected Cisco IOS XE device. The REST API interface is not enabled by default and must be installed and activated separately on IOS XE devices. See the Details section for more information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12643", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:15.5(3)s3.16cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:15.5\\(3\\)s3.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4221 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4321 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4331 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4351 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4431 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4451-x Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCloud Services Router 1000v\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:16.6.5cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4221 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4321 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4331 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4351 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4431 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4451-x Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCloud Services Router 1000v\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.74% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-19  2.45%  1.74%  -0.71 \n 2  2023-10-07  3.43%  2.45%  -0.98 \n 3  2023-07-08  3.50%  3.43%  -0.06 \n 4  2023-05-15  4.87%  3.50%  -1.37 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  4.87%  +3.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-iosxe-rest-auth-bypass", "ref_desc": "Cisco REST API Container for IOS XE Software Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
