{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1953", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web portal of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view a password in clear text. The vulnerability is due to incorrectly logging the admin password when a user is forced to modify the default password when logging in to the web portal for the first time. Subsequent password changes are not logged and other accounts are not affected. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by viewing the admin clear text password and using it to access the affected system. The attacker would need a valid user account to exploit this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1953", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Network Function Virtualization InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.9.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_network_function_virtualization_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-25  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-nfv-pwrecov", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software Password Recovery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
