{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1895", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) console implementation of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the VNC console session of an administrative user on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an insufficient authentication mechanism used to establish a VNC session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting an administrator VNC session request prior to login. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to watch the administrator console session or interact with it, allowing admin access to the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1895", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Network Function Virtualization InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.12.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_network_function_virtualization_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-24  0.51%  0.49%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.51%  -0.55 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-nfvis-vnc-authbypass", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software VNC Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
