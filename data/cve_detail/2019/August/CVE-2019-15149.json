{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15149", "Description": "core.py in Mitogen before 0.2.8 has a typo that drops the unidirectional-routing protection mechanism in the case of a child that is initiated by another child. The Ansible extension is unaffected. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because it is exploitable only in conjunction with hypothetical other factors, i.e., an affected use case within a library caller, and a bug in the message receiver policy code that led to reliance on this extra protection mechanism", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15149", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetworkgenomics\u00bbMitogenVersions  before (<) 0.2.8cpe:2.3:a:networkgenomics:mitogen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.22%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-254", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/254/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dw/mitogen/commit/5924af1566763e48c42028399ea0cd95c457b3dc", "ref_desc": "[security] core: undirectional routing wasn't respected in some cases \u00b7 dw/mitogen@5924af1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mitogen.networkgenomics.com/changelog.html#v0-2-8-2019-08-18", "ref_desc": "Release Notes \u2014 Mitogen DocumentationRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
