{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1961", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the improper input validation of tar packages uploaded through the Web Portal to the Image Repository. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted tar package and viewing the log entries that are generated. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying OS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1961", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Network Function Virtualization InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.10.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_network_function_virtualization_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-25  0.15%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-nfv-fileread", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software Web Portal Arbitrary File Read VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
