{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19331", "Description": "knot-resolver before version 4.3.0 is vulnerable to denial of service through high CPU utilization. DNS replies with very many resource records might be processed very inefficiently, in extreme cases taking even several CPU seconds for each such uncached message. For example, a few thousand A records can be squashed into one DNS message (limit is 64kB).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19331", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNIC\u00bbKnot ResolverVersions  before (<) 4.3.0cpe:2.3:a:nic:knot_resolver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-09  0.24%  0.33%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-11-06  0.25%  0.24%  0.00 \n 3  2024-04-26  0.11%  0.25%  +0.14 \n 4  2024-04-10  0.16%  0.11%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-407 Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/407/Inefficient-Algorithmic-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.knot-resolver.cz/2019-12-04-knot-resolver-4.3.0.html", "ref_desc": "Knot Resolver 4.3.0 released \u2013 Knot ResolverRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-19331", "ref_desc": "1779566 \u2013 (CVE-2019-19331) CVE-2019-19331 knot-resolver: DNS packets taking few seconds to process with full CPU utilization leads to DoSExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00017.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3795-1] knot-resolver security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/esTf2HmpAhgamG8Gd_Nmoc1F6RU.html"}]}
