{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13465", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the ROS communications-related packages (aka ros_comm or ros-melodic-ros-comm) through 1.14.3. ROS_ASSERT_MSG only works when ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is defined. This leads to a problem in the remove() function in clients/roscpp/src/libros/spinner.cpp. When ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is not defined, the iterator loop will run out of the scope of the array, and cause denial of service for other components (that depend on the communication-related functions of this package). NOTE: The reporter of this issue now believes it was a false alarm.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13465", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nROS\u00bbRos-commVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.14.3cpe:2.3:a:ros:ros-comm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/1748", "ref_desc": "Coverity - invalidate iterator cause overflow \u00b7 Issue #1748 \u00b7 ros/ros_comm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
