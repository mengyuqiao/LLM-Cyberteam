{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-15691", "Description": "TigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to stack use-after-return, which occurs due to incorrect usage of stack memory in ZRLEDecoder. If decoding routine would throw an exception, ZRLEDecoder may try to access stack variable, which has been already freed during the process of stack unwinding. Exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15691", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTigervnc\u00bbTigervncVersions  before (<) 1.10.1cpe:2.3:a:tigervnc:tigervnc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.84% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-19  0.66%  0.84%  +0.17 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.64%  0.66%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.64%  -3.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-672 Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/672/Operation-on-a-Resource-after-Expiration-or-Release.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-825 Expired Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/825/Expired-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/20/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - VNC vulnerabilities.
