{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16779", "Description": "In RubyGem excon before 0.71.0, there was a race condition around persistent connections, where a connection which is interrupted (such as by a timeout) would leave data on the socket. Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning content from the previous response. The race condition window appears to be short, and it would be difficult to purposefully exploit this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16779", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbBackports Sle\u00bbVersion:15.0UpdateSP1cpe:2.3:a:opensuse:backports_sle:15.0:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nExcon Project\u00bbExconVersions  before (<) 0.71.0cpe:2.3:a:excon_project:excon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.77%  0.52%  -0.24 \n 2  2024-12-09  0.79%  0.77%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-10-20  0.81%  0.79%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.68%  0.81%  +0.13 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.68%  -0.34 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-664 Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/664/Improper-Control-of-a-Resource-Through-its-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/excon/excon/security/advisories/GHSA-q58g-455p-8vw9", "ref_desc": "Interrupted Persistent Connections May Leak Response Data \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 excon/excon \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/excon/excon/commit/ccb57d7a422f020dc74f1de4e8fb505ab46d8a29", "ref_desc": "fix for leftover data with interrupted persistent connections \u00b7 excon/excon@ccb57d7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00021.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0036-1: moderate: Security update fThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00062.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0139-1: moderate: Security update fThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/01/msg00015.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2070-1] ruby-excon security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
