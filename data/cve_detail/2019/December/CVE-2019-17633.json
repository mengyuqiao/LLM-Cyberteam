{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17633", "Description": "For Eclipse Che versions 6.16 to 7.3.0, with both authentication and TLS disabled, visiting a malicious web site could trigger the start of an arbitrary Che workspace. Che with no authentication and no TLS is not usually deployed on a public network but is often used for local installations (e.g. on personal laptops). In that case, even if the Che API is not exposed externally, some javascript running in the local browser is able to send requests to it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17633", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbCHEVersions  from including (>=) 6.16.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.3.0cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:che:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-04-23  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  5.25%  0.12%  -5.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=551596", "ref_desc": "551596 \u2013 (CVE-2019-17633) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Web InterfaceExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
