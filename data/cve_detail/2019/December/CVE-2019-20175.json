{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-20175", "Description": "An issue was discovered in ide_dma_cb() in hw/ide/core.c in QEMU 2.4.0 through 4.2.0. The guest system can crash the QEMU process in the host system via a special SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND. It hits an assertion that implies that the size of successful DMA transfers there must be a multiple of 512 (the size of a sector). NOTE: a member of the QEMU security team disputes the significance of this issue because a \"privileged guest user has many ways to cause similar DoS effect, without triggering this assert.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20175", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nQemu\u00bbQemuVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:qemu:qemu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.17%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-11/msg02165.html", "ref_desc": "[PATCH v2 1/1] ide: check DMA transfer size in ide_dma_cb() to prevent qMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-11/msg00597.html", "ref_desc": "Re: [QEMU-SECURITY] ide: fix assertion in ide_dma_cb() to prevent qemu DThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg667396.html", "ref_desc": "[PATCH v3 0/2] ide: Fix incorrect handling of some PRDTs and add the corresponding unit-testPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-07/msg01651.html", "ref_desc": "[Qemu-devel] [QEMU-SECURITY] ide: fix assertion in ide_dma_cb() to preveExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel%40nongnu.org/msg667396.html", "ref_desc": "[PATCH v3 0/2] ide: Fix incorrect handling of some PRDTs and add the corresponding unit-test", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-07/msg03869.html", "ref_desc": "Re: [Qemu-devel] [Qemu-block] [QEMU-SECURITY] ide: fix assertion in ide_Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
