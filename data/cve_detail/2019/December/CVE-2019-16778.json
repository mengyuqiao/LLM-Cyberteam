{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16778", "Description": "In TensorFlow before 1.15, a heap buffer overflow in UnsortedSegmentSum can be produced when the Index template argument is int32. In this case data_size and num_segments fields are truncated from int64 to int32 and can produce negative numbers, resulting in accessing out of bounds heap memory. This is unlikely to be exploitable and was detected and fixed internally in TensorFlow 1.15 and 2.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16778", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.15.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-12-09  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-10-20  0.17%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.15%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-681 Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/681/Incorrect-Conversion-between-Numeric-Types.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-844w-j86r-4x2j", "ref_desc": "Heap buffer overflow in `UnsortedSegmentSum` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/db4f9717c41bccc3ce10099ab61996b246099892", "ref_desc": "Fix heap buffer overflow in UnsortedSegmentSum. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@db4f971 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2019-002.md", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/tfsa-2019-002.md at master \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
