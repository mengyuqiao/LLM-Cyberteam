{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19903", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.14.x before 1.14.2. It doesn't sufficiently filter output when displaying file type descriptions created by administrators. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized description, then have an administrator execute scripting when viewing the list of file types, aka XSS. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the \"Administer file types\" permission.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19903", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CmsVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.5cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CmsVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.14.2cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-015", "ref_desc": "Backdrop core - Moderately Critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CORE-2019-015 | Backdrop CMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
