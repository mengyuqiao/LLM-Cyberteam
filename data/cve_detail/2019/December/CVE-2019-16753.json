{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16753", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Decentralized Anonymous Payment System (DAPS) through 2019-08-26. The content to be signed is composed of a representation of strings, rather than being composed of their binary representations. This is a weak signature scheme design that would allow the reuse of signatures in some cases (or even the reuse of signatures, intended for one type of message, for another type). This also affects Private Instant Verified Transactions (PIVX) through 3.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16753", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPivx\u00bbPrivate Instant Verified TransactionsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.4.0cpe:2.3:a:pivx:private_instant_verified_transactions:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDecentralized Anonymous Payment System Project\u00bbDecentralized Anonymous Payment SystemVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2019-08-26cpe:2.3:a:decentralized_anonymous_payment_system_project:decentralized_anonymous_payment_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.78% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.59%  0.78%  +0.20 \n 2  2024-08-20  0.41%  0.59%  +0.17 \n 3  2023-11-10  0.33%  0.41%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-04-08  0.31%  0.33%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.31%  -0.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://officialdapscoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DAPS-Coin-Final-Security-Audit-Red4Sec-2019.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bYOXFbsF9UcmR2TkIHAWL3iSNXU.html"}]}
