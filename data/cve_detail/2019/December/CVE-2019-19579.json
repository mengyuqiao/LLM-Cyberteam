{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19579", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing attackers to gain host OS privileges via DMA in a situation where an untrusted domain has access to a physical device (and assignable-add is not used), because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-18424. XSA-302 relies on the use of libxl's \"assignable-add\" feature to prepare devices to be assigned to untrusted guests. Unfortunately, this is not considered a strictly required step for device assignment. The PCI passthrough documentation on the wiki describes alternate ways of preparing devices for assignment, and libvirt uses its own ways as well. Hosts where these \"alternate\" methods are used will still leave the system in a vulnerable state after the device comes back from a guest. An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into host memory, leading to privilege escalation. Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19579", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nXEN\u00bbXENVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.12.1cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:30cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:30:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.49%  0.34%  -0.15 \n 2  2024-11-27  0.32%  0.49%  +0.17 \n 3  2023-11-10  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.20%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-10-08  0.20%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-09-23  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.18%  0.17%  -1.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00011.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0011-1: important: Security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-KvYdxNvGJ9eTdS3JFjqE1tNvlk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4602", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4602-1 xenCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BJdejsUageN92xkVHLHt_omBG4Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/21", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: [SECURITY] [DSA 4602-1] xen security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cHl22zo_ZH_OJAV6vZjslHM0Xr0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/05/7", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 306 v3 (CVE-2019-19579) - Device quarantine for alternate pci assignment methodsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-306.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-306 - Xen Security AdvisoriesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-306.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-306 - Xen Security AdvisoriesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/11/26/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 306 v2 - Device quarantine for alternate pci assignment methodsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RJYT5FNGM7JSVHHW6B22TSAATBOAPFPD/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 30 Update: xen-4.11.2-4.fc30 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
