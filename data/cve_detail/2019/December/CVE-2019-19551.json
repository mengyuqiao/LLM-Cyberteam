An attacker with access to the User Control Panel application can submit malicious values in some of the time/date formatting and time-zone fields. These fields are not being properly sanitized. If this is done and a user (such as an admin) visits the User Management screen and views that user's profile, the XSS payload will render and execute in the context of the victim user's account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19551", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSangoma\u00bbFreepbxVersions  from including (>=) 13.0andup to, including, (<=) 13.0.76.43cpe:2.3:a:sangoma:freepbx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSangoma\u00bbFreepbxVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andup to, including, (<=) 14.0.7cpe:2.3:a:sangoma:freepbx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSangoma\u00bbFreepbxVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.0.20cpe:2.3:a:sangoma:freepbx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wiki.freepbx.org/display/FOP/2019-12-03+Multiple+XSS+Vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "2019-12-03 Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities - FreePBX OpenSource Project - DocumentationVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2c4GHKdKOR378P-WPUNRAaOVbG0.html"}]}
