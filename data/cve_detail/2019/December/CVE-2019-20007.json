{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-20007", "Description": "An issue was discovered in ezXML 0.8.2 through 0.8.6. The function ezxml_str2utf8, while parsing a crafted XML file, performs zero-length reallocation in ezxml.c, leading to returning a NULL pointer (in some compilers). After this, the function ezxml_parse_str does not check whether the s variable is not NULL in ezxml.c, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and crash (segmentation fault).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20007", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nEzxml Project\u00bbEzxmlVersions  from including (>=) 0.8.2andup to, including, (<=) 0.8.6cpe:2.3:a:ezxml_project:ezxml:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.14%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-05-08  0.13%  0.19%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sourceforge.net/p/ezxml/bugs/13/", "ref_desc": "ezXML / Bugs / #13 NULL pointer defererence (ezxml_parse_str)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
