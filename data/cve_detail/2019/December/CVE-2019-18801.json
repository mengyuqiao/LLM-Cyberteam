{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18801", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Envoy 1.12.0. An untrusted remote client may send HTTP/2 requests that write to the heap outside of the request buffers when the upstream is HTTP/1. This may be used to corrupt nearby heap contents (leading to a query-of-death scenario) or may be used to bypass Envoy's access control mechanisms such as path based routing. An attacker can also modify requests from other users that happen to be proximal temporally and spatially.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18801", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.12.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.44%  0.36%  -0.08 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.47%  0.44%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.47%  -0.55 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-gxvv-x4p2-rppp", "ref_desc": "Heap overflow via :method header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.envoyproxy.io", "ref_desc": "Envoy ProxyProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7t1JTu6HtJWQ5I9qbS4s55Iam6U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/envoy-users", "ref_desc": "envoy-users - Google GroepenThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LU7mH4lvVASkAtRRS68IbzliTMI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4222", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:4222 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commits/master", "ref_desc": "Commits \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WanmcAJSvp_89_FqhYg9fonkuNw.html"}]}
