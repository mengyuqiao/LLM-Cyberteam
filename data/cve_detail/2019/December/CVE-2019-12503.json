{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12503", "Description": "Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated data communication, the wireless barcode scanner Inateck BCST-60 is prone to keystroke injection attacks. Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's computer system, e.g., to install malware when the target system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control over the victim's computer that is operated with an affected receiver of this device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12503", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nInateck\u00bbBcst-60 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:inateck:bcst-60_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Inateck\u00bbBcst-60\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.53%  1.22%  +0.69 \n 2  2024-11-25  0.62%  0.53%  -0.09 \n 3  2024-07-17  0.80%  0.62%  -0.18 \n 4  2023-09-21  0.67%  0.80%  +0.13 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.67%  -0.29 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2019-027.txt", "ref_desc": "Broken Link;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155503/Inateck-BCST-60-Barcode-Scanner-Keystroke-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Inateck BCST-60 Barcode Scanner Keystroke Injection \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Nov/30", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2019-027]: Inateck BCST-60 Barcode Scanner - Keystroke Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2019-12503)Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
