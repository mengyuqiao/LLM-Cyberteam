{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5096", "Description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the processing of multi-part/form-data requests within the base GoAhead web server application in versions v5.0.1, v.4.1.1 and v3.6.5. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to a use-after-free condition during the processing of this request that can be used to corrupt heap structures that could lead to full code execution. The request can be unauthenticated in the form of GET or POST requests, and does not require the requested resource to exist on the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5096", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nEmbedthis\u00bbGoahead\u00bbVersion:3.6.5cpe:2.3:a:embedthis:goahead:3.6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEmbedthis\u00bbGoahead\u00bbVersion:4.1.1cpe:2.3:a:embedthis:goahead:4.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEmbedthis\u00bbGoahead\u00bbVersion:5.0.1cpe:2.3:a:embedthis:goahead:5.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "41.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  47.82%  41.18%  -6.64 \n 2  2024-02-28  48.21%  47.82%  -0.39 \n 3  2024-01-12  44.51%  48.21%  +3.70 \n 4  2023-11-09  39.31%  44.51%  +5.20 \n 5  2023-04-07  38.95%  39.31%  +0.37 \n 6  2023-03-07  15.36%  38.95%  +23.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2019-0888", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2019-0888 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
