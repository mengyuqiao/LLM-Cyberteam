{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19901", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.13.x before 1.13.5 and 1.14.x before 1.14.2. It doesn't sufficiently filter output when displaying certain block descriptions created by administrators. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized description, then have an administrator execute scripting when configuring a layout, aka XSS. This issue is mitigated by the fact that the attacker would be required to have the permission to create custom blocks, which is typically an administrative task.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19901", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CmsVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.5cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CmsVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.14.2cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-013", "ref_desc": "Backdrop core - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CORE-2019-013 | Backdrop CMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
