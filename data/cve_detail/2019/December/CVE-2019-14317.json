{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-14317", "Description": "wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.1.0 and earlier (formerly known as CyaSSL) generate biased DSA nonces. This allows a remote attacker to compute the long term private key from several hundred DSA signatures via a lattice attack. The issue occurs because dsa.c fixes two bits of the generated nonces.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14317", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWolfssl\u00bbWolfsslVersions  before (<) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:wolfssl:wolfssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/331/Insufficient-Entropy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "wolfSSL Security Vulnerabilities | wolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS LibraryPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xinqaZrISYAhowaQMjvidDuik6I.html"}]}
