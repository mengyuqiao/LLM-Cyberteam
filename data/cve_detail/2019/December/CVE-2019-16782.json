{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16782", "Description": "There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack (RubyGem rack). This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session. The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16782", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:31cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRack Project\u00bbRack\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.8cpe:2.3:a:rack_project:rack:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nRack Project\u00bbRack\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 1.6.12cpe:2.3:a:rack_project:rack:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.41%  0.34%  -0.07 \n 2  2024-12-11  0.25%  0.41%  +0.16 \n 3  2024-04-12  0.25%  0.25%  0.00 \n 4  2023-11-24  0.22%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.23%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-10-22  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.54%  0.24%  -1.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/18/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in RackMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/18/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in RackMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/19/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in RackMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/08/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in RackMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HZXMWILCICQLA2BYSP6I2CRMUG53YBLX/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: rubygem-rack-2.0.8-1.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-02/msg00016.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0214-1: moderate: Security update fThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WWZwdVHUc9AE1VndZQYutZWE2yg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-hrqr-hxpp-chr3", "ref_desc": "Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rack/rack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/09/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in RackMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/7fecaee81f59926b6e1913511c90650e76673b38", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'advisory-fix-1' \u00b7 rack/rack@7fecaee \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
