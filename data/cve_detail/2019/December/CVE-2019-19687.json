{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19687", "Description": "OpenStack Keystone 15.0.0 and 16.0.0 is affected by Data Leakage in the list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could (for example) leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP). Deployments with enforce_scope set to false are affected. (There will be a slight performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19687", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenstack\u00bbKeystone\u00bbVersion:15.0.0cpe:2.3:a:openstack:keystone:15.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbKeystone\u00bbVersion:16.0.0cpe:2.3:a:openstack:keystone:16.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.20%  1.60%  -0.60 \n 2  2024-12-02  1.79%  2.20%  +0.41 \n 3  2024-04-03  1.82%  1.79%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-10-30  1.34%  1.82%  +0.48 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.10%  1.34%  +0.24 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4358", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:4358 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://review.opendev.org/#/c/697611/", "ref_desc": "Change I5dd85a6b: Fix credential list for project members | review.opendev Code ReviewPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1855080", "ref_desc": "Bug #1855080 \u201cCredentials API allows listing and retrieving of a...\u201d : Bugs : OpenStack Identity (keystone)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://review.opendev.org/#/c/697731/", "ref_desc": "Change I5dd85a6b: Fix credential list for project members | review.opendev Code ReviewPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2019-006.html", "ref_desc": "OpenStack Docs: OSSA-2019-006: Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of all users credentialsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/11/8", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [OSSA-2019-006] Keystone: Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of all users credentials (CVE-2019-19687)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://review.opendev.org/#/c/697355/", "ref_desc": "Change I5dd85a6b: Fix credential list for project members | review.opendev Code ReviewPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4262-1/", "ref_desc": "USN-4262-1: OpenStack Keystone vulnerability | Ubuntu security notices", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
