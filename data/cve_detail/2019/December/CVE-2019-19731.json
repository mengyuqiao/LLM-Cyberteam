{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19731", "Description": "Roxy Fileman 1.4.5 for .NET is vulnerable to path traversal. A remote attacker can write uploaded files to arbitrary locations via the RENAMEFILE action. This can be leveraged for code execution by uploading a specially crafted Windows shortcut file and writing the file to the Startup folder (because an incomplete blacklist of file extensions allows Windows shortcut files to be uploaded).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19731", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nRoxyfileman\u00bbRoxy Fileman\u00bbVersion:1.4.5cpe:2.3:a:roxyfileman:roxy_fileman:1.4.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.00% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  6.30%  7.00%  +0.70 \n 2  2024-12-09  4.01%  6.30%  +2.30 \n 3  2024-11-06  4.09%  4.01%  -0.08 \n 4  2023-08-15  3.81%  4.09%  +0.27 \n 5  2023-05-21  2.73%  3.81%  +1.09 \n 6  2023-03-07  5.37%  2.73%  -2.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155666/Roxy-Fileman-1.4.5-For-.NET-Directory-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Roxy Fileman 1.4.5 For .NET Directory Traversal \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.roxyfileman.com/download", "ref_desc": "Roxy Fileman free downloadRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
