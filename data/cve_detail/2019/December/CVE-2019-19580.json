{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19580", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to gain host OS privileges by leveraging race conditions in pagetable promotion and demotion operations, because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-18421. XSA-299 addressed several critical issues in restartable PV type change operations. Despite extensive testing and auditing, some corner cases were missed. A malicious PV guest administrator may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the host. All security-supported versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability. Note that these attacks require very precise timing, which may be difficult to exploit in practice.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19580", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXEN\u00bbXEN\u00bbForX86Versions  up to, including, (<=) 4.12.1cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:31cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-04  0.29%  0.39%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-04-05  0.30%  0.29%  0.00 \n 3  2023-11-01  0.31%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.31%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00011.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2020:0011-1: important: Security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-KvYdxNvGJ9eTdS3JFjqE1tNvlk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D5R73AYE53QA32KTMHUVKCX6E52CIS43/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 31 Update: xen-4.12.1-8.fc31 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-zlmDzAvtO4BwSRcqu2t5igjdDo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4602", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4602-1 xenCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BJdejsUageN92xkVHLHt_omBG4Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/21", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: [SECURITY] [DSA 4602-1] xen security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cHl22zo_ZH_OJAV6vZjslHM0Xr0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-56", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202003-56) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iR4SK8X-vqoXKQ2dOMQjtwTs0w8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/34HBFTYNMQMWIO2GGK7DB6KV4M6R5YPV/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 30 Update: xen-4.11.3-2.fc30 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uGAKiymsRQDDutGyhqjSduMUmsM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-310.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-310 - Xen Security AdvisoriesPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
