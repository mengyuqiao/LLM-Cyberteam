{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18838", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Envoy 1.12.0. Upon receipt of a malformed HTTP request without a Host header, it sends an internally generated \"Invalid request\" response. This internally generated response is dispatched through the configured encoder filter chain before being sent to the client. An encoder filter that invokes route manager APIs that access a request's Host header causes a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in abnormal termination of the Envoy process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18838", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.12.1cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.40%  0.47%  +0.07 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.26%  0.40%  +0.13 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.26%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-f2rv-4w6x-rwhc", "ref_desc": "DoS via request without the Host header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.envoyproxy.io", "ref_desc": "Envoy ProxyProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7t1JTu6HtJWQ5I9qbS4s55Iam6U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/envoy-users", "ref_desc": "envoy-users - Google GroepenMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LU7mH4lvVASkAtRRS68IbzliTMI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commits/master", "ref_desc": "Commits \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WanmcAJSvp_89_FqhYg9fonkuNw.html"}]}
