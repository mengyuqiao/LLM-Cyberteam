{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17440", "Description": "Improper restriction of communications to Log Forwarding Card (LFC) on PA-7000 Series devices with second-generation Switch Management Card (SMC) may allow an attacker with network access to the LFC to gain root access to PAN-OS. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.0 versions prior to 9.0.5-h3 on PA-7080 and PA-7050 devices with an LFC installed and configured. This issue does not affect PA-7000 Series deployments using the first-generation SMC and the Log Processing Card (LPC). This issue does not affect any other PA series devices. This issue does not affect devices without an LFC. This issue does not affect PAN-OS 8.1 or prior releases. This issue only affected a very limited number of customers and we undertook individual outreach to help them upgrade. At the time of publication, all identified customers have upgraded SW or content and are not impacted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17440", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPaloaltonetworks\u00bbPan-osVersions  from including (>=) 9.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.0.5cpe:2.3:o:paloaltonetworks:pan-os:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Paloaltonetworks\u00bbPa-7050\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Paloaltonetworks\u00bbPa-7080\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-923 Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/923/Improper-Restriction-of-Communication-Channel-to-Intended-En.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2019-17440", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-17440 PAN-OS on PA-7000 Series: Improper restriction of communication to Log Forwarding Card (LFC) allows root access", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
