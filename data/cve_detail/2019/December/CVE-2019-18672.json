{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-18672", "Description": "Insufficient checks in the finite state machine of the ShapeShift KeepKey hardware wallet before firmware 6.2.2 allow a partial reset of cryptographic secrets to known values via crafted messages. Notably, this breaks the security of U2F for new server registrations and invalidates existing registrations. This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers and the interface is reachable via WebUSB.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18672", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShapeshift\u00bbKeepkey FirmwareVersions  before (<) 6.2.2cpe:2.3:o:shapeshift:keepkey_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Shapeshift\u00bbKeepkey Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.25%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-11-29  0.31%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-25  0.26%  0.31%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.26%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-354 Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/354/Improper-Validation-of-Integrity-Check-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/shapeshift-stories/shapeshift-security-update-8ec89bb1b4e3", "ref_desc": "ShapeShift Security Update - ShapeShift Stories - MediumThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/35clCsAKasqtCXKXjX9GdyZ_8Xw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://medium.com/shapeshift-stories/keepkey-release-notes-v-6f7d2ec78065", "ref_desc": "KeepKey Release Notes \u2014 v6.2.2 - ShapeShift Stories - MediumThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MOhVhkLITLpCuHuFC9k5lnqVk0U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.inhq.net/posts/keepkey-CVE-2019-18672/", "ref_desc": "KeepKey key erasure vulnerability (VULN-1971) | invd blog", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-firmware/commit/769714fcb569e7a4faff9530a2d9ac1f9d6e5680", "ref_desc": "firmware: stronger recovery state machine checks \u00b7 keepkey/keepkey-firmware@769714f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
