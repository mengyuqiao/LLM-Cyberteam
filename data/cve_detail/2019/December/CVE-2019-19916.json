{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19916", "Description": "In Midori Browser 0.5.11 (on Windows 10), Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the multipart/x-mixed-replace MIME type. This could result in script running where CSP should have blocked it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks when the product renders the content as HTML. Remediating this would also need to consider the polyglot case, e.g., a file that is a valid GIF image and also valid JavaScript.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19916", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMidori-browser\u00bbMidori\u00bbVersion:0.5.11cpe:2.3:a:midori-browser:midori:0.5.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 2  2024-12-13  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-09-06  0.09%  0.17%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/V1n1v131r4/MIME-Confusion-Attack-on-Midori-Browser/blob/master/README.md", "ref_desc": "MIME-Confusion-Attack-on-Midori-Browser/README.md at master \u00b7 V1n1v131r4/MIME-Confusion-Attack-on-Midori-Browser \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://portswigger.net/research/bypassing-csp-using-polyglot-jpegs", "ref_desc": "Bypassing CSP using polyglot JPEGs | PortSwigger ResearchExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/08/26/mitigating-mime-confusion-attacks-in-firefox/", "ref_desc": "Mitigating MIME Confusion Attacks in Firefox | Mozilla Security BlogThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
