{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16770", "Description": "In Puma before versions 3.12.2 and 4.3.1, a poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack. If more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough. This vulnerability is patched in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16770", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.3.1cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.12.2cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-30  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00034.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3023-1] puma security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/c1dxmUowF3fFRRcvVYDwHSg7eCQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-7xx3-m584-x994", "ref_desc": "Keepalive thread overload/DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 puma/puma \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
