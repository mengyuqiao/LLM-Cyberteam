{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19902", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.13.x before 1.13.5 and 1.14.x before 1.14.2. It allows the upload of entire-site configuration archives through the user interface or command line. It does not sufficiently check uploaded archives for invalid data, allowing non-configuration scripts to potentially be uploaded to the server. This issue is mitigated by the fact that the attacker would be required to have the \"Synchronize, import, and export configuration\" permission, a permission that only trusted administrators should be given. Other measures in the product prevent the execution of PHP scripts, so another server-side scripting language must be accessible on the server to execute code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19902", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CmsVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.5cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBackdropcms\u00bbBackdrop CmsVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.14.2cpe:2.3:a:backdropcms:backdrop_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-22  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.14%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-016", "ref_desc": "Backdrop core - Critical - Remote Code Execution - SA-CORE-2019-016 | Backdrop CMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
