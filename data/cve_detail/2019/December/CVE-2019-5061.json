{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-5061", "Description": "An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the hostapd 2.6, where an attacker could trigger AP to send IAPP location updates for stations, before the required authentication process has completed. This could lead to different denial of service scenarios, either by causing CAM table attacks, or by leading to traffic flapping if faking already existing clients in other nearby Aps of the same wireless infrastructure. An attacker can forge Authentication and Association Request packets to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5061", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nW1.fi\u00bbHostapd\u00bbVersion:2.6cpe:2.3:a:w1.fi:hostapd:2.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-440 Expected Behavior Violation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/440/Expected-Behavior-Violation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2019-0849", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2019-0849 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
