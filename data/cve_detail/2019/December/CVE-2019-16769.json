{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16769", "Description": "The serialize-javascript npm package before version 2.1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions. This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions. If serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16769", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nVerizon\u00bbSerialize-javascript\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.1.1cpe:2.3:a:verizon:serialize-javascript:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript/security/advisories/GHSA-h9rv-jmmf-4pgx", "ref_desc": "regular expressions Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yahoo/serialize-javascript \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
