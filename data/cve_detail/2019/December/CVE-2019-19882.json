{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19882", "Description": "shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux, and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid programs are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19882", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShadow Project\u00bbShadow\u00bbVersion:4.8cpe:2.3:a:shadow_project:shadow:4.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836", "ref_desc": "FS#64836 : [shadow] useradd, groupadd, etc. are now setuid-rootExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75", "ref_desc": "Fix failing chmod calls on installation for suidubins \u00b7 shadow-maint/shadow@edf7547 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-09", "ref_desc": "Shadow: Privilege escalation (GLSA 202008-09) \u2014 Gentoo security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252", "ref_desc": "702252 \u2013 (CVE-2019-19882) sys-apps/shadow-4.8-r1[pam] installs setuid binaries with permissive pam configuration allowing user/group management without authentication (CVE-2019-19882)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199", "ref_desc": "Don't auto-enable ACCT_TOOLS_SETUID if PAM is detected by falconindy \u00b7 Pull Request #199 \u00b7 shadow-maint/shadow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580", "ref_desc": "shadow: reduce the number of suid programs by Duncaen \u00b7 Pull Request #17580 \u00b7 void-linux/void-packages \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
