{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16772", "Description": "The serialize-to-js NPM package before version 3.0.1 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions. This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions. If serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16772", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSerialize-to-js Project\u00bbSerialize-to-js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:serialize-to-js_project:serialize-to-js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/commenthol/serialize-to-js/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjq-93xj-3f3f", "ref_desc": "regular expressions Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 commenthol/serialize-to-js \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/commenthol/serialize-to-js/commit/181d7d583ae5293cd47cc99b14ad13352875f3e3", "ref_desc": "fix: for ghsa-3fjq-93xj-3f3f \u00b7 commenthol/serialize-to-js@181d7d5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
