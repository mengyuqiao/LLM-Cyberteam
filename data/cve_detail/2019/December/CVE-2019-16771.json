{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16771", "Description": "Versions of Armeria 0.85.0 through and including 0.96.0 are vulnerable to HTTP response splitting, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via CRLF sequences when unsanitized data is used to populate the headers of an HTTP response. This vulnerability has been patched in 0.97.0. Potential impacts of this vulnerability include cross-user defacement, cache poisoning, Cross-site scripting (XSS), and page hijacking.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16771", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nLinecorp\u00bbArmeriaVersions  from including (>=) 0.85.0andbefore (<) 0.97.0cpe:2.3:a:linecorp:armeria:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.12%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.17%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/113/Improper-Neutralization-of-CRLF-Sequences-in-HTTP-Headers-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/line/armeria/security/advisories/GHSA-35fr-h7jr-hh86", "ref_desc": "CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 line/armeria \u00b7 GitHubMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/line/armeria/commit/b597f7a865a527a84ee3d6937075cfbb4470ed20", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-35fr-h7jr-hh86 \u00b7 line/armeria@b597f7a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
