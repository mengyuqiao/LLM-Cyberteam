{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19774", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Zoho ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer 10.0 SP1 before Build 12110. By running \"select hostdetails from hostdetails\" at the /event/runquery.do endpoint, it is possible to bypass the security restrictions that prevent even administrative users from viewing credential data stored in the database, and recover the MD5 hashes of the accounts used to authenticate the ManageEngine platform to the managed machines on the network (most often administrative accounts). Specifically, this bypasses these restrictions: a query cannot mention password, and a query result cannot have a password column.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19774", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZohocorp\u00bbManageengine Eventlog AnalyzerVersions  from including (>=) 10.0andbefore (<) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:zohocorp:manageengine_eventlog_analyzer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "8.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.84%  8.10%  +4.26 \n 2  2024-12-06  3.80%  3.84%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-11-03  3.88%  3.80%  -0.08 \n 4  2024-10-02  3.32%  3.88%  +0.55 \n 5  2024-09-12  2.93%  3.32%  +0.39 \n 6  2024-08-09  3.46%  2.93%  -0.53 \n 7  2023-10-02  3.22%  3.46%  +0.24 \n 8  2023-08-30  3.26%  3.22%  -0.04 \n 9  2023-07-27  2.88%  3.26%  +0.38 \n 10  2023-07-08  4.03%  2.88%  -1.16 \n 11  2023-06-04  3.94%  4.03%  +0.09 \n 12  2023-05-18  3.08%  3.94%  +0.86 \n 13  2023-05-02  2.75%  3.08%  +0.33 \n 14  2023-03-31  2.74%  2.75%  +0.01 \n 15  2023-03-07  7.31%  2.74%  -4.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.manageengine.com/products/eventlog/features-new.html#release", "ref_desc": "Eventlog Analyzer Latest FeaturesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/75MvCKs9ZSU5QJ2heogDUt2RfEU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/scottgoodwin90/19ccecdc9f5733c0a9381765cfc7fe39", "ref_desc": "Authenticated Information Disclosure in ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156485/ManageEngine-EventLog-Analyzer-10.0-Information-Disclosure.html", "ref_desc": "ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer 10.0 Information Disclosure \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
