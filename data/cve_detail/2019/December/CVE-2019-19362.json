{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-19362", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Chat functionality of the TeamViewer desktop application 14.3.4730 on Windows. (The vendor states that it was later fixed.) Upon login, every communication is saved within Windows main memory. When a user logs out or deletes conversation history (but does not exit the application), this data is not wiped from main memory, and therefore could be read by a local user with the same or greater privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19362", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTeamviewer\u00bbTeamviewer\u00bbVersion:14.3.4730cpe:2.3:a:teamviewer:teamviewer:14.3.4730:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/212/Improper-Removal-of-Sensitive-Information-Before-Storage-or-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://nestedif.com/teamviewer-vulnerability-improper-session-handling-leading-to-information-disclosure-advisory/", "ref_desc": "TeamViewer Vulnerability - Improper Session Handling leading to Information Disclosure Advisory - Nested IFExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
