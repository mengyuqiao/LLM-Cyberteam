{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7727", "Description": "In NICE Engage through 6.5, the default configuration binds an unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface to all network interfaces, without restricting registration of MBeans, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the RMI protocol by using the JMX connector. The observed affected TCP port is 6338 but, based on the product's configuration, a different one could be vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7727", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNice\u00bbEngageVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.5cpe:2.3:a:nice:engage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "16.59% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.78%  16.59%  +12.82 \n 2  2024-09-13  3.64%  3.78%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-04-16  2.60%  3.64%  +1.04 \n 4  2023-12-07  2.70%  2.60%  -0.10 \n 5  2023-03-07  5.63%  2.70%  -2.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://redtimmysec.wordpress.com/2019/03/26/jmx-rmi-multiple-applications-rce/", "ref_desc": "JMX RMI \u2013 Multiple Applications (RCE) \u2013 Red Timmy Security (https://twitter.com/redtimmysec)Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Apr/4", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CVE-2019-7727 - JMX/RMI Nice ENGAGE <= 6.5 Remote Command ExecutionMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Apr/2", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: CVE-2019-7727 - JMX/RMI Nice ENGAGE <= 6.5 Remote Command ExecutionMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
