{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11444", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Liferay Portal CE 7.1.2 GA3. An attacker can use Liferay's Groovy script console to execute OS commands. Commands can be executed via a [command].execute() call, as demonstrated by \"def cmd =\" in the ServerAdminPortlet_script value to group/control_panel/manage. Valid credentials for an application administrator user account are required. NOTE: The developer disputes this as a vulnerability since it is a feature for administrators to run groovy scripts and therefore not a design flaw", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11444", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLiferay\u00bbLiferay Portal\u00bbVersion:7.1.2UpdateGA3cpe:2.3:a:liferay:liferay_portal:7.1.2:ga3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.43%  4.25%  -0.18 \n 2  2024-09-12  4.49%  4.43%  -0.06 \n 3  2024-06-08  5.32%  4.49%  -0.83 \n 4  2024-05-03  6.16%  5.32%  -0.84 \n 5  2024-04-15  5.19%  6.16%  +0.97 \n 6  2024-03-13  5.29%  5.19%  -0.10 \n 7  2024-02-10  5.72%  5.29%  -0.43 \n 8  2023-12-18  5.88%  5.72%  -0.16 \n 9  2023-10-19  6.15%  5.88%  -0.27 \n 10  2023-09-03  5.88%  6.15%  +0.27 \n 11  2023-03-07  7.31%  5.88%  -1.43 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/running-scripts-from-the-script-console", "ref_desc": "Running Scripts From the Script Console", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46525", "ref_desc": "Liferay CE Portal < 7.1.2 ga3 - Remote Command Execution (Metasploit)Exploit;VDB Entry;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pentest.com.tr/exploits/Liferay-CE-Portal-Tomcat-7-1-2-ga3-Groovy-Console-Remote-Command-Execution-Metasploit.html", "ref_desc": "Pentest Blog - Self-Improvement to Ethical HackingExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
