{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18068", "Description": "The ARM-based hardware debugging feature on Raspberry Pi 3 module B+ and possibly other devices allows non-secure EL1 code to read/write any EL3 (the highest privilege level in ARMv8) memory/register via inter-processor debugging. With a debug host processor A running in non-secure EL1 and a debug target processor B running in any privilege level, the debugging feature allows A to halt B and promote B to any privilege level. As a debug host, A has full control of B even if B owns a higher privilege level than A. Accordingly, A can read/write any EL3 memory/register via B. Also, with this memory access, A can execute arbitrary code in EL3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18068", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nRaspberrypi\u00bbRaspberry Pi 3 Model B+ Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Raspberrypi\u00bbRaspberry Pi 3 Model B+\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "2.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.22%  2.24%  +1.03 \n 2  2024-08-25  1.33%  1.22%  -0.11 \n 3  2024-03-13  0.94%  1.33%  +0.39 \n 4  2023-05-14  0.80%  0.94%  +0.14 \n 5  2023-03-11  0.63%  0.80%  +0.17 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.63%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.cs.wayne.edu/fengwei/paper/nailgun-sp19.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2019/666000b157/17D45WHONhv", "ref_desc": "CSDL | IEEE Computer SocietyThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
