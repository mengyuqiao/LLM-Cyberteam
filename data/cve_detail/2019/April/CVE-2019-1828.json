{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1828", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access administrative credentials. The vulnerability exists because affected devices use weak encryption algorithms for user credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack and decrypting intercepted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to an affected device with administrator privileges. This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running firmware releases prior to 1.4.2.22.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1828", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv320 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.4.2.22cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv320_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv320\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv325 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.4.2.22cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv325_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv325\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.17%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107774", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers CVE-2019-1828 Weak Encryption Security WeaknessThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190404-rv-weak-encrypt", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Weak Credential Encryption VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
