{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1802", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a report containing malicious content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Versions 6.2.3, 6.3.0, and 6.4.0 are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1802", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.2.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.4.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:6.3.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:6.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-cfmc-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Management Center Persistent Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107995", "ref_desc": "Cisco Firepower Management Center CVE-2019-1802 HTML Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
