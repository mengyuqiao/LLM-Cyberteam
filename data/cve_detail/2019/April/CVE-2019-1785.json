{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1785", "Description": "A vulnerability in the RAR file scanning functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and 0.101.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper error-handling mechanisms when processing nested RAR files sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RAR file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to view or create arbitrary files on the targeted system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1785", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nClamav\u00bbClamav\u00bbVersion:0.101.0cpe:2.3:a:clamav:clamav:0.101.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nClamav\u00bbClamav\u00bbVersion:0.101.1cpe:2.3:a:clamav:clamav:0.101.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=12284", "ref_desc": "Bug 12284 \u2013 cli_gentemp_with_prefix traversalIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201904-12", "ref_desc": "ClamAV: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201904-12) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U_nUK6kCtdpgK5yGvjYfkZI5Xts.html"}]}
