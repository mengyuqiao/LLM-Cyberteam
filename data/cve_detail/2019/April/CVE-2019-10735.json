{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10735", "Description": "In Claws Mail 3.14.1, an attacker in possession of S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails can wrap them as sub-parts within a crafted multipart email. The encrypted part(s) can further be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII newline characters. This modified multipart email can be re-sent by the attacker to the intended receiver. If the receiver replies to this (benign looking) email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext of the encrypted message part(s) back to the attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10735", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nClaws-mail\u00bbMail\u00bbVersion:3.14.1cpe:2.3:a:claws-mail:mail:3.14.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/claws-mail/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4159", "ref_desc": "Bug 4159 \u2013 Decryption Oracle based on replying to PGP or S/MIME encrypted emailsExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
