{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1787", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Portable Document Format (PDF) scanning functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data handling mechanisms within the device buffer while indexing remaining file data on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted PDF files to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap buffer out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition on an affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1787", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:42.3cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:42.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensuse\u00bbLeap\u00bbVersion:15.0cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nClamav\u00bbClamavVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.101.1cpe:2.3:a:clamav:clamav:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.45%  +0.19 \n 2  2024-08-29  0.36%  0.26%  -0.11 \n 3  2024-07-17  0.51%  0.36%  -0.15 \n 4  2024-04-01  0.36%  0.51%  +0.15 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.21%  0.36%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00064.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2019:1208-1: important: Security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/edrajAy469s1Hc7F99T_sDKerpE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201904-12", "ref_desc": "ClamAV: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201904-12) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U_nUK6kCtdpgK5yGvjYfkZI5Xts.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00062.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2019:1210-1: important: Security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ukgOK-ewJYMQGZYWXR8R-5s3F-Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/04/msg00019.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1759-1] clamav security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Up-7INY0WWsVoaG7PzR-TrqhWJY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=12181", "ref_desc": "12181 - clamav/clamav_scanmap_PDF_fuzzer: Heap-buffer-overflow in pdf_nextlinestart - oss-fuzz - MonorailExploit;Issue Tracking;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
