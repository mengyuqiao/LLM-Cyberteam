{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1797", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on the device with the privileges of the user, including modifying the device configuration. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an interface user to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the device with the privileges of the user. Software versions prior to 8.3.150.0, 8.5.135.0, and 8.8.100.0 are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1797", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller SoftwareVersions  before (<) 8.3.150.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 8.5.131.0andbefore (<) 8.5.150.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 8.7.106.0andbefore (<) 8.8.100.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-09-07  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-09-13  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-05-27  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107998", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software CVE-2019-1797 Cross Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-wlc-csrf", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
