{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3938", "Description": "Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2 stores usernames, passwords, and other configuration options in the file generated via the \"export configuration\" feature. The configuration file is encrypted using the awenc binary. The same binary can be used to decrypt any configuration file since all the encryption logic is hard coded. A local attacker can use this vulnerability to gain access to devices username and passwords.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3938", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCrestron\u00bbAm-100 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.6.0.2cpe:2.3:o:crestron:am-100_firmware:1.6.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Crestron\u00bbAm-100\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCrestron\u00bbAm-101 Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.7.0.2cpe:2.3:o:crestron:am-101_firmware:2.7.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Crestron\u00bbAm-101\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 \n 2  2023-02-23  3.76%  0.89%  -2.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-20", "ref_desc": "OEM Presentation Platform Vulnerabilities - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rQADtBd0w-b1pjiwmQfrDZ-_QHE.html"}]}
