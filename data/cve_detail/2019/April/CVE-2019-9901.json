{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9901", "Description": "Envoy 1.9.0 and before does not normalize HTTP URL paths. A remote attacker may craft a relative path, e.g., something/../admin, to bypass access control, e.g., a block on /admin. A backend server could then interpret the non-normalized path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9901", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.36%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-18  0.43%  0.36%  -0.08 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.48%  0.43%  -0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.21%  0.48%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/706/Use-of-Incorrectly-Resolved-Name-or-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-xcx5-93pw-jw2w", "ref_desc": "Missing HTTP URL path normalization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/envoy-announce/VoHfnDqZiAM", "ref_desc": "Google GroepenPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dBLq-zTA2g-E5LsI6EbaKt9BMZk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.9.1/intro/version_history", "ref_desc": "Version history \u2014 envoy tag-v1.9.1 documentationRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hr63S_ejndnbFZy8vmRTHYDcAYw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/6435", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-9901 \u00b7 Issue #6435 \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
