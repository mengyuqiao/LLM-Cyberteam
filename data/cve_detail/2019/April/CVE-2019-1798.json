{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1798", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Portable Executable (PE) file scanning functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input and validation checking mechanisms for PE files sent an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed PE files to the device running an affected version ClamAV Software. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition on an affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1798", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nClamav\u00bbClamavVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.101.1cpe:2.3:a:clamav:clamav:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=12262", "ref_desc": "Bug 12262 \u2013 Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.Issue Tracking;Exploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201904-12", "ref_desc": "ClamAV: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201904-12) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U_nUK6kCtdpgK5yGvjYfkZI5Xts.html"}]}
