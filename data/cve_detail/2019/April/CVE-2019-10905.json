{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10905", "Description": "Parsedown before 1.7.2, when safe mode is used and HTML markup is disabled, might allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code if a script (already running on the affected page) executes the contents of any element with a specific class. This occurs because spaces are permitted in code block infostrings, which interferes with the intended behavior of a single class name beginning with the language- substring.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10905", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nParsedown\u00bbParsedownVersions  before (<) 1.7.2cpe:2.3:a:parsedown:parsedown:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.26%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-08-27  0.22%  0.21%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/erusev/parsedown/releases/tag/1.7.2", "ref_desc": "Release 1.7.2 \u00b7 erusev/parsedown \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/erusev/parsedown/issues/699", "ref_desc": "Injecting classnames into code blocks \u00b7 Issue #699 \u00b7 erusev/parsedown \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
