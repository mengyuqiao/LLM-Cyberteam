{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1710", "Description": "A vulnerability in the sysadmin virtual machine (VM) on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access internal applications running on the sysadmin VM. The vulnerability is due to incorrect isolation of the secondary management interface from internal sysadmin applications. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to one of the listening internal applications. A successful exploit could result in unstable conditions, including both a denial of service and remote unauthenticated access to the device. This vulnerability has been fixed in Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software Release 6.5.3 and 7.0.1, which will edit the calvados_boostrap.cfg file and reload the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1710", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xr\u00bbForX64Versions  before (<) 6.5.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:x64:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9000\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIos Xr\u00bbForX64Versions  from including (>=) 7.0andbefore (<) 7.0.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:x64:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 9000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.46%  0.20%  -0.26 \n 2  2024-09-07  0.50%  0.46%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-05-27  0.35%  0.50%  +0.15 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.35%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-asr9k-exr", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR 64-Bit Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Network Isolation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108007", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software CVE-2019-1710 Unauthorized Access VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
