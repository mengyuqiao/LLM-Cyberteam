{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-19282", "Description": "Rockwell Automation PowerFlex 525 AC Drives 5.001 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by crashing the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) network stack. The vulnerability allows the attacker to crash the CIP in a way that it does not accept new connections, but keeps the current connections active, which can prevent legitimate users from recovering control.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19282", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRockwellautomation\u00bbPowerflex 525 Ac Drives FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.001cpe:2.3:o:rockwellautomation:powerflex_525_ac_drives_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Rockwellautomation\u00bbPowerflex 525 Ac Drives\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.09%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-03-28  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-02-08  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 5  2024-01-03  0.10%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.10%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-087-01", "ref_desc": "Rockwell Automation PowerFlex 525 AC Drives | CISAUS Government Resource;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://applied-risk.com/application/files/4215/5385/2294/Advisory_AR2019004_Rockwell_Powerflex_525_Denial_of_Service.pdf", "ref_desc": "Applied Risk - Applied RiskThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
