{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-20321", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Rancher 2 through 2.1.5. Any project member with access to the default namespace can mount the netes-default service account in a pod, and then use that pod to execute administrative privileged commands against the k8s cluster. This could be mitigated by isolating the default namespace in a separate project, where only cluster admins can be given permissions to access. As of 2018-12-20, this bug affected ALL clusters created or imported by Rancher.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20321", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSuse\u00bbRancherVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.1.5cpe:2.3:a:suse:rancher:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://forums.rancher.com/c/announcements", "ref_desc": "Latest Announcements topics - Rancher LabsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Kdp0bGBoeCWOamEkIP3XwguV6fw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://rancher.com/blog/2019/2019-01-29-explaining-security-vulnerabilities-addressed-in-rancher-v2-1-6-and-v2-0-11/", "ref_desc": "Explaining security vulnerabilities addressed in Rancher v2.1.6 and v2.0.11Mitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KKl18rTcRkuOO1i3ZYe_cmUxSUQ.html"}]}
