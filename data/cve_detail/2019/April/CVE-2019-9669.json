{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9669", "Description": "The Wordfence plugin 7.2.3 for WordPress allows XSS via a unique attack vector. NOTE: It has been asserted that this is not a valid vulnerability in the context of the Wordfence WordPress plugin as the firewall rules are not maintained as part of the Wordfence software but rather it is a set of rules hosted on vendor servers and pushed to the plugin with no versioning associated. Bypassing a WAF rule doesn't make a WordPress site vulnerable (speaking in terms of software vulnerabilities)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9669", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nWordfence\u00bbWordfence\u00bbVersion:7.2.3ForWordpresscpe:2.3:a:wordfence:wordfence:7.2.3:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-02-08  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.edgescan.com/popular-wordpress-waf-bypass-zeroday-discovered-by-edgescan/", "ref_desc": "Popular Wordpress WAF bypass Zeroday discovered by edgescan - Cyber Security, Security Scan, Full Stack Vulnerability ManagementExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
