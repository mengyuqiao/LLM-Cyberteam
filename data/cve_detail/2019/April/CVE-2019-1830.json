{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1830", "Description": "A vulnerability in Locally Significant Certificate (LSC) management for the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly restart, which causes a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation of the HTTP URL used to establish a connection to the LSC Certificate Authority (CA). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and configuring a LSC certificate. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to an unexpected restart of the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1830", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 8.6.101.0andbefore (<) 8.8.100.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 8.5.131.0andbefore (<) 8.5.140.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller SoftwareVersions  before (<) 8.3.150.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-wlc-cert-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Locally Significant Certificate Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108028", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller CVE-2019-1830 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
