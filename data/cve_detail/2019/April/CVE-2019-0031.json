{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-0031", "Description": "Specific IPv6 DHCP packets received by the jdhcpd daemon will cause a memory resource consumption issue to occur on a Junos OS device using the jdhcpd daemon configured to respond to IPv6 requests. Once started, memory consumption will eventually impact any IPv4 or IPv6 request serviced by the jdhcpd daemon, thus creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition to clients requesting and not receiving IP addresses. Additionally, some clients which were previously holding IPv6 addresses will not have their IPv6 Identity Association (IA) address and network tables agreed upon by the jdhcpd daemon after the failover event occurs, which leads to more than one interface, and multiple IP addresses, being denied on the client. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0031", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nJuniper\u00bbJunosVersions  from including (>=) 17.4andbefore (<) 17.4r2cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJuniper\u00bbJunosVersions  from including (>=) 18.1andbefore (<) 18.1r2cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-31  0.11%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107874", "ref_desc": "Juniper Junos CVE-2019-0031 Remote Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kb.juniper.net/JSA10920", "ref_desc": "Juniper Networks - 2019-04 Security Bulletin: Junos OS: jdhcpd daemon memory consumption Denial of Service when receiving specific IPv6 DHCP packets.
