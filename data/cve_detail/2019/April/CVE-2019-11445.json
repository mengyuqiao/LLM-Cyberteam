{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11445", "Description": "OpenKM 6.3.2 through 6.3.7 allows an attacker to upload a malicious JSP file into the /okm:root directories and move that file to the home directory of the site, via frontend/FileUpload and admin/repository_export.jsp. This is achieved by interfering with the Filesystem path control in the admin's Export field. As a result, attackers can gain remote code execution through the application server with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11445", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpenkm\u00bbOpenkmVersions  before (<) 6.3.7cpe:2.3:a:openkm:openkm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "6.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-09  5.45%  6.29%  +0.84 \n 2  2024-11-15  4.54%  5.45%  +0.91 \n 3  2024-10-03  3.77%  4.54%  +0.77 \n 4  2024-09-12  3.82%  3.77%  -0.05 \n 5  2024-06-26  5.32%  3.82%  -1.49 \n 6  2024-05-20  8.06%  5.32%  -2.74 \n 7  2024-04-15  4.37%  8.06%  +3.69 \n 8  2024-03-13  4.46%  4.37%  -0.09 \n 9  2023-10-19  3.19%  4.46%  +1.26 \n 10  2023-07-18  3.08%  3.19%  +0.11 \n 11  2023-03-07  5.16%  3.08%  -2.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46526", "ref_desc": "OpenKM 6.3.2 < 6.3.7 - Remote Command Execution (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pentest.com.tr/exploits/OpenKM-DM-6-3-7-Remote-Command-Execution-Metasploit.html", "ref_desc": "Pentest Blog - Self-Improvement to Ethical HackingExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
