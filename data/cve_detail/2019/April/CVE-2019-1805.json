{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1805", "Description": "A vulnerability in certain access control mechanisms for the Secure Shell (SSH) server implementation for Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to access a CLI instance on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input- and validation-checking mechanisms for inbound SSH connections on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to establish an SSH connection to an affected controller. An exploit could allow the attacker to access an affected device's CLI to potentially cause further attacks. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 8.5(140.0).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1805", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller Software\u00bbVersion:8.3(141.0)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:8.3\\(141.0\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-07  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-wlc-ssh", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Secure Shell Unauthorized Access VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108003", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller CVE-2019-1805 Unauthorized Access VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
