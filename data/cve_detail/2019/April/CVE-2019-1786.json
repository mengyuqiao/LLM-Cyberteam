{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1786", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Portable Document Format (PDF) scanning functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and 0.101.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data handling mechanisms within the device buffer while indexing remaining file data on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted PDF files to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition on an affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1786", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nClamav\u00bbClamav\u00bbVersion:0.101.0cpe:2.3:a:clamav:clamav:0.101.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nClamav\u00bbClamav\u00bbVersion:0.101.1cpe:2.3:a:clamav:clamav:0.101.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.34%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-04-01  0.21%  0.29%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.21%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=12149", "ref_desc": "12149 - clamav/clamav_scanfile_PDF_fuzzer: Crash in pdf_nextobject - oss-fuzz - MonorailIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201904-12", "ref_desc": "ClamAV: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201904-12) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U_nUK6kCtdpgK5yGvjYfkZI5Xts.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=12168", "ref_desc": "12168 - clamav/clamav_scanfile_PDF_fuzzer: Heap-buffer-overflow in pdf_parseobj - oss-fuzz - MonorailIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
