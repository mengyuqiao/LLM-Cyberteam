{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10842", "Description": "Arbitrary code execution (via backdoor code) was discovered in bootstrap-sass 3.2.0.3, when downloaded from rubygems.org. An unauthenticated attacker can craft the ___cfduid cookie value with base64 arbitrary code to be executed via eval(), which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the target system. Note that there are three underscore characters in the cookie name. This is unrelated to the __cfduid cookie that is legitimately used by Cloudflare.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10842", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGetbootstrap\u00bbBootstrap-sass\u00bbVersion:3.2.0.3ForRubycpe:2.3:a:getbootstrap:bootstrap-sass:3.2.0.3:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "34.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  44.03%  34.50%  -9.52 \n 2  2024-10-04  46.15%  44.03%  -2.12 \n 3  2024-09-15  60.88%  46.15%  -14.74 \n 4  2024-08-25  70.42%  60.88%  -9.54 \n 5  2024-07-13  75.72%  70.42%  -5.30 \n 6  2024-03-28  78.48%  75.72%  -2.76 \n 7  2024-02-24  81.21%  78.48%  -2.73 \n 8  2023-03-07  2.51%  81.21%  +78.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/1195", "ref_desc": "3.2.0.3? \u00b7 Issue #1195 \u00b7 twbs/bootstrap-sass \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/blog/malicious-remote-code-execution-backdoor-discovered-in-the-popular-bootstrap-sass-ruby-gem/", "ref_desc": "Malicious remote code execution backdoor discovered in the popular bootstrap-sass Ruby gem | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://dgb.github.io/2019/04/05/bootstrap-sass-backdoor.html", "ref_desc": "Bootstrap Sass BackdoorThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-BOOTSTRAPSASS-174093", "ref_desc": "Malicious Package in bootstrap-sass | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
