{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3837", "Description": "It was found that the net_dma code in tcp_recvmsg() in the 2.6.32 kernel as shipped in RHEL6 is thread-unsafe. So an unprivileged multi-threaded userspace application calling recvmsg() for the same network socket in parallel executed on ioatdma-enabled hardware with net_dma enabled can leak the memory, crash the host leading to a denial-of-service or cause a random memory corruption.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3837", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:6.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:2.6.32cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-3837", "ref_desc": "1678423 \u2013 (CVE-2019-3837) CVE-2019-3837 kernel: memory leak in tcp_recvmsg() with NET_DMAIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
