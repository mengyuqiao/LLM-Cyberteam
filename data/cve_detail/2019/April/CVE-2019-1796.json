{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1796", "Description": "A vulnerability in the handling of Inter-Access Point Protocol (IAPP) messages by Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exist because the software improperly validates input on fields within IAPP messages. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious IAPP messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco WLC Software to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Software versions prior to 8.2.170.0, 8.5.150.0, and 8.8.100.0 are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1796", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 8.7.106.0andbefore (<) 8.8.100.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan Controller SoftwareVersions  from including (>=) 8.3.143.0andbefore (<) 8.5.150.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:wireless_lan_controller_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWireless Lan ControllerVersions  before (<) 8.2.170.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:wireless_lan_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-07  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-wlc-iapp", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software IAPP Message Handling Denial of Service VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2ueD6gXFxMvQG_xHSnrcYxi_BRA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108008", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller IAPP Message Handling Multiple Denial of Service VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/e0RlK-GK8nAJStldEhI2W7UJa9c.html"}]}
