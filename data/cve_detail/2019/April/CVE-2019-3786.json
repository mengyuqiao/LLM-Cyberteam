{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3786", "Description": "Cloud Foundry BOSH Backup and Restore CLI, all versions prior to 1.5.0, does not check the authenticity of backup scripts in BOSH. A remote authenticated malicious user can modify the metadata file of a Bosh Backup and Restore job to request extra backup files from different jobs upon restore. The exploited hooks in this metadata script were only maintained in the cfcr-etcd-release, so clusters deployed with the BBR job for etcd in this release are vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3786", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCloudfoundry\u00bbBosh Backup And RestoreVersions  before (<) 1.5.0cpe:2.3:a:cloudfoundry:bosh_backup_and_restore:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.09%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2019-3786", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-3786: BBR could run arbitrary scripts on deployment VMs | Cloud FoundryVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
