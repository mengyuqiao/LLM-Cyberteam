{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10845", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14. When entering new credentials to a site that isn't registered within this product, a pop-up window will appear asking the user if they want to save these new credentials. The code of the pop-up window can be read and, to some extent, manipulated by remote servers. This pop-up window will stay on any page the user visits within the browser until a decision is made. A malicious web server can forcefully manipulate the pop-up and cause it not to appear, stopping users from securing their credentials. This vulnerability is related to id=\"uniqkey-password-popup\" and password-popup/popup.html, but is a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-10676.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10845", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nUniqkey\u00bbPassword Manager\u00bbVersion:1.14cpe:2.3:a:uniqkey:password_manager:1.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.74% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.74%  +0.46 \n 2  2024-08-29  0.31%  0.28%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-04-01  0.26%  0.31%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-09-04  0.29%  0.26%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-05-18  0.22%  0.29%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.22%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Apr/8", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14 - Remote Denial Of Service [CVE-2019-10845]Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152452/Uniqkey-Password-Manager-1.14-Denial-Of-Service.html", "ref_desc": "Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14 Denial Of Service \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://vuldb.com/?id.132960", "ref_desc": "Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14 Credentials denial of serviceThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
