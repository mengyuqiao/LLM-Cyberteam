{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1827", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Online Help web service of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the service. The vulnerability exists because the Online Help web service of an affected device insufficiently validates user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the service to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected service or access sensitive browser-based information.This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running firmware releases prior to 1.4.2.22.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1827", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv320 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.4.2.22cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv320_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv320\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv325 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.4.2.22cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv325_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv325\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.07%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-04-28  0.22%  0.16%  -0.07 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.22%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107776", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers CVE-2019-1827 Cross Site Scripting VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190404-rv-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Online Help Reflected Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
