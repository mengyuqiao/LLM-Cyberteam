{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11072", "Description": "lighttpd before 1.4.54 has a signed integer overflow, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malicious HTTP GET request, as demonstrated by mishandling of /%2F? in burl_normalize_2F_to_slash_fix in burl.c. NOTE: The developer states \"The feature which can be abused to cause the crash is a new feature in lighttpd 1.4.50, and is not enabled by default. It must be explicitly configured in the config file (e.g. lighttpd.conf). Certain input will trigger an abort() in lighttpd when that feature is enabled. lighttpd detects the underflow or realloc() will fail (in both 32-bit and 64-bit executables), also detected in lighttpd. Either triggers an explicit abort() by lighttpd. This is not exploitable beyond triggering the explicit abort() with subsequent application exit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11072", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLighttpd\u00bbLighttpdVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.4.53cpe:2.3:a:lighttpd:lighttpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "36.85% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  66.29%  36.85%  -29.44 \n 2  2024-08-31  72.56%  66.29%  -6.27 \n 3  2024-05-08  77.51%  72.56%  -4.95 \n 4  2024-04-21  87.74%  77.51%  -10.23 \n 5  2024-04-03  86.41%  87.74%  +1.33 \n 6  2024-02-14  90.54%  86.41%  -4.14 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.14%  90.54%  +89.41 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107907", "ref_desc": "lighttpd CVE-2019-11072 Integer Overflow VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2945", "ref_desc": "Bug #2945: Security - SIGABRT during GET request handling with url-path-2f-decode enabled - Lighttpd - lighty labsExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lighttpd/lighttpd1.4/commit/32120d5b8b3203fc21ccb9eafb0eaf824bb59354", "ref_desc": "[core] fix abort in http-parseopts (fixes #2945) \u00b7 lighttpd/lighttpd1.4@32120d5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
