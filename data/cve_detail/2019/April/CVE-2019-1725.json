{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1725", "Description": "A vulnerability in the local management CLI implementation for specific commands on the Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite an arbitrary file on disk. It is also possible the attacker could inject CLI command parameters that should not be allowed for a specific subset of local management CLI commands. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input validation of user input for local management CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing a crafted form of a limited subset of local management CLI commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite an arbitrary files on disk or inject CLI command parameters that should have been disabled. This vulnerability is fixed in software version 4.0(2a) and later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1725", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Computing SystemVersions  before (<) 4.0\\(2a\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_computing_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-ucs-cli-inj", "ref_desc": "Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers Local Management CLI Arbitrary File Creation or CLI Parameter Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108082", "ref_desc": "Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers CVE-2019-1725 Arbitrary File Creation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
