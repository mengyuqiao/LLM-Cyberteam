{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3789", "Description": "Cloud Foundry Routing Release, all versions prior to 0.188.0, contains a vulnerability that can hijack the traffic to route services hosted outside the platform. A user with space developer permissions can create a private domain that shadows the external domain of the route service, and map that route to an app. When the gorouter receives traffic destined for the external route service, this traffic will instead be directed to the internal app using the shadow route.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3789", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCloudfoundry\u00bbRouting ReleaseVersions  before (<) 0.188.0cpe:2.3:a:cloudfoundry:routing_release:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-840", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/840/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2019-3789", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-3789: Gorouter allows space developer to hijack route services hosted outside the platform | Cloud FoundryVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
