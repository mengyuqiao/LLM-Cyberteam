{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9193", "Description": "In PostgreSQL 9.3 through 11.2, the \"COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM\" function allows superusers and users in the 'pg_execute_server_program' group to execute arbitrary code in the context of the database's operating system user. This functionality is enabled by default and can be abused to run arbitrary operating system commands on Windows, Linux, and macOS. NOTE: Third parties claim/state this is not an issue because PostgreSQL functionality for \u2018COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM\u2019 is acting as intended. References state that in PostgreSQL, a superuser can execute commands as the server user without using the \u2018COPY FROM PROGRAM\u2019.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9193", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nPostgresql\u00bbPostgresqlVersions  from including (>=) 9.3andup to, including, (<=) 11.2cpe:2.3:a:postgresql:postgresql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.43%  97.41%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-10-01  97.44%  97.43%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-09-12  97.49%  97.44%  -0.05 \n 4  2024-08-22  97.48%  97.49%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-07-31  97.46%  97.48%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-06-23  97.43%  97.46%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-06-05  97.49%  97.43%  -0.06 \n 8  2024-04-29  97.49%  97.49%  +0.00 \n 9  2024-04-12  97.48%  97.49%  +0.01 \n 10  2024-04-06  97.18%  97.48%  +0.29 \n 11  2024-03-25  97.20%  97.18%  -0.02 \n 12  2024-03-10  97.16%  97.20%  +0.03 \n 13  2024-02-21  97.36%  97.16%  -0.20 \n 14  2024-01-20  97.30%  97.36%  +0.06 \n 15  2023-11-27  97.19%  97.30%  +0.11 \n 16  2023-11-15  97.20%  97.19%  -0.01 \n 17  2023-10-26  97.12%  97.20%  +0.08 \n 18  2023-09-28  97.26%  97.12%  -0.14 \n 19  2023-09-12  97.32%  97.26%  -0.06 \n 20  2023-08-13  97.34%  97.32%  -0.02 \n 21  2023-06-27  97.29%  97.34%  +0.05 \n 22  2023-05-27  97.29%  97.29%  +0.01 \n 23  2023-04-25  97.30%  97.29%  -0.01 \n 24  2023-04-08  97.27%  97.30%  +0.03 \n 25  2023-04-07  97.32%  97.27%  -0.06 \n 26  2023-03-08  97.39%  97.32%  -0.07 \n 27  2023-03-07  88.20%  97.39%  +9.19 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.hagander.net/when-a-vulnerability-is-not-a-vulnerability-244/", "ref_desc": "When a vulnerability is not a vulnerability - Magnus Hagander's blogThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190502-0003/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2019-9193 PostgreSQL in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166540/PostgreSQL-11.7-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "PostgreSQL 11.7 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://medium.com/greenwolf-security/authenticated-arbitrary-command-execution-on-postgresql-9-3-latest-cd18945914d5", "ref_desc": "Authenticated Arbitrary Command Execution on PostgreSQL 9.3 > LatestExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://paquier.xyz/postgresql-2/postgres-9-3-feature-highlight-copy-tofrom-program/", "ref_desc": "Postgres 9.3 feature highlight - COPY TO/FROM PROGRAMThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171722/PostgreSQL-9.6.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "PostgreSQL 9.6.1 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152757/PostgreSQL-COPY-FROM-PROGRAM-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "PostgreSQL COPY FROM PROGRAM Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/authenticated-arbitrary-command-execution-on-postgresql-9-3/", "ref_desc": "Authenticated Arbitrary Command Execution on PostgreSQL 9.3 > Latest | TrustwaveThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
