{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3883", "Description": "In 389-ds-base up to version 1.4.1.2, requests are handled by workers threads. Each sockets will be waited by the worker for at most 'ioblocktimeout' seconds. However this timeout applies only for un-encrypted requests. Connections using SSL/TLS are not taking this timeout into account during reads, and may hang longer.An unauthenticated attacker could repeatedly create hanging LDAP requests to hang all the workers, resulting in a Denial of Service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3883", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:6.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bb389 Directory ServerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.4.1.2cpe:2.3:a:fedoraproject:389_directory_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.47%  4.63%  -0.83 \n 2  2024-12-04  4.30%  5.47%  +1.16 \n 3  2024-09-07  5.97%  4.30%  -1.67 \n 4  2024-06-21  8.20%  5.97%  -2.24 \n 5  2024-04-10  9.74%  8.20%  -1.54 \n 6  2023-08-11  13.09%  9.74%  -3.34 \n 7  2023-05-08  21.75%  13.09%  -8.66 \n 8  2023-04-24  43.87%  21.75%  -22.13 \n 9  2023-03-08  44.78%  43.87%  -0.90 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.11%  44.78%  +43.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/772/Missing-Release-of-Resource-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pagure.io/389-ds-base/issue/50329", "ref_desc": "Issue #50329: Possible Security Issue: DOS due to ioblocktimeout not applying to TLS - 389-ds-base - Pagure.ioIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/05/msg00008.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1779-1] 389-ds-base security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1896", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:1896 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3401", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:3401 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Jn1L6hmZ5uB6Mxx3Q8nhCJRvIhc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00026.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3399-1] 389-ds-base security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/u_QZVlQ5xnmj3DfY2UBvfKQ-Er8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://pagure.io/389-ds-base/pull-request/50331", "ref_desc": "PR#50331: Ticket 50309 - Possible Security Issue: DOS due to ioblocktimeout not applying to TLS - 389-ds-base - Pagure.ioThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-3883", "ref_desc": "1693612 \u2013 (CVE-2019-3883) CVE-2019-3883 389-ds-base: DoS via hanging secured connectionsIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
