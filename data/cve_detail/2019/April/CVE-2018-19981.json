{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-19981", "Description": "Amazon AWS SDK <=2.8.5 for Android uses Android SharedPreferences to store plain text AWS STS Temporary Credentials retrieved by AWS Cognito Identity Service. An attacker can use these credentials to create authenticated and/or authorized requests. Note that the attacker must have \"root\" privilege access to the Android filesystem in order to exploit this vulnerability (i.e. the device has been compromised, such as disabling or bypassing Android's fundamental security mechanisms).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19981", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbAws Software Development Kit\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.8.5cpe:2.3:a:amazon:aws_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.00% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.97%  1.00%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.90%  0.97%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-03-28  0.86%  0.90%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.86%  -0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzodifuccia/cloudflare/master/Images/vulns/aws/aws_sdk_sp_01.png", "ref_desc": "aws_sdk_sp_01.png (1418\u00d7723)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzodifuccia/cloudflare/master/Images/vulns/aws/aws_sdk_sp_03.png", "ref_desc": "aws_sdk_sp_03.png (1317\u00d7535)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://aws-amplify.github.io/aws-sdk-android/docs/reference/com/amazonaws/auth/CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider.html", "ref_desc": "CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider (AWS SDK for Android - 2.14.2)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzodifuccia/cloudflare/master/Images/vulns/aws/aws_sdk_sp_02.png", "ref_desc": "aws_sdk_sp_02.png (1420\u00d7723)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
