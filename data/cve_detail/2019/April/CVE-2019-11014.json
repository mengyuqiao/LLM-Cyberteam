{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11014", "Description": "The VStarCam vstc.vscam.client library and vstc.vscam shared object, as used in the Eye4 application (for Android, iOS, and Windows), do not prevent spoofing of the camera server. An attacker can create a fake camera server that listens for the client looking for a camera on the local network. When the camera responds to the client, it responds via the broadcast address, giving all information necessary to impersonate the camera. The attacker then floods the client with responses, causing the original camera to be denied service from the client, and thus causing the client to then communicate exclusively with the attacker's fake camera server. When connecting to the fake camera server, the client sends all details necessary to login to the camera (username and password).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11014", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nVstarcam\u00bbEye4\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:vstarcam:eye4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.69%  0.97%  +0.28 \n 2  2024-08-29  0.81%  0.69%  -0.12 \n 3  2023-03-15  0.80%  0.81%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.80%  -0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://blog.0x42424242.in/2019/03/vstarcam-investigational-security.html", "ref_desc": "VStarCam - An Investigative Security Journey - Part 1Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://blog.0x42424242.in/2019/03/vstarcam-investigational-security_22.html", "ref_desc": "VStarCam - An Investigative Security Journey - Part 2Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
