{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1712", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the PIM process to restart, resulting in a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of crafted AutoRP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to port UDP 496 on a reachable IP address on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the PIM process to restart. Software versions prior to 6.2.3, 6.3.2, 6.4.0, and 6.5.1 are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1712", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.1andbefore (<) 6.5.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 6.3.3andbefore (<) 6.4.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  before (<) 6.2.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XrVersions  from including (>=) 6.2.25andbefore (<) 6.3.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-09-07  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-iosxr-pim-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software Protocol Independent Multicast Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108025", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XR Software CVE-2019-1712 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
