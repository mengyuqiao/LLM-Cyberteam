{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9383", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url \"/port_3480\". It seems that the UPnP services provide \"wget\" as one of the service actions for a normal user to connect the device to an external website. It retrieves the parameter \"URL\" from the query string and then passes it to an internal function that uses the curl module on the device to retrieve the contents of the website.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9383", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGetvera\u00bbVeraedge FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.19cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veraedge_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeraedge\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGetvera\u00bbVeralite FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.481cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veralite_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeralite\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.45%  1.45%  -1.00 \n 2  2024-11-07  3.48%  2.45%  -1.03 \n 3  2024-06-28  1.77%  3.48%  +1.71 \n 4  2024-06-10  1.75%  1.77%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-06  1.31%  1.75%  +0.44 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  1.31%  +0.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153242/Veralite-Veraedge-Router-XSS-Command-Injection-CSRF-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Veralite / Veraedge Router XSS / Command Injection / CSRF / Traversal \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hdJusa7ybqBtroBWbHUvLs2lqGs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Vera_sec_issues.pdf", "ref_desc": "IoT_vulnerabilities/Vera_sec_issues.pdf at master \u00b7 ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yuptkwxI_AmzeWn_iFXSeacPbxM.html"}]}
