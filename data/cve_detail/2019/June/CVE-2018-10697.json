{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10697", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 devices. The Moxa AWK 3121 provides ping functionality so that an administrator can execute ICMP calls to check if the network is working correctly. However, the same functionality allows an attacker to execute commands on the device. The POST parameter \"srvName\" is susceptible to this injection. By crafting a packet that contains shell metacharacters, it is possible for an attacker to execute the attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10697", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMoxa\u00bbAwk-3121 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.14cpe:2.3:o:moxa:awk-3121_firmware:1.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Moxa\u00bbAwk-3121\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.89%  0.93%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-11-18  0.77%  0.89%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-10-28  0.78%  0.77%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-10-06  0.74%  0.78%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-09-15  0.93%  0.74%  -0.20 \n 6  2024-07-05  0.84%  0.93%  +0.09 \n 7  2024-06-18  0.66%  0.84%  +0.19 \n 8  2024-05-31  0.65%  0.66%  +0.01 \n 9  2024-03-07  0.73%  0.65%  -0.08 \n 10  2024-02-02  0.69%  0.73%  +0.05 \n 11  2024-01-01  0.62%  0.69%  +0.06 \n 12  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.62%  -0.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/samuelhuntley/Moxa_AWK_1121/blob/master/Moxa_AWK_1121", "ref_desc": "Moxa_AWK_1121/Moxa_AWK_1121 at master \u00b7 samuelhuntley/Moxa_AWK_1121 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oh5_HgweBz0DUljhTdZ-tsfMNjk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153223/Moxa-AWK-3121-1.14-Information-Disclosure-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 Information Disclosure / Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QIZTeD82-zY_aJoeom9EUWaECi0.html"}]}
