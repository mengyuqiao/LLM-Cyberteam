{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12760", "Description": "A deserialization vulnerability exists in the way parso through 0.4.0 handles grammar parsing from the cache. Cache loading relies on pickle and, provided that an evil pickle can be written to a cache grammar file and that its parsing can be triggered, this flaw leads to Arbitrary Code Execution. NOTE: This is disputed because \"the cache directory is not under control of the attacker in any common configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12760", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nParso Project\u00bbParsoVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.4.0cpe:2.3:a:parso_project:parso:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.22%  +0.08 \n 2  2023-03-07  2.28%  0.13%  -2.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/dhondta/f71ae7e5c4234f8edfd2f12503a5dcc7", "ref_desc": "Proof-of-Concept for Python parso Cache Load Vulnerability \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/davidhalter/parso/issues/75", "ref_desc": "Deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-12760) \u00b7 Issue #75 \u00b7 davidhalter/parso \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
