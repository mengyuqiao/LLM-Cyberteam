{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9039", "Description": "In Couchbase Sync Gateway 2.1.2, an attacker with access to the Sync Gateway\u2019s public REST API was able to issue additional N1QL statements and extract sensitive data or call arbitrary N1QL functions through the parameters \"startkey\" and \"endkey\" on the \"_all_docs\" endpoint. By issuing nested queries with CPU-intensive operations they may have been able to cause increased resource usage and denial of service conditions. The _all_docs endpoint is not required for Couchbase Mobile replication and external access to this REST endpoint has been blocked to mitigate this issue. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.5.0 and 2.1.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9039", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCouchbase\u00bbSync Gateway\u00bbVersion:2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:couchbase:sync_gateway:2.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.65% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.50%  0.65%  +0.15 \n 2  2024-06-19  0.42%  0.50%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.42%  -0.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.couchbase.com/resources/security#SecurityAlerts", "ref_desc": "Enterprise-Level Security | CouchbaseCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0wuAKaJW6IaJNfEXpyVp6fcL8wU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/2.5/release-notes.html", "ref_desc": "Release Notes | Couchbase DocsRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.hisolutions.com/2019/06/n1ql-injection-in-couchbase-sync-gateway-cve-2019-9039/", "ref_desc": "N1QL Injection in Couchbase Sync Gateway - CVE-2019-9039 \u2013 HiSolutions ResearchExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
