{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10694", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 devices. The device provides a Wi-Fi connection that is open and does not use any encryption mechanism by default. An administrator who uses the open wireless connection to set up the device can allow an attacker to sniff the traffic passing between the user's computer and the device. This can allow an attacker to steal the credentials passing over the HTTP connection as well as TELNET traffic. Also an attacker can MITM the response and infect a user's computer very easily as well.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10694", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMoxa\u00bbAwk-3121 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.14cpe:2.3:o:moxa:awk-3121_firmware:1.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Moxa\u00bbAwk-3121\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.20%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-18  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-10-28  0.20%  0.19%  0.00 \n 4  2024-10-06  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-09-15  0.24%  0.19%  -0.05 \n 6  2024-07-05  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-06-18  0.17%  0.21%  +0.05 \n 8  2024-05-31  0.16%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 9  2024-02-02  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.17%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/samuelhuntley/Moxa_AWK_1121/blob/master/Moxa_AWK_1121", "ref_desc": "Moxa_AWK_1121/Moxa_AWK_1121 at master \u00b7 samuelhuntley/Moxa_AWK_1121 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oh5_HgweBz0DUljhTdZ-tsfMNjk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153223/Moxa-AWK-3121-1.14-Information-Disclosure-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 Information Disclosure / Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QIZTeD82-zY_aJoeom9EUWaECi0.html"}]}
