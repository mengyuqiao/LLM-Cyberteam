{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8337", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a user with the capability of executing various actions on the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any Origin header check which allows an attacker who can trick a user to navigate to an attacker's webpage to exploit this issue and brute force the password for the web management interface. It also allows an attacker to then execute any other actions which include management if rules, sensors attached to the devices using the websocket requests.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8337", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSecurifi\u00bbAlmond Firmware\u00bbVersion:Al-r096cpe:2.3:o:securifi:almond_firmware:al-r096:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Securifi\u00bbAlmond\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSecurifi\u00bbAlmond 2015 Firmware\u00bbVersion:Al-r096cpe:2.3:o:securifi:almond_2015_firmware:al-r096:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Securifi\u00bbAlmond 2015\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSecurifi\u00bbAlmond+firmware\u00bbVersion:Al-r096cpe:2.3:o:securifi:almond\\+firmware:al-r096:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Securifi\u00bbAlmond+\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "3.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.26%  3.47%  +2.20 \n 2  2024-11-08  1.28%  1.26%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-08-04  1.81%  1.28%  -0.53 \n 4  2024-07-16  1.30%  1.81%  +0.51 \n 5  2024-06-29  0.91%  1.30%  +0.39 \n 6  2024-06-11  0.90%  0.91%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-11-14  1.00%  0.90%  -0.10 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  1.00%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153227/Securifi-Almond-2015-Buffer-Overflow-Command-Injection-XSS-CSRF.html", "ref_desc": "Securifi Almond 2015 Buffer Overflow / Command Injection / XSS / CSRF \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B_pcyOJs1y82psb6QTMwE63i8Aw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Securifi_Almond_plus_sec_issues.pdf", "ref_desc": "IoT_vulnerabilities/Securifi_Almond_plus_sec_issues.pdf at master \u00b7 ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TWYyjHZ2xXBJN0VOfoHRyPA1p0k.html"}]}
