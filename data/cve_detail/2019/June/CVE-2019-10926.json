{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10926", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC MV400 family (All Versions < V7.0.6). Communication with the device is not encrypted. Data transmitted between the device and the user can be obtained by an attacker in a privileged network position. The security vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position which allows eavesdropping the communication between the affected device and the user. The user must invoke a session. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability compromises confidentiality of the data transmitted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10926", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbSimatic Mv420 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:siemens:simatic_mv420_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbSimatic Mv420\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSiemens\u00bbSimatic Mv440 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:siemens:simatic_mv440_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbSimatic Mv440\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.15%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-11-02  0.25%  0.19%  -0.06 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.28%  0.25%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-07-22  0.29%  0.28%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-04-16  0.21%  0.29%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-04-01  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.17%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-310", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/310/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-816980.pdf", "ref_desc": "Mitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_W6l815n4dlEfA6vCOgP_Zoiabw.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108725", "ref_desc": "Siemens SIMATIC Ident MV420 and MV440 Families Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oiutwfiXl6Qy5dSM56iUvuxkFo8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-162-02", "ref_desc": "Siemens SIMATIC Ident MV420 and MV440 Families | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Oo3JEDKaLCc7EBF2BG0ol0oFtC4.html"}]}
