{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8332", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a user with the capability of blocking key words passing in the web traffic to prevent kids from watching content that might be deemed unsafe using the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site scripting protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who is logged in to the web management interface into executing a stored cross-site scripting payload on the user's browser and execute any action on the device provided by the web management interface.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8332", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSecurifi\u00bbAlmond Firmware\u00bbVersion:Al-r096cpe:2.3:o:securifi:almond_firmware:al-r096:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Securifi\u00bbAlmond\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSecurifi\u00bbAlmond 2015 Firmware\u00bbVersion:Al-r096cpe:2.3:o:securifi:almond_2015_firmware:al-r096:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Securifi\u00bbAlmond 2015\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSecurifi\u00bbAlmond+firmware\u00bbVersion:Al-r096cpe:2.3:o:securifi:almond\\+firmware:al-r096:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Securifi\u00bbAlmond+\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.59% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.00%  0.59%  -0.41 \n 2  2024-11-08  1.22%  1.00%  -0.22 \n 3  2024-10-17  2.42%  1.22%  -1.20 \n 4  2024-06-29  3.38%  2.42%  -0.97 \n 5  2024-06-11  3.36%  3.38%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-02-13  3.57%  3.36%  -0.21 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  3.57%  +2.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153227/Securifi-Almond-2015-Buffer-Overflow-Command-Injection-XSS-CSRF.html", "ref_desc": "Securifi Almond 2015 Buffer Overflow / Command Injection / XSS / CSRF \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B_pcyOJs1y82psb6QTMwE63i8Aw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Securifi_Almond_plus_sec_issues.pdf", "ref_desc": "IoT_vulnerabilities/Securifi_Almond_plus_sec_issues.pdf at master \u00b7 ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TWYyjHZ2xXBJN0VOfoHRyPA1p0k.html"}]}
