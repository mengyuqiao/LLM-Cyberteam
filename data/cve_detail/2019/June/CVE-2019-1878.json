{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1878", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) implementation for the Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands that are executed by the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received CDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands or scripts on the targeted device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1878", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence TcVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.3.17cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_tc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence CeVersions  from including (>=) 9.6.0andbefore (<) 9.6.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_ce:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence CeVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.0andbefore (<) 9.5.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_ce:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence CeVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.3.7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_ce:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2024-11-10  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108883", "ref_desc": "Cisco TelePresence Endpoint CVE-2019-1878 Command Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-tele-shell-inj", "ref_desc": "Cisco TelePresence Endpoint Command Shell Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
