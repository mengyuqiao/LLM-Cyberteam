{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3875", "Description": "A vulnerability was found in keycloak before 6.0.2. The X.509 authenticator supports the verification of client certificates through the CRL, where the CRL list can be obtained from the URL provided in the certificate itself (CDP) or through the separately configured path. The CRL are often available over the network through unsecured protocols ('http' or 'ldap') and hence the caller should verify the signature and possibly the certification path. Keycloak currently doesn't validate signatures on CRL, which can result in a possibility of various attacks like man-in-the-middle.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3875", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbKeycloakVersions  before (<) 6.0.2cpe:2.3:a:redhat:keycloak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbSingle Sign-on\u00bbVersion:7.3cpe:2.3:a:redhat:single_sign-on:7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-11-02  0.08%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108748", "ref_desc": "keycloak CVE-2019-3875 Man in the Middle Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-3875", "ref_desc": "1690628 \u2013 (CVE-2019-3875) CVE-2019-3875 keycloak: missing signatures validation on CRL used to verify client certificatesIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
