{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18406", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Tufin SecureTrack 18.1 with TufinOS 2.16 build 1179(Final). The Audit Report module is affected by a blind XXE vulnerability when a new Best Practices Report is saved using a special payload inside the xml input field. The XXE vulnerability is blind since the response doesn't directly display a requested file, but rather returns it inside the name data field when the report is saved. An attacker is able to view restricted operating system files. This issue affects all types of users: administrators or normal users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18406", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nTufin\u00bbSecuretrack\u00bbVersion:18.1cpe:2.3:a:tufin:securetrack:18.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Tufin\u00bbTufinos\u00bbVersion:2.16UpdateBuild 1179", "EPSS Score": "5.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.52%  5.38%  +3.87 \n 2  2024-08-05  1.81%  1.52%  -0.29 \n 3  2024-06-30  2.11%  1.81%  -0.30 \n 4  2024-06-12  2.09%  2.11%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-05-10  1.81%  2.09%  +0.29 \n 6  2024-04-08  1.96%  1.81%  -0.15 \n 7  2024-02-14  1.87%  1.96%  +0.09 \n 8  2023-04-08  1.74%  1.87%  +0.13 \n 9  2023-03-07  7.31%  1.74%  -5.57 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://forum.tufin.com/support/kc/latest/", "ref_desc": "Tufin Knowledge Center R19-1Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45808", "ref_desc": "TufinOS 2.17 Build 1193 - XML External Entity InjectionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.tufin.com/", "ref_desc": "Network Security Policy Management, Firewall Management | TufinVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
