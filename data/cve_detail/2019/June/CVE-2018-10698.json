{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-10698", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 devices. The device enables an unencrypted TELNET service by default. This allows an attacker who has been able to gain an MITM position to easily sniff the traffic between the device and the user. Also an attacker can easily connect to the TELNET daemon using the default credentials if they have not been changed by the user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10698", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMoxa\u00bbAwk-3121 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.14cpe:2.3:o:moxa:awk-3121_firmware:1.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Moxa\u00bbAwk-3121\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.45%  0.20%  -0.25 \n 2  2024-11-18  0.39%  0.45%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-10-28  0.56%  0.39%  -0.17 \n 4  2024-10-06  1.06%  0.56%  -0.50 \n 5  2024-09-15  1.35%  1.06%  -0.29 \n 6  2024-07-05  1.71%  1.35%  -0.36 \n 7  2024-06-18  2.65%  1.71%  -0.94 \n 8  2024-05-31  2.63%  2.65%  +0.02 \n 9  2024-02-02  2.79%  2.63%  -0.17 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  2.79%  +1.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/samuelhuntley/Moxa_AWK_1121/blob/master/Moxa_AWK_1121", "ref_desc": "Moxa_AWK_1121/Moxa_AWK_1121 at master \u00b7 samuelhuntley/Moxa_AWK_1121 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oh5_HgweBz0DUljhTdZ-tsfMNjk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153223/Moxa-AWK-3121-1.14-Information-Disclosure-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 Information Disclosure / Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QIZTeD82-zY_aJoeom9EUWaECi0.html"}]}
