{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1845", "Description": "A vulnerability in the authentication service of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence (Unified CM IM&amp;P) Service, Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS), and Cisco Expressway Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a service outage for users attempting to authenticate, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient controls for specific memory operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) authentication request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the authentication service, preventing users from successfully authenticating. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not impact users who were authenticated prior to an attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1845", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager Im And Presence Service\u00bbVersion:11.5(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager_im_and_presence_service:11.5\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Video Communication ServerVersions  from including (>=) x8.1andup to, including, (<=) x12.5.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_video_communication_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-10-26  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108615", "ref_desc": "Multiple Cisco Products CVE-2019-1845 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-cucm-imp-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM&P Service, Cisco TelePresence VCS, and Cisco Expressway Series Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
