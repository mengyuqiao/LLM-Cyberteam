{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9381", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a user with the capability of installing or deleting apps on the device using the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site request forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who navigates to an attacker controlled page to install or delete an application on the device. Note: The cross-site request forgery is a systemic issue across all other functionalities of the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9381", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nGetvera\u00bbVeraedge FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.19cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veraedge_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeraedge\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGetvera\u00bbVeralite FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.481cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veralite_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeralite\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  1.56%  +1.17 \n 2  2024-11-07  0.40%  0.39%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-06-10  0.39%  0.40%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-13  0.44%  0.39%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.44%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153242/Veralite-Veraedge-Router-XSS-Command-Injection-CSRF-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Veralite / Veraedge Router XSS / Command Injection / CSRF / Traversal \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hdJusa7ybqBtroBWbHUvLs2lqGs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Vera_sec_issues.pdf", "ref_desc": "IoT_vulnerabilities/Vera_sec_issues.pdf at master \u00b7 ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yuptkwxI_AmzeWn_iFXSeacPbxM.html"}]}
