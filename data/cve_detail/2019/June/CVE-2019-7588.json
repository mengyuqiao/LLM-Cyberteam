{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7588", "Description": "A vulnerability in the exacqVision Enterprise System Manager (ESM) v5.12.2 application whereby unauthorized privilege escalation can potentially be achieved. This vulnerability impacts exacqVision ESM v5.12.2 and all prior versions of ESM running on a Windows operating system. This issue does not impact any Windows Server OSs, or Linux deployments with permissions that are not inherited from the root directory. Authorized Users have \u2018modify\u2019 permission to the ESM folders, which allows a low privilege account to modify files located in these directories. An executable can be renamed and replaced by a malicious file that could connect back to a bad actor providing system level privileges. A low privileged user is not able to restart the service, but a restart of the system would trigger the execution of the malicious file. This issue affects: Exacq Technologies, Inc. exacqVision Enterprise System Manager (ESM) Version 5.12.2 and prior versions; This issue does not affect: Exacq Technologies, Inc. exacqVision Enterprise System Manager (ESM) 19.03 and above.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7588", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nExacq\u00bbEnterprise System ManagerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.12.2cpe:2.3:a:exacq:enterprise_system_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-08  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-06  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.37%  0.11%  -1.25 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/-/media/jci/be/united-states/specialty-pages/product-security/files/cpp-psa-2019-01-v2-exacqvision-esm.pdf", "ref_desc": "Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://exacq.com/kb?crc=31399", "ref_desc": "Knowledge Base | Exacq from Tyco Security ProductsMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/151691/exacqvisionesm5122-escalate.txt", "ref_desc": "exacqVision ESM 5.12.2 Privilege Escalation \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-164-01", "ref_desc": "Johnson Controls exacqVision Enterprise System Manager | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government Resource", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
