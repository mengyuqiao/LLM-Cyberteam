{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1879", "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input at the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with the administrator password via the CLI of an affected device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1879", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIntegrated Management Controller\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:integrated_management_controller:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Computing System\u00bbVersion:4.0(1c)hs3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_computing_system:4.0\\(1c\\)hs3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-cimc-cli-cmdinj", "ref_desc": "Cisco Integrated Management Controller CLI Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108850", "ref_desc": "Cisco Integrated Management Controller CVE-2019-1879 Local Command Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
