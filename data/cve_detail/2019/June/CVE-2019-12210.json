{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12210", "Description": "In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is set using debug_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12210", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nYubico\u00bbPam-u2f\u00bbVersion:1.0.7cpe:2.3:a:yubico:pam-u2f:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.31%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-10-25  0.20%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-05-28  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.16%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f/commit/18b1914e32b74ff52000f10e97067e841e5fff62", "ref_desc": "Do not leak file descriptor when doing exec \u00b7 Yubico/pam-u2f@18b1914 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developers.yubico.com/pam-u2f/Release_Notes.html", "ref_desc": "Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KTP6_FCn107CI-m4J8k5z92tJ5w.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00012.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2019:1708-1: moderate: Security update fCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NNy-EAn82flzbbEKZcYwMi06ef0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00018.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2019:1725-1: moderate: Security update fCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/S-QcfIiCdX9cbWDESLO-ntdiq7M.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/05/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - pam-u2f: CVE-2019-12210: debug_file file descriptor leak, CVE-2019-12209: symlink attack on u2f_keys leading to possible information leakMailing List;Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xdZROi3LoAuq6nlKZTMKBuNM9r0.html"}]}
