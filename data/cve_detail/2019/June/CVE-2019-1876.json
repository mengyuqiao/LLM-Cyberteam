{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1876", "Description": "A vulnerability in the HTTPS proxy feature of Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to use the Central Manager as an HTTPS proxy. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication of proxy connection requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTPS CONNECT message to the Central Manager. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access public internet resources that would normally be blocked by corporate policies.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1876", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWide Area Application Services\u00bbVersion:6.1(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:wide_area_application_services:6.1\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWide Area Application Services\u00bbVersion:5.5(7)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:wide_area_application_services:5.5\\(7\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWide Area Application Services\u00bbVersion:6.4(3b)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:wide_area_application_services:6.4\\(3b\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-11-10  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.13%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-waas-authbypass", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software HTTPS Proxy Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108863", "ref_desc": "Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software CVE-2019-1876 Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
