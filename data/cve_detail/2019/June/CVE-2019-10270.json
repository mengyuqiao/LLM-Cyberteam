{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-10270", "Description": "An arbitrary password reset issue was discovered in the Ultimate Member plugin 2.39 for WordPress. It is possible (due to lack of verification and correlation between the reset password key sent by mail and the user_id parameter) to reset the password of another user. One only needs to know the user_id, which is publicly available. One just has to intercept the password modification request and modify user_id. It is possible to modify the passwords for any users or admin WordPress Ultimate Members. This could lead to account compromise and privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10270", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nUltimatemember\u00bbUltimate Member\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.0.40cpe:2.3:a:ultimatemember:ultimate_member:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2019060101", "ref_desc": "Ultimate Member 2.39 Arbitrary password reset - CXSecurity.comExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
