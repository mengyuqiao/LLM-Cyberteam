{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12928", "Description": "The QMP migrate command in QEMU version 4.0.0 and earlier is vulnerable to OS command injection, which allows the remote attacker to achieve code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure by sending a crafted QMP command to the listening server. Note: This has been disputed as a non-issue since QEMU's -qmp interface is meant to be used by trusted users. If one is able to access this interface via a tcp socket open to the internet, then it is an insecure configuration issue", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12928", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nQemu\u00bbQemuVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:a:qemu:qemu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.65% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.52%  0.65%  +0.13 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.52%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://fakhrizulkifli.github.io/posts/2019/06/05/CVE-2019-12928/", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2019-12928] QEMU Machine Protocol Migrate Command Execution | Fakhri ZulkifliExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
