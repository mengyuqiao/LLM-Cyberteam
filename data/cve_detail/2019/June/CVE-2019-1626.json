The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly authorize certain user actions in the device configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the vManage Web UI and sending crafted HTTP requests to vManage. A successful exploit could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges and make changes to the configuration that they would not normally be authorized to make.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1626", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 18.3.6cpe:2.3:o:cisco:sd-wan_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge-100\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge-1000\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge-100b\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge-2000\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge-5000\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge 100m\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVedge 100wm\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.09%  -0.12 \n 2  2023-07-29  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108838", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN Solution CVE-2019-1626 Remote Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-sdwan-privilescal", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN Solution Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
