{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9386", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a script file called \"get_file.sh\" which allows a user to retrieve any file stored in the \"cmh-ext\" folder on the device. However, the \"filename\" parameter is not validated correctly and this allows an attacker to directory traverse outside the /cmh-ext folder and read any file on the device. It is necessary to create the folder \"cmh-ext\" on the device which can be executed by an attacker first in an unauthenticated fashion and then execute a directory traversal attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9386", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGetvera\u00bbVeraedge FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.19cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veraedge_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeraedge\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGetvera\u00bbVeralite FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.481cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veralite_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeralite\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.20%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-07  0.28%  0.24%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-10-16  0.57%  0.28%  -0.29 \n 4  2024-06-28  0.81%  0.57%  -0.24 \n 5  2024-06-10  0.92%  0.81%  -0.11 \n 6  2024-05-26  1.13%  0.92%  -0.21 \n 7  2024-02-12  1.21%  1.13%  -0.07 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  1.21%  +0.32 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153242/Veralite-Veraedge-Router-XSS-Command-Injection-CSRF-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Veralite / Veraedge Router XSS / Command Injection / CSRF / Traversal \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hdJusa7ybqBtroBWbHUvLs2lqGs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Vera_sec_issues.pdf", "ref_desc": "IoT_vulnerabilities/Vera_sec_issues.pdf at master \u00b7 ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yuptkwxI_AmzeWn_iFXSeacPbxM.html"}]}
