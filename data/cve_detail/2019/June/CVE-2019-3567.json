{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3567", "Description": "In some configurations an attacker can inject a new executable path into the extensions.load file for osquery and hard link a parent folder of a malicious binary to a folder with known 'safe' permissions. Under those circumstances osquery will load said malicious executable with SYSTEM permissions. The solution is to migrate installations to the 'Program Files' directory on Windows which restricts unprivileged write access. This issue affects osquery prior to v3.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3567", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbOsqueryVersions  before (<) 3.4.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:osquery:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2019-3567", "ref_desc": "FacebookThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
