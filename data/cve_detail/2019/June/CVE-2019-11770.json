{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11770", "Description": "In Eclipse Buildship versions prior to 3.1.1, the build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Any of these artifacts could have been MITM to maliciously compromise them and infect the build artifacts that were produced. Additionally, if any of these JARs or other dependencies were compromised, any developers using these could continue to be infected past updating to fix this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11770", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbBuildshipVersions  before (<) 3.1.1cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:buildship:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.25%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-669 Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/669/Incorrect-Resource-Transfer-Between-Spheres.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/issues/855", "ref_desc": "Releases should not depend on insecure or untrusted code \u00b7 Issue #855 \u00b7 eclipse/buildship \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=547734", "ref_desc": "547734 \u2013 (CVE-2019-11770) Eclipse Buildship: New CVE RequestVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
