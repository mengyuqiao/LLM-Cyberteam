{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-8320", "Description": "A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.7.6 and later through 3.0.2. Before making new directories or touching files (which now include path-checking code for symlinks), it would delete the target destination. If that destination was hidden behind a symlink, a malicious gem could delete arbitrary files on the user's machine, presuming the attacker could guess at paths. Given how frequently gem is run as sudo, and how predictable paths are on modern systems (/tmp, /usr, etc.), this could likely lead to data loss or an unusable system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-8320", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nRubygems\u00bbRubygemsVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.6andup to, including, (<=) 3.0.2cpe:2.3:a:rubygems:rubygems:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.82% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.61%  0.82%  +0.21 \n 2  2024-05-30  0.49%  0.61%  +0.12 \n 3  2023-03-07  7.18%  0.49%  -6.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1429", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:1429 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.rubygems.org/2019/03/05/security-advisories-2019-03.html", "ref_desc": "March 2019 Security Advisories - RubyGems BlogVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/317321", "ref_desc": "#317321 Delete directory using symlink when decompressing tarExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00036.html", "ref_desc": "[security-announce] openSUSE-SU-2019:1771-1: important: Security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rc1pS0o42rX8Ch9CgCRoAeD7L9Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/08/msg00027.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2330-1] jruby security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zkGEGv8nbINy-6AQTp9gfoPMrvk.html"}]}
