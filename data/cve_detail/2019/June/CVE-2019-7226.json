{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7226", "Description": "The ABB IDAL HTTP server CGI interface contains a URL that allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to privileged functions. Specifically, /cgi/loginDefaultUser creates a session in an authenticated state and returns the session ID along with what may be the username and cleartext password of the user. An attacker can then supply an IDALToken value in a cookie, which will allow them to perform privileged operations such as restarting the service with /cgi/restart. A GET request to /cgi/loginDefaultUser may result in \"1 #S_OK IDALToken=532c8632b86694f0232a68a0897a145c admin admin\" or a similar response.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7226", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nABB\u00bbPb610 Panel Builder 600 FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 1.91andup to, including, (<=) 2.8.0.367cpe:2.3:o:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:ABB\u00bbPb610 Panel Builder 600\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.17%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-17  0.25%  0.20%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-07-25  0.36%  0.25%  -0.11 \n 4  2024-06-20  0.32%  0.36%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-05-18  0.30%  0.32%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-09-06  0.33%  0.30%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-08-06  0.29%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-07-04  0.36%  0.29%  -0.07 \n 9  2023-06-03  0.29%  0.36%  +0.07 \n 10  2023-05-01  0.32%  0.29%  -0.03 \n 11  2023-03-29  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.28%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jun/39", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: XL-19-010 - ABB IDAL HTTP Server Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/abb-idal-http-server-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-xl-19-010/", "ref_desc": "DarkMatter - Smart and Safe Digital | ABB IDAL HTTP Server Authentication BypassExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153402/ABB-IDAL-HTTP-Server-Authentication-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "ABB IDAL HTTP Server Authentication Bypass \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108886", "ref_desc": "ABB PB610 Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YjQpw0WKwioJ_mx8gCDy0GDGYE4.html"}]}
