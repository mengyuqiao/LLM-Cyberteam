{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-15913", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Cloudera Manager 5.x through 5.15.0. One type of page in Cloudera Manager uses a 'returnUrl' parameter to redirect the user to another page in Cloudera Manager once a wizard is completed. The validity of this parameter was not checked. As a result, the user could be automatically redirected to an attacker's external site or perform a malicious JavaScript function that results in cross-site scripting (XSS). This was fixed by not allowing any value in the returnUrl parameter with patterns such as http://, https://, //, or javascript. The only exceptions to this rule are the SAML Login/Logout URLs, which remain supported since they are explicitly configured and they are not passed via the returnUrl parameter.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15913", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCloudera\u00bbCloudera ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.15.0cpe:2.3:a:cloudera:cloudera_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/security-bulletins/topics/Security-Bulletin.html", "ref_desc": "Cloudera Security Bulletins | 5.x | Cloudera DocumentationVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TJzR8gIyHBzUolFIWyVlCL9nXJw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/security-bulletins/topics/Security-Bulletin.html#cloudera_manager", "ref_desc": "Cloudera Security Bulletins | 5.x | Cloudera DocumentationVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wJpGxzrYaglmVM8N-HGrQbkuGcA.html"}]}
