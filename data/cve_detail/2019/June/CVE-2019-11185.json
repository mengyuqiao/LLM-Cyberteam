{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-11185", "Description": "The WP Live Chat Support Pro plugin through 8.0.26 for WordPress contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. This results from an incomplete patch for CVE-2018-12426. Arbitrary file upload is achieved by using a non-blacklisted executable file extension in conjunction with a whitelisted file extension, and prepending \"magic bytes\" to the payload to pass MIME checks. Specifically, an unauthenticated remote user submits a crafted file upload POST request to the REST api remote_upload endpoint. The file contains data that will fool the plugin's MIME check into classifying it as an image (which is a whitelisted file extension) and finally a trailing .phtml file extension.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11185", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\n3CX\u00bbLive Chat\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 8.0.26cpe:2.3:a:3cx:live_chat:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.87% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.53%  1.87%  +0.35 \n 2  2024-10-24  1.79%  1.53%  -0.27 \n 3  2024-09-11  1.78%  1.79%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-27  1.56%  1.78%  +0.22 \n 5  2024-01-17  2.01%  1.56%  -0.45 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.14%  2.01%  +0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9320", "ref_desc": "WP Live Chat Support Pro - File Upload BypassExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-live-chat-support/#developers", "ref_desc": "WP Live Chat Support \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.orgThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lPADag6i8qbxZTzvlxjRFOqGGn4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wp-livechat.com/", "ref_desc": "Home - WP Live Chat SupportVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
