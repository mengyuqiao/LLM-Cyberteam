{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-10718", "Description": "Recently it was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in the most recent firmware for Shekar Endoscope that any malicious user connecting to the device can change the default SSID and password thereby denying the owner an access to his/her own device. This device acts as an Endoscope camera that allows its users to use it in various industrial systems and settings, car garages, and also in some cases in the medical clinics to get access to areas that are difficult for a human being to reach. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get access to video feed and pictures viewed by that user and might allow them to get a foot hold in air gapped networks especially in case of nation critical infrastructure/industries.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-10718", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIshekar\u00bbEndoscope Camera Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:ishekar:endoscope_camera_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Ishekar\u00bbEndoscope Camera\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.10%  -0.08 \n 2  2024-11-07  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-28  0.26%  0.18%  -0.08 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-22  0.26%  0.25%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.26%  -0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-255", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/255/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153241/Shekar-Endoscope-Weak-Default-Settings-Memory-Corruption.html", "ref_desc": "Shekar Endoscope Weak Default Settings / Memory Corruption \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1juojKN07niPhN5TE-x2MP6eXbc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Shekar_boriscope_sec_issues.pdf", "ref_desc": "IoT_vulnerabilities/Shekar_boriscope_sec_issues.pdf at master \u00b7 ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bVabLj09vOoi2KDfU9stwb8iEtM.html"}]}
