{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7232", "Description": "The ABB IDAL HTTP server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when a long Host header is sent in a web request. The Host header value overflows a buffer and overwrites a Structured Exception Handler (SEH) address. An unauthenticated attacker can submit a Host header value of 2047 bytes or more to overflow the buffer and overwrite the SEH address, which can then be leveraged to execute attacker-controlled code on the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7232", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nABB\u00bbPb610 Panel Builder 600 FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 1.91andup to, including, (<=) 2.8.0.367cpe:2.3:o:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:ABB\u00bbPb610 Panel Builder 600\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.42%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-11-14  0.64%  0.42%  -0.22 \n 3  2024-10-02  0.90%  0.64%  -0.26 \n 4  2024-08-10  1.27%  0.90%  -0.37 \n 5  2024-07-22  1.77%  1.27%  -0.51 \n 6  2024-06-17  2.20%  1.77%  -0.42 \n 7  2023-11-05  2.83%  2.20%  -0.64 \n 8  2023-08-19  2.94%  2.83%  -0.11 \n 9  2023-05-31  2.59%  2.94%  +0.36 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.11%  2.59%  +1.48 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/published-advisories/", "ref_desc": "DarkMatter - Smart and Safe Digital | xen1thLabs advisoriesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1gayumvbNbM_5M6AlnhvWbh4ZaA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3ADR010377&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch", "ref_desc": "Mitigation;Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9PvPBzFEG-QmhgRUXYYficsmcpY.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153403/ABB-IDAL-HTTP-Server-Stack-Based-Buffer-Overflow.html", "ref_desc": "ABB IDAL HTTP Server Stack-Based Buffer Overflow \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jun/40", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: XL-19-011 - ABB IDAL HTTP Server Stack-Based Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108886", "ref_desc": "ABB PB610 Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YjQpw0WKwioJ_mx8gCDy0GDGYE4.html"}]}
