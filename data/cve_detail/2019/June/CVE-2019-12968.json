{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12968", "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the Sonic Robo Blast 2 (SRB2) plugin (EP_Versions 9 to 11 inclusive) distributed with Doomseeker 1.1 and 1.2. Affected plugin versions did not discard IP packets with an unnaturally long response length from a Sonic Robo Blast 2 master server, allowing a remote attacker to cause a potential crash / denial of service in Doomseeker. The issue has been remediated in the Doomseeker 1.3 release with source code patches to the SRB2 plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12968", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDrdteam\u00bbDoomseeker\u00bbVersion:1.2cpe:2.3:a:drdteam:doomseeker:1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDrdteam\u00bbDoomseeker\u00bbVersion:1.1cpe:2.3:a:drdteam:doomseeker:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.52%  0.47%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-11-16  0.45%  0.52%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-06-19  0.28%  0.45%  +0.17 \n 4  2024-05-01  0.39%  0.28%  -0.12 \n 5  2023-04-30  0.44%  0.39%  -0.05 \n 6  2023-04-15  0.37%  0.44%  +0.07 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.21%  0.37%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bitbucket.org/Doomseeker/doomseeker/commits/b9a90f1f56e704c5cbeefe83da2f9ce939920278", "ref_desc": "Doomseeker / Doomseeker / commit / b9a90f1f56e7 \u2014 BitbucketPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://zandronum.com/tracker/view.php?id=3660", "ref_desc": "0003660: SRB2 plugin: Mangled memory values (runtime crashes) - MantisBTThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bitbucket.org/Doomseeker/doomseeker/pull-requests/74/more-openbsd-issues-3654-the-srb2-thingy/diff", "ref_desc": "Doomseeker / Doomseeker / Pull request #74: More OpenBSD issues.
