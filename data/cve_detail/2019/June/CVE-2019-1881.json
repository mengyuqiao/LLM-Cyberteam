{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1881", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser and the privileges of the user to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1881", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIndustrial Network Director\u00bbVersion:1.5(0.250)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:industrial_network_director:1.5\\(0.250\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-26  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-11-01  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-07-15  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  5.25%  0.08%  -5.17 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-ind-csrf", "ref_desc": "Cisco Industrial Network Director Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108678", "ref_desc": "Cisco Industrial Network Director CVE-2019-1881 Cross Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
