{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12794", "Description": "An issue was discovered in MISP 2.4.108. Organization admins could reset credentials for site admins (organization admins have the inherent ability to reset passwords for all of their organization's users). This, however, could be abused in a situation where the host organization of an instance creates organization admins. An organization admin could set a password manually for the site admin or simply use the API key of the site admin to impersonate them. The potential for abuse only occurs when the host organization creates lower-privilege organization admins instead of the usual site admins. Also, only organization admins of the same organization as the site admin could abuse this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12794", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMisp\u00bbMisp\u00bbVersion:2.4.108cpe:2.3:a:misp:misp:2.4.108:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MISP/MISP/commit/36b43f1306873cff87b7aa30cdc1a30b38c9c16a", "ref_desc": "fix: [security] Org admins could reset credentials for site admins \u00b7 MISP/MISP@36b43f1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
