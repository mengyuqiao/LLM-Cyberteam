{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6972", "Description": "An issue was discovered on TP-Link TL-WR1043ND V2 devices. The credentials can be easily decoded and cracked by brute-force, WordList, or Rainbow Table attacks. Specifically, credentials in the \"Authorization\" cookie are encoded with URL encoding and base64, leading to easy decoding. Also, the username is cleartext, and the password is hashed with the MD5 algorithm (after decoding of the URL encoded string with base64).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6972", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTp-link\u00bbTl-wr1043nd Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.0cpe:2.3:o:tp-link:tl-wr1043nd_firmware:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Tp-link\u00bbTl-wr1043nd\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.37%  0.49%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-11-09  0.34%  0.37%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-08-23  0.48%  0.34%  -0.14 \n 4  2024-02-14  0.49%  0.48%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-01-13  0.53%  0.49%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-05-26  0.42%  0.53%  +0.11 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.42%  -0.47 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MalFuzzer/Vulnerability-Research/blob/master/TL-WR1043ND%20V2%20-%20TP-LINK/TL-WR1043ND_PoC.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability-Research/TL-WR1043ND_PoC.pdf at master \u00b7 MalFuzzer/Vulnerability-Research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2YMnvKs13tHR8Rtg3480MCgmRNw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/MalFuzzer/status/1141269335685652480?s=19", "ref_desc": "Uriel Kosayev on Twitter: \"Recently I found a vulnerability in TP-Link's home router.
