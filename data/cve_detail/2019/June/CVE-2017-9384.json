{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9384", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a web user interface that allows a user to manage the device. As a part of the functionality the device firmware file contains a file known as relay.sh which allows the device to create relay ports and connect the device to Vera servers. This is primarily used as a method of communication between the device and Vera servers so the devices can be communicated with even when the user is not at home. One of the parameters retrieved by this specific script is \"remote_host\". This parameter is not sanitized by the script correctly and is passed in a call to \"eval\" to execute another script where remote_host is concatenated to be passed a parameter to the second script. This allows an attacker to escape from the executed command and then execute any commands of his/her choice.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9384", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGetvera\u00bbVeraedge FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.19cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veraedge_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeraedge\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGetvera\u00bbVeralite FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.481cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veralite_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeralite\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.71% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.25%  0.71%  -0.54 \n 2  2024-11-07  1.27%  1.25%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-10-16  2.51%  1.27%  -1.25 \n 4  2024-06-28  2.42%  2.51%  +0.10 \n 5  2024-06-10  2.04%  2.42%  +0.38 \n 6  2024-02-12  2.17%  2.04%  -0.13 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  2.17%  +1.28 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153242/Veralite-Veraedge-Router-XSS-Command-Injection-CSRF-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Veralite / Veraedge Router XSS / Command Injection / CSRF / Traversal \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hdJusa7ybqBtroBWbHUvLs2lqGs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Vera_sec_issues.pdf", "ref_desc": "IoT_vulnerabilities/Vera_sec_issues.pdf at master \u00b7 ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yuptkwxI_AmzeWn_iFXSeacPbxM.html"}]}
