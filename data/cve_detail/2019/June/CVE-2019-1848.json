{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1848", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass authentication and access critical internal services. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access restriction to ports necessary for system operation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting an unauthorized network device to the subnet designated for cluster services. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to reach internal services that are not hardened for external access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1848", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbDigital Network Architecture CenterVersions  before (<) 1.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:digital_network_architecture_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.06%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108837", "ref_desc": "Cisco DNA Center Software CVE-2019-1848 Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-dnac-bypass", "ref_desc": "Cisco DNA Center Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
