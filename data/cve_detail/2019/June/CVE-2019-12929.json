{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12929", "Description": "The QMP guest_exec command in QEMU 4.0.0 and earlier is prone to OS command injection, which allows the attacker to achieve code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure by sending a crafted QMP command to the listening server. Note: This has been disputed as a non-issue since QEMU's -qmp interface is meant to be used by trusted users. If one is able to access this interface via a tcp socket open to the internet, then it is an insecure configuration issue", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12929", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nQemu\u00bbQemuVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:a:qemu:qemu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.47%  1.57%  +1.10 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.47%  -0.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://fakhrizulkifli.github.io/posts/2019/06/06/CVE-2019-12929/", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2019-12929] QEMU Guest Agent guest_exec Command Execution | Fakhri ZulkifliExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
