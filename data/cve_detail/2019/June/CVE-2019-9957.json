{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9957", "Description": "Stored XSS within Quadbase EspressReport ES (ERES) v7.0 update 7 allows remote attackers to execute malicious JavaScript and inject arbitrary source code into the target pages. The XSS payload is stored by creating a new user account, and setting the username to an XSS payload. The stored payload can then be triggered by accessing the \"Set Security Levels\" or \"View User/Group Relationships\" page. If the attacker does not currently have permission to create a new user, another vulnerability such as CSRF must be exploited first.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9957", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nQuadbase\u00bbEspressreport Es\u00bbVersion:7.0UpdateUpdate 7cpe:2.3:a:quadbase:espressreport_es:7.0:update_7:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://crawl3r.xyz/cve/cve-2019-9957/", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
