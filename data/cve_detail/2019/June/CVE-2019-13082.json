{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13082", "Description": "Chamilo LMS 1.11.8 and 2.x allows remote code execution through an lp_upload.php unauthenticated file upload feature. It extracts a ZIP archive before checking its content, and once it has been extracted, does not check files in a recursive way. This means that by putting a .php file in a folder and then this folder in a ZIP archive, the server will accept this file without any checks. Because one can access this file from the website, it is remote code execution. This is related to a scorm imsmanifest.xml file, the import_package function, and extraction in $courseSysDir.$newDir.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13082", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nChamilo\u00bbChamilo Lms\u00bbVersion:1.11.8cpe:2.3:a:chamilo:chamilo_lms:1.11.8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.61%  0.62%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-03  0.74%  0.61%  -0.13 \n 3  2023-08-09  0.59%  0.74%  +0.15 \n 4  2023-06-06  0.66%  0.59%  -0.07 \n 5  2023-04-19  0.58%  0.66%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-03-17  0.42%  0.58%  +0.15 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.43%  0.42%  -2.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.chamilo.org/projects/1/wiki/Security_issues", "ref_desc": "Security issues - Chamilo LMS - Chamilo Tracking SystemVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/F63nsrBhszrmT1NfFxAWmzFT7qs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://0xecute.com/?p=32", "ref_desc": "Chamilo \u2013 0xecuteExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
