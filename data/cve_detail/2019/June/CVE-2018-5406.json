{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5406", "Description": "The Quest Kace K1000 Appliance, versions prior to 9.0.270, allows a remote attacker to exploit the misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) mechanism. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance\u2019s settings. A malicious internal user could also gain administrator privileges of this appliance and use it to visit a malicious link that exploits this vulnerability. This could cause the application to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance\u2019s settings. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could add an administrator-level account or change the appliance's settings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5406", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nQuest\u00bbKace Systems Management Appliance FirmwareVersions  before (<) 9.0.270cpe:2.3:o:quest:kace_systems_management_appliance_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Quest\u00bbKace Systems Management Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.71%  0.50%  -0.20 \n 2  2024-10-24  0.60%  0.71%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-10-02  0.84%  0.60%  -0.25 \n 4  2024-09-11  0.84%  0.84%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-27  0.87%  0.84%  -0.04 \n 6  2024-01-17  1.13%  0.87%  -0.26 \n 7  2023-10-30  1.25%  1.13%  -0.12 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.14%  1.25%  +0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153150/Dell-KACE-System-Management-Appliance-SMA-XSS-SQL-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Dell KACE System Management Appliance (SMA) XSS / SQL Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LJfvyIwrVm8UXLGM6DNTzHVFJWY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.quest.com/kb/288310/cert-coordination-center-report-update", "ref_desc": "CERT Coordination Center report update (288310)Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mQ9CXcdNuPNVQbejCJd84YzIpPY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/877837/", "ref_desc": "VU#877837 - Multiple vulnerabilities in Quest Kace System Management ApplianceThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wvlt3I7SRyGuvQdxzzJzPIbdK4M.html"}]}
