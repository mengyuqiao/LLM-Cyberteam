{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1843", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reload the device and causing a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1843", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv110w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.2.2.4cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv110w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv110w\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv215w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.3.1.4cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv215w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv215w\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv130w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.3.51cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv130w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv130w\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-10  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.16%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-rvrouters-dos", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Management Interface Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108864", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV110W/RV130W/RV215W Routers CVE-2019-1843 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
