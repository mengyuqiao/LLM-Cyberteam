The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser and the privileges of the user to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1632", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIntegrated Management Controller\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:integrated_management_controller:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Computing System\u00bbVersion:4.0(1c)hs3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_computing_system:4.0\\(1c\\)hs3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-07-29  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108858", "ref_desc": "Cisco Integrated Management Controller CVE-2019-1632 Cross Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-imc-csrf", "ref_desc": "Cisco Integrated Management Controller Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
