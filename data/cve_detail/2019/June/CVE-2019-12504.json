{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12504", "Description": "Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated data communication, the wireless presenter Inateck WP2002 is prone to keystroke injection attacks. Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's computer system, e.g., to install malware when the target system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control over the victim's computer that is operated with an affected receiver of this device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12504", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nInateck\u00bbWp2002 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:inateck:wp2002_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Inateck\u00bbWp2002\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.27%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-12-07  0.27%  0.22%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-10-28  0.28%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-07-05  0.39%  0.28%  -0.11 \n 5  2024-05-31  0.33%  0.39%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-03-27  0.28%  0.33%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.28%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jun/14", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2019-008]: Inateck 2.4 GHz Wearable Wireless Presenter WP2002 - Keystroke Injection VulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153185/Inateck-2.4-GHz-Wearable-Wireless-Presenter-WP2002-Keystroke-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Inateck 2.4 GHz Wearable Wireless Presenter WP2002 Keystroke Injection \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2019-008.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/3", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: [SYSS-2019-008]: Inateck 2.4 GHz Wearable Wireless Presenter WP2002 - Keystroke Injection VulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
