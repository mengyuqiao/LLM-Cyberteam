{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3895", "Description": "An access-control flaw was found in the Octavia service when the cloud platform was deployed using Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director. An attacker could cause new amphorae to run based on any arbitrary image. This meant that a remote attacker could upload a new amphorae image and, if requested to spawn new amphorae, Octavia would then pick up the compromised image.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3895", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenstack\u00bbVersion:12cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openstack:12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbOctaviaVersions  before (<) 0.9.0cpe:2.3:a:openstack:octavia:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-24  0.39%  0.41%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-05-27  0.28%  0.39%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-04-24  0.39%  0.28%  -0.12 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.39%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-3895", "ref_desc": "1694608 \u2013 (CVE-2019-3895) CVE-2019-3895 openstack-tripleo-common: Allows running new amphorae based on arbitrary imagesIssue Tracking;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1683", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:1683 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1742", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2019:1742 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
