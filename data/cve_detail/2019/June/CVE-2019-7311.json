{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-7311", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Linksys WRT1900ACS 1.0.3.187766 devices. A lack of encryption in how the user login cookie (admin-auth) is stored on a victim's computer results in the admin password being discoverable by a local attacker, and usable to gain administrative access to the victim's router. The admin password is stored in base64 cleartext in an \"admin-auth\" cookie. An attacker sniffing the network at the time of login could acquire the router's admin password. Alternatively, gaining physical access to the victim's computer soon after an administrative login could result in compromise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7311", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinksys\u00bbWrt1900acs Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.0.3.187766cpe:2.3:o:linksys:wrt1900acs_firmware:1.0.3.187766:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linksys\u00bbWrt1900acs\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://robot-security.blogspot.com", "ref_desc": "Robot SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/b_avggn7puVssoBAKF0iCn8LGAI.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.x0rsecurity.com/2019/05/03/my-first-cve-linksys-wrt-1300-acs-cve-2019-7311/", "ref_desc": "My First CVE- Linksys WRT 1300 ACS- CVE-2019-7311 \u2013 T0b0rx0r Blog!Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
