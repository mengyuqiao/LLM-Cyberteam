{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1620", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect permission settings in affected DCNM software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading specially crafted data to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files on the filesystem and execute code with root privileges on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1620", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbData Center Network Manager\u00bbVersion:11.0(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:data_center_network_manager:11.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "49.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  42.47%  49.64%  +7.17 \n 2  2024-11-17  49.16%  42.47%  -6.68 \n 3  2024-10-26  51.73%  49.16%  -2.57 \n 4  2024-09-18  52.85%  51.73%  -1.12 \n 5  2024-06-19  58.02%  52.85%  -5.17 \n 6  2024-06-04  65.01%  58.02%  -6.99 \n 7  2024-03-26  60.75%  65.01%  +4.26 \n 8  2024-02-09  64.39%  60.75%  -3.64 \n 9  2024-01-20  67.86%  64.39%  -3.46 \n 10  2023-11-22  65.10%  67.86%  +2.75 \n 11  2023-11-07  63.08%  65.10%  +2.02 \n 12  2023-10-20  64.07%  63.08%  -0.99 \n 13  2023-09-21  70.38%  64.07%  -6.31 \n 14  2023-06-19  71.58%  70.38%  -1.20 \n 15  2023-05-17  72.07%  71.58%  -0.49 \n 16  2023-04-15  71.32%  72.07%  +0.75 \n 17  2023-03-07  6.73%  71.32%  +64.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jul/11", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Cisco Data Center Manager multiple vulns; RCE as rootMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/08_e4Uu5oNTCLV5xklTnopkaNrk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190626-dcnm-codex", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager Arbitrary File Upload and Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153546/Cisco-Data-Center-Network-Manager-11.1-1-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager 11.1(1) Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4lcHXxx5OPQHftpUZYIINEXtwdM.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jul/7", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Cisco Data Center Manager multiple vulns; RCE as rootMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vbOFrAbXSyGY_7X3WHJ4S5KyKOo.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154304/Cisco-Data-Center-Network-Manager-Unauthenticated-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VJWtBGbuX5tOc7PfL99f0Z2wH4A.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108906", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager CVE-2019-1620 Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
