{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9390", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a shell script called connect.sh which is supposed to return a specific cookie for the user when the user is authenticated to https://home.getvera.com. One of the parameters retrieved by this script is \"RedirectURL\". However, the application lacks strict input validation of this parameter and this allows an attacker to execute the client-side code on this application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9390", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGetvera\u00bbVeraedge FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.19cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veraedge_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeraedge\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGetvera\u00bbVeralite FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.481cpe:2.3:o:getvera:veralite_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Getvera\u00bbVeralite\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  1.20%  +1.03 \n 2  2024-11-07  0.27%  0.18%  -0.09 \n 3  2024-10-16  0.38%  0.27%  -0.11 \n 4  2024-06-28  0.54%  0.38%  -0.16 \n 5  2024-06-10  0.51%  0.54%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-04-22  0.54%  0.51%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.54%  -0.41 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153242/Veralite-Veraedge-Router-XSS-Command-Injection-CSRF-Traversal.html", "ref_desc": "Veralite / Veraedge Router XSS / Command Injection / CSRF / Traversal \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hdJusa7ybqBtroBWbHUvLs2lqGs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Vera_sec_issues.pdf", "ref_desc": "IoT_vulnerabilities/Vera_sec_issues.pdf at master \u00b7 ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yuptkwxI_AmzeWn_iFXSeacPbxM.html"}]}
