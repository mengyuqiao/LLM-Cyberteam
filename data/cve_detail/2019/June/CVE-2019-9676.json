{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9676", "Description": "Buffer overflow vulnerability found in some Dahua IP Camera devices IPC-HFW1XXX,IPC-HDW1XXX,IPC-HFW2XXX Build before 2018/11. The vulnerability exits in the function of redirection display for serial port printing information, which can not be used by product basic functions. After an attacker logs in locally, this vulnerability can be exploited to cause device restart or arbitrary code execution. Dahua has identified the corresponding security problems in the static code auditing process, so it has gradually deleted this function, which is no longer available in the newer devices and softwares. Dahua has released versions of the affected products to fix the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9676", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nDahuasecurity\u00bbIpc-hfw1xxx FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2018-11cpe:2.3:o:dahuasecurity:ipc-hfw1xxx_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dahuasecurity\u00bbIpc-hfw1xxx\u00bbVersion:N/A\nDahuasecurity\u00bbIpc-hdw1xxx FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2018-11cpe:2.3:o:dahuasecurity:ipc-hdw1xxx_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dahuasecurity\u00bbIpc-hdw1xxx\u00bbVersion:N/A\nDahuasecurity\u00bbIpc-hfw2xxx FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2018-11cpe:2.3:o:dahuasecurity:ipc-hfw2xxx_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dahuasecurity\u00bbIpc-hfw2xxx\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.dahuasecurity.com/support/cybersecurity/details/617", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory - Buffer overflow vulnerability found in some Dahua IP Camera devicesPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
