{"CVE Code": "CVE-2018-18425", "Description": "The doAirdrop function of a smart contract implementation for Primeo (PEO), an Ethereum token, does not check the numerical relationship between the amount of the air drop and the token's total supply, which lets the owner of the contract issue an arbitrary amount of currency. (Increasing the total supply by using 'doAirdrop' ignores the hard cap written in the contract and devalues the token.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18425", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPrimeo Project\u00bbPrimeo\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:primeo_project:primeo:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-11-09  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.jianshu.com/p/09f238e9e568", "ref_desc": "Primeo (PEO)\u589e\u53d1\u6f0f\u6d1e - \u7b80\u4e66Exploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://etherscan.io/address/0x21a8a03b34e053f9b1d4545213d9d1d411a9d449#code", "ref_desc": "Ethereum Accounts, Addresses and ContractsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
