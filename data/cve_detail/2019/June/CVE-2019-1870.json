{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1870", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1870", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Chat And Email\u00bbVersion:11.6(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_chat_and_email:11.6\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Chat And Email\u00bbVersion:11.6(1)es6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_chat_and_email:11.6\\(1\\)es6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.07%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-10-26  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-06-29  0.22%  0.16%  -0.07 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.22%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-ece-xss", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108645", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email CVE-2019-1870 Cross Site Scripting VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
