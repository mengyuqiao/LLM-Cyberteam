{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12741", "Description": "XSS exists in the HAPI FHIR testpage overlay module of the HAPI FHIR library before 3.8.0. The attack involves unsanitized HTTP parameters being output in a form page, allowing attackers to leak cookies and other sensitive information from ca/uhn/fhir/to/BaseController.java via a specially crafted URL. (This module is not generally used in production systems so the attack surface is expected to be low, but affected systems are recommended to upgrade immediately.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12741", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nFhir\u00bbHapi FhirVersions  before (<) 3.8.0cpe:2.3:a:fhir:hapi_fhir:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-29  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2023-04-09  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/issues/1335", "ref_desc": "Potential XSS exploit in hapi-fhir-testpage-overlay \u00b7 Issue #1335 \u00b7 jamesagnew/hapi-fhir \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/commit/8f41159eb147eeb964cad68b28eff97acac6ea9a", "ref_desc": "Fix a potential security vulneability in the testpage overlay \u00b7 jamesagnew/hapi-fhir@8f41159 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/releases/tag/v3.8.0", "ref_desc": "Release HAPI FHIR 3.8.0 (Hippo) \u00b7 jamesagnew/hapi-fhir \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
