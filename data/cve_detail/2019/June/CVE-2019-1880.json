{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-1880", "Description": "A vulnerability in the BIOS upgrade utility of Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) C-Series Rack Servers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to install compromised BIOS firmware on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the firmware image file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing the BIOS upgrade utility with a specific set of options. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the firmware signature-verification process and install compromised BIOS firmware on an affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1880", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Computing System Server FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andbefore (<) 4.0\\(2g\\)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:unified_computing_system_server_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbUnified Computing System C220 M4\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbUnified Computing System Server FirmwareVersions  before (<) 3.0\\(4l\\)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:unified_computing_system_server_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbUnified Computing System C220 M4\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbUnified Computing System Server FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.0\\(4c\\)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:unified_computing_system_server_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbUnified Computing System C220 M5\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbUnified Computing System Server FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.0\\(2g\\)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:unified_computing_system_server_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbUnified Computing System C125 M5\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-ucs-biossig-bypass", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Computing System BIOS Signature Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108680", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Computing System Central Software CVE-2019-1880 Security Bypass Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
