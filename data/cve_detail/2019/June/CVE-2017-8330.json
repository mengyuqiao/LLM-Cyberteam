{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8330", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a UPnP functionality for devices to interface with the router and interact with the device. It seems that the \"NewInMessage\" SOAP parameter passed with a huge payload results in crashing the process. If the firmware version AL-R096 is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cpio-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The binary \"miniupnpd\" is the one that has the vulnerable function that receives the values sent by the SOAP request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows a MIPS little endian format. The function WscDevPutMessage at address 0x0041DBB8 in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the SOAP request. The SOAP parameter \"NewInMesage\" received at address 0x0041DC30 causes the miniupnpd process to finally crash when a second request is sent to the same process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8330", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSecurifi\u00bbAlmond Firmware\u00bbVersion:Al-r096cpe:2.3:o:securifi:almond_firmware:al-r096:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Securifi\u00bbAlmond\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSecurifi\u00bbAlmond 2015 Firmware\u00bbVersion:Al-r096cpe:2.3:o:securifi:almond_2015_firmware:al-r096:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Securifi\u00bbAlmond 2015\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSecurifi\u00bbAlmond+firmware\u00bbVersion:Al-r096cpe:2.3:o:securifi:almond\\+firmware:al-r096:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Securifi\u00bbAlmond+\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-08  0.11%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-07-16  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-06-29  0.16%  0.11%  -0.05 \n 5  2024-06-11  0.14%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Newly releases IoT security issuesMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8mBVE4wI-_TPzqi5Km7hUU498ac.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153227/Securifi-Almond-2015-Buffer-Overflow-Command-Injection-XSS-CSRF.html", "ref_desc": "Securifi Almond 2015 Buffer Overflow / Command Injection / XSS / CSRF \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/B_pcyOJs1y82psb6QTMwE63i8Aw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Securifi_Almond_plus_sec_issues.pdf", "ref_desc": "IoT_vulnerabilities/Securifi_Almond_plus_sec_issues.pdf at master \u00b7 ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TWYyjHZ2xXBJN0VOfoHRyPA1p0k.html"}]}
