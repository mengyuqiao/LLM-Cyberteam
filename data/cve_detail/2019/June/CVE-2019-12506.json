{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12506", "Description": "Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated data communication, the wireless presenter Logitech R700 Laser Presentation Remote R-R0010 is prone to keystroke injection attacks. Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's computer system, e.g., to install malware when the target system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control over the victim's computer that is operated with an affected receiver of this device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12506", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLogitech\u00bbR700 Laser Presentation Remote Firmware\u00bbVersion:Wd802xmcpe:2.3:o:logitech:r700_laser_presentation_remote_firmware:wd802xm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Logitech\u00bbR700 Laser Presentation Remote\u00bbVersion:N/A\nLogitech\u00bbR700 Laser Presentation Remote Firmware\u00bbVersion:Wd904xmcpe:2.3:o:logitech:r700_laser_presentation_remote_firmware:wd904xm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Logitech\u00bbR700 Laser Presentation Remote\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-28  0.30%  0.21%  -0.10 \n 3  2024-10-06  0.43%  0.30%  -0.13 \n 4  2024-07-05  0.43%  0.43%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-05-31  0.30%  0.43%  +0.13 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.30%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153186/Logitech-R700-Laser-Presentation-Remote-Keystroke-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Logitech R700 Laser Presentation Remote Keystroke Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2019-015.txt", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/4", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: [SYSS-2019-015]: Logitech R700 Laser Presentation Remote - Keystroke Injection VulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory;Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jun/15", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2019-015]: Logitech R700 Laser Presentation Remote - Keystroke Injection Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
