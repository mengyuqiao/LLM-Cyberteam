{"CVE Code": "CVE-2019-13035", "Description": "Artica Pandora FMS 7.0 NG before 735 suffers from local privilege escalation due to improper permissions on C:\\PandoraFMS and its sub-folders, allowing standard users to create new files. Moreover, the Apache service httpd.exe will try to execute cmd.exe from C:\\PandoraFMS (the current directory) as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM upon web requests to the portal. This will effectively allow non-privileged users to escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13035", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nPandorafms\u00bbPandora FmsVersions  before (<) 7.0_ng_735cpe:2.3:a:pandorafms:pandora_fms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/active-labs/Advisories/blob/master/2019/ACTIVE-2019-008.md", "ref_desc": "Advisories/ACTIVE-2019-008.md at master \u00b7 active-labs/Advisories \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
