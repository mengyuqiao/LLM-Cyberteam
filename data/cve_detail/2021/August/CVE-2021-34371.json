{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34371", "Description": "Neo4j through 3.4.18 (with the shell server enabled) exposes an RMI service that arbitrarily deserializes Java objects, e.g., through setSessionVariable. An attacker can abuse this for remote code execution because there are dependencies with exploitable gadget chains.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34371", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNeo4j\u00bbNeo4j\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.4.18cpe:2.3:a:neo4j:neo4j:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "8.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  6.88%  8.05%  +1.17 \n 2  2024-07-24  6.20%  6.88%  +0.67 \n 3  2024-04-20  4.95%  6.20%  +1.25 \n 4  2024-03-11  4.05%  4.95%  +0.90 \n 5  2024-01-18  3.91%  4.05%  +0.14 \n 6  2023-10-28  3.87%  3.91%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-07-21  3.24%  3.87%  +0.62 \n 8  2023-04-25  3.05%  3.24%  +0.20 \n 9  2023-03-13  2.67%  3.05%  +0.38 \n 10  2023-03-07  3.18%  2.67%  -0.51 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50170", "ref_desc": "Neo4j 3.4.18 - RMI based Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Java remote ExploitExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
