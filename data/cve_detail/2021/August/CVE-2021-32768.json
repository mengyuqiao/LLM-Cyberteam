{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32768", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. In affected versions failing to properly parse, sanitize and encode malicious rich-text content, the content rendering process in the website frontend is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Corresponding rendering instructions via TypoScript functionality HTMLparser does not consider all potentially malicious HTML tag & attribute combinations per default. In default scenarios, a valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability. In case custom plugins used in the website frontend accept and reflect rich-text content submitted by users, no authentication is required. Update to TYPO3 versions 7.6.53 ELTS, 8.7.42 ELTS, 9.5.29, 10.4.19, 11.3.2 that fix the problem described.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32768", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3\u00bb     EltsEditionVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.7.41cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:elts:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 11.3.1cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 9.5.28cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3\u00bb     EltsEditionVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.6.52cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:elts:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 10.4.18cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-04-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-16  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-c5c9-8c6m-727v", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting via Rich-Text Content \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-013", "ref_desc": "Page Not FoundVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
