{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36762", "Description": "An issue was discovered in HCC Embedded InterNiche NicheStack through 4.3. The tfshnd():tftpsrv.c TFTP packet processing function doesn't ensure that a filename is adequately '\\0' terminated; therefore, a subsequent call to strlen for the filename might read out of bounds of the protocol packet buffer (if no '\\0' byte exists within a reasonable range).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36762", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHcc-embedded\u00bbNichestackVersions  before (<) 4.3cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:nichestack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-04  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-25  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-28  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-12  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-273 Improper Check for Dropped Privileges", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/273/Improper-Check-for-Dropped-Privileges.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-operational-technology-vulnerabilities-found-on-nichestack/", "ref_desc": "New Critical Operational Technology Vulnerabilities Found on NicheStack \u2013 Mitigation Advised - ForescoutMitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/l5uwnaCYRQud8WLr0TbcpZCwhfg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.hcc-embedded.com/about/about-interniche", "ref_desc": "About InterNicheProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lcEVn2bsistRmBqlcLOmBmdaTgU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/608209", "ref_desc": "VU#608209 - NicheStack embedded TCP/IP has vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o7Oo5HR02rJwxvQI3KfwFDiR7PU.html"}]}
