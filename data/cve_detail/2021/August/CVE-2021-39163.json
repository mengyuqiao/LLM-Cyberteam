{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39163", "Description": "Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39163", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.41.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-24  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.41.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.41.1 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/f0xQU5z06sM2W9x_hJqyUK_0ylk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jj53-8fmw-f2w2", "ref_desc": "Adding a private/unlisted room to a community exposes room metadata in an unauthorised manner. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXT7ID7DNBRN2TVTETU3SYQHJKEG6PXN/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: matrix-synapse-1.41.1-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/M4fdST8idyhyBk3KACF3u--eF3U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2VHDEPCZ22GJFMZCWA2XZAGPOEV72POF/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: matrix-synapse-1.41.1-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pd55dqBhYYdNVA8OPWJr-c3Qybw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/cb35df940a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jj53-8fmw-f2w2 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse@cb35df9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SOGyTjVVJw_AgVzP5mjiF6YqeGc.html"}]}
