{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37701", "Description": "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37701", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOracle\u00bbGraalvm\u00bbVersion:20.3.3    EnterpriseEditioncpe:2.3:a:oracle:graalvm:20.3.3:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nOracle\u00bbGraalvm\u00bbVersion:21.2.0    EnterpriseEditioncpe:2.3:a:oracle:graalvm:21.2.0:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nSiemens\u00bbSinec Infrastructure Network ServicesVersions  before (<) 1.0.1.1cpe:2.3:a:siemens:sinec_infrastructure_network_services:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNpmjs\u00bbTAR\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.1.7cpe:2.3:a:npmjs:tar:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nNpmjs\u00bbTAR\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.8cpe:2.3:a:npmjs:tar:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nNpmjs\u00bbTAR\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.4.16cpe:2.3:a:npmjs:tar:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-05-16  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-06  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-24  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.72%  0.11%  -1.61 \n 6  2023-02-23  3.64%  1.72%  -1.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar", "ref_desc": "tar - npmProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/C0J2CxjZJf8ph9ZCcfZgnA2tFsg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00023.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3237-1] node-tar security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JMeJuVsg0lk7L_NIAgBJRJ6trT0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RWUpGy9G_gyGrISbxe-OvGRBVAM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5008", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5008-1 node-tarThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Wq44ntdI4sxfFSb8wscsaCSO6Dg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite via insufficient symlink protection due to directory cache poisoning using symbolic links \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 npm/node-tar \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WZWxfkA5Nfx_T-RjFs6OqiqIM9U.html"}]}
