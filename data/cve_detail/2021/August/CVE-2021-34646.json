{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34646", "Description": "Versions up to, and including, 5.4.3, of the Booster for WooCommerce WordPress plugin are vulnerable to authentication bypass via the process_email_verification function due to a random token generation weakness in the reset_and_mail_activation_link function found in the ~/includes/class-wcj-emails-verification.php file. This allows attackers to impersonate users and trigger an email address verification for arbitrary accounts, including administrative accounts, and automatically be logged in as that user, including any site administrators. This requires the Email Verification module to be active in the plugin and the Login User After Successful Verification setting to be enabled, which it is by default.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34646", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBooster\u00bbBooster For Woocommerce\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.4.3cpe:2.3:a:booster:booster_for_woocommerce:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "20.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.76%  20.19%  +14.43 \n 2  2024-12-16  4.23%  5.76%  +1.53 \n 3  2024-11-16  4.50%  4.23%  -0.27 \n 4  2024-10-31  3.98%  4.50%  +0.52 \n 5  2024-10-02  3.61%  3.98%  +0.37 \n 6  2024-07-16  3.22%  3.61%  +0.40 \n 7  2024-06-19  2.55%  3.22%  +0.67 \n 8  2024-05-09  2.23%  2.55%  +0.32 \n 9  2024-04-13  2.59%  2.23%  -0.36 \n 10  2024-03-30  2.11%  2.59%  +0.49 \n 11  2023-04-07  2.27%  2.11%  -0.16 \n 12  2023-03-23  1.53%  2.27%  +0.74 \n 13  2023-03-07  23.85%  1.53%  -22.31 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/08/critical-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-patched-in-booster-for-woocommerce/", "ref_desc": "Critical Authentication Bypass Vulnerability Patched in Booster for WooCommerceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2581212%40woocommerce-jetpack&new=2581212%40woocommerce-jetpack&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "ref_desc": "Changeset 2581212 for woocommerce-jetpack \u2013 WordPress Plugin RepositoryPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
