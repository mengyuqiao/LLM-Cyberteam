{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33191", "Description": "From Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ version 0.5.0 the c2 protocol implements an \"agent-update\" command which was designed to patch the application binary. This \"patching\" command defaults to calling a trusted binary, but might be modified to an arbitrary value through a \"c2-update\" command. Said command is then executed using the same privileges as the application binary. This was addressed in version 0.10.0", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33191", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbNifi Minifi C++Versions  from including (>=) 0.5.0andbefore (<) 0.10.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:nifi_minifi_c\\+\\+:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.38%  1.11%  -0.27 \n 2  2024-07-16  1.96%  1.38%  -0.58 \n 3  2024-05-09  1.72%  1.96%  +0.23 \n 4  2024-03-30  1.67%  1.72%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-11-08  2.00%  1.67%  -0.33 \n 6  2023-04-29  1.56%  2.00%  +0.44 \n 7  2023-04-15  1.35%  1.56%  +0.22 \n 8  2023-04-01  1.17%  1.35%  +0.18 \n 9  2023-03-17  1.21%  1.17%  -0.04 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  1.21%  +0.25 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/24/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-33191: Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++: MiNiFi CPP arbitrary script execution is possible on the agent's host machine through the c2 protocolMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/24/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-33191: Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++: MiNiFi CPP arbitrary script execution is possible on the agent's host machine through the c2 protocolMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r6f27a2454f5f67dbe4e21c8eb1db537b01863a0bc3758f28aa60f032@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-33191: Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++: MiNiFi CPP arbitrary script execution is possible on the agent's host machine through the c2 protocol - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
