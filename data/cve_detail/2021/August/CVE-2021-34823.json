{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34823", "Description": "The ON24 ScreenShare (aka DesktopScreenShare.app) plugin before 2.0 for macOS allows remote file access via its built-in HTTP server. This allows unauthenticated remote users to retrieve files accessible to the logged-on macOS user. When a remote user sends a crafted HTTP request to the server, it triggers a code path that will download a configuration file from a specified remote machine over HTTP. There is an XXE flaw in processing of this configuration file that allows reading local (to macOS) files and uploading them to remote machines.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34823", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nOn24\u00bbScreenshare\u00bbForMacosVersions  before (<) 2.0cpe:2.3:a:on24:screenshare:*:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.30%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-08-16  0.41%  0.42%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-21  0.39%  0.41%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-28  0.28%  0.39%  +0.11 \n 5  2024-03-19  0.21%  0.28%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-07-29  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.21%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=29105", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories | TrustwaveThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QyMZrWm9h-XnyRF872lQpnMdHT4.html"}]}
