{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36804", "Description": "Akaunting version 2.1.12 and earlier suffers from a password reset spoofing vulnerability, wherein an attacker can proxy password reset requests through a running Akaunting instance, if that attacker knows the target's e-mail address. This issue was fixed in version 2.1.13 of the product. Please note that this issue is ultimately caused by the defaults provided by the Laravel framework, specifically how proxy headers are handled with respect to multi-tenant implementations. In other words, while this is not technically a vulnerability in Laravel, this default configuration is very likely to lead to practically identical identical vulnerabilities in Laravel projects that implement multi-tenant applications.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36804", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAkaunting\u00bbAkauntingVersions  before (<) 2.1.13cpe:2.3:a:akaunting:akaunting:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.40%  +0.17 \n 2  2024-12-07  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-04-11  0.18%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-02  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-10-27  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/07/27/multiple-open-source-web-app-vulnerabilities-fixed/", "ref_desc": "Multiple Open Source Web App Vulnerabilities Fixed | Rapid7 BlogExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6pfpejWHLFmLQwRBscYElZMG-rQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.laravel-enlightn.com/docs/security/host-injection-analyzer.html", "ref_desc": "Host Injection Analyzer | EnlightnThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/laravel/pull/5477", "ref_desc": "[8.x] Uncomment TrustHosts middleware to enable it by default by DanielCoulbourne \u00b7 Pull Request #5477 \u00b7 laravel/laravel \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
