{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-38549", "Description": "MIRACASE MHUB500 USB splitters through 2021-08-09, in certain specific use cases in which the device supplies power to audio-output equipment, allow remote attackers to recover speech signals from an LED on the device, via a telescope and an electro-optical sensor, aka a \"Glowworm\" attack. We assume that the USB splitter supplies power to some speakers. The power indicator LED of the USB splitter is connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of the USB splitter's power indicator LED is correlative to its power consumption. The sound played by the connected speakers affects the USB splitter's power consumption and as a result is also correlative to the light intensity of the LED. By analyzing measurements obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of the USB splitter, we can recover the sound played by the connected speakers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38549", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBenda\u00bbMiracase Hmub500 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2021-08-09cpe:2.3:o:benda:miracase_hmub500_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Benda\u00bbMiracase Hmub500\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.56%  0.50%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-12-14  0.52%  0.56%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-14  0.51%  0.52%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-26  0.46%  0.51%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-03-17  0.38%  0.46%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-11-03  0.29%  0.38%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-07-27  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.28%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.nassiben.com/glowworm-attack", "ref_desc": "Glowworm-AttackExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MV1doxAqeLxvzzs7z4FTvxO0vbQ.html"}]}
