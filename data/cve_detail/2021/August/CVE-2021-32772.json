{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32772", "Description": "Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32772", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nElectronjs\u00bbPoddycast\u00bbVersion:0.8.0cpe:2.3:a:electronjs:poddycast:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.75% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.21%  1.75%  +0.54 \n 2  2024-04-18  1.19%  1.21%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-03-09  1.10%  1.19%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-02-12  0.93%  1.10%  +0.17 \n 5  2023-03-25  0.57%  0.93%  +0.36 \n 6  2023-03-11  0.48%  0.57%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-03-07  4.84%  0.48%  -4.35 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MrChuckomo/poddycast/blob/8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9/app/js/helper/helper_entries.js#L80", "ref_desc": "poddycast/helper_entries.js at 8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9 \u00b7 MrChuckomo/poddycast \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MrChuckomo/poddycast/blob/8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9/app/js/favorite.js#L4-L14", "ref_desc": "poddycast/favorite.js at 8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9 \u00b7 MrChuckomo/poddycast \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MrChuckomo/poddycast/blob/8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9/app/js/feed.js#L285", "ref_desc": "poddycast/feed.js at 8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9 \u00b7 MrChuckomo/poddycast \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MrChuckomo/poddycast/security/advisories/GHSA-wjmh-9fj2-rqh6", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') in helper_entries \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 MrChuckomo/poddycast \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
