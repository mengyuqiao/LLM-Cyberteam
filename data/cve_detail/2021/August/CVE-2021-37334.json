{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37334", "Description": "Umbraco Forms version 4.0.0 up to and including 8.7.5 and below are vulnerable to a security flaw that could lead to a remote code execution attack and/or arbitrary file deletion. A vulnerability occurs because validation of the file extension is performed after the file has been stored in a temporary directory. By default, files are stored within the application directory structure at %BASEDIR%/APP_DATA/TEMP/FileUploads/. Whilst access to this directory is restricted by the root web.config file, it is possible to override this restriction by uploading another specially crafted web.config file to the temporary directory. It is possible to exploit this flaw to upload a malicious script file to execute arbitrary code and system commands on the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37334", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 8.4.0andbefore (<) 8.4.4cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 8.2.0andbefore (<) 8.2.3cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.4.9cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 7.3.0andbefore (<) 7.3.2cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 8.6.0andbefore (<) 8.6.2cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.0.10cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 7.1.0andbefore (<) 7.1.4cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 8.5.0andbefore (<) 8.5.7cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 8.1.0andbefore (<) 8.1.6cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 7.5.0andbefore (<) 7.5.4cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 8.3.0andbefore (<) 8.3.4cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.0.2cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 8.7.0andbefore (<) 8.7.6cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 7.4.0andbefore (<) 7.4.3cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.7cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbFormsVersions  from including (>=) 7.2.0andbefore (<) 7.2.1cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:forms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-26  1.68%  2.36%  +0.68 \n 2  2024-08-13  1.19%  1.68%  +0.49 \n 3  2024-07-31  1.13%  1.19%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-05-10  1.05%  1.13%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-03-31  1.02%  1.05%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-11-17  0.84%  1.02%  +0.18 \n 7  2023-08-10  0.80%  0.84%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-04-02  0.57%  0.80%  +0.23 \n 9  2023-03-18  0.54%  0.57%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.68%  0.54%  -1.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://umbraco.com/blog/security-advisory-security-patches-for-umbraco-forms-ready-on-july-20th-2021-at-7-am-utc/", "ref_desc": "Security advisory: Security patch ready on July 20th, 2021Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://umbraco.com/blog/security-advisory-20th-of-july-2021-patch-is-now-available/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory 20th of July, 2021: Patch is now availablePatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
