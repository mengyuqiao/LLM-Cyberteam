{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37704", "Description": "PhpFastCache is a high-performance backend cache system (packagist package phpfastcache/phpfastcache). In versions before 6.1.5, 7.1.2, and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8 will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched. As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37704", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nPhpfastcache\u00bbPhpfastcacheVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.1.2cpe:2.3:a:phpfastcache:phpfastcache:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPhpfastcache\u00bbPhpfastcacheVersions  before (<) 6.1.5cpe:2.3:a:phpfastcache:phpfastcache:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPhpfastcache\u00bbPhpfastcacheVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.0.7cpe:2.3:a:phpfastcache:phpfastcache:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.67%  1.21%  +0.55 \n 2  2024-09-28  0.62%  0.67%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-04-01  0.55%  0.62%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-01-25  0.37%  0.55%  +0.18 \n 5  2023-12-29  0.28%  0.37%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-11-05  0.28%  0.28%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-04-03  0.26%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.26%  -0.85 \n 9  2023-02-22  21.35%  1.10%  -20.25 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flextype/flextype/issues/567", "ref_desc": "phpinfo (phpinfo.php) shows PHP information including values of HttpOnly cookies. \u00b7 Issue #567 \u00b7 flextype/flextype \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/phpfastcache/phpfastcache", "ref_desc": "phpfastcache/phpfastcache - PackagistProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/pull/815", "ref_desc": "[V6] Fixed vulnerability issue that cause exposed phpinfo() in some situations by Geolim4 \u00b7 Pull Request #815 \u00b7 PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/pull/813", "ref_desc": "[V8] Fixed vulnerability issue that cause exposed phpinfo() in some situations by Geolim4 \u00b7 Pull Request #813 \u00b7 PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#807", "ref_desc": "phpfastcache/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/security/advisories/GHSA-cvh5-p6r6-g2qc", "ref_desc": "Exposed phpinfo() leadked via documentation files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/pull/814", "ref_desc": "[V7] Fixed vulnerability issue that cause exposed phpinfo() in some situations by Geolim4 \u00b7 Pull Request #814 \u00b7 PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/commit/41a77d0d8f126dbd6fbedcd9e6a82e86cdaafa51", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #813 from Geolim4/master \u00b7 PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache@41a77d0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
