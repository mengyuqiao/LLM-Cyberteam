{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37617", "Description": "The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer. The Nextcloud Desktop Client invokes its uninstaller script when being installed to make sure there are no remnants of previous installations. In versions 3.0.3 through 3.2.4, the Client searches the `Uninstall.exe` file in a folder that can be written by regular users. This could lead to a case where a malicious user creates a malicious `Uninstall.exe`, which would be executed with administrative privileges on the Nextcloud Desktop Client installation. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted users to create content in the `C:\\` system folder and verify that there is no malicious `C:\\Uninstall.exe` file on the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37617", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbDesktopVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.3andbefore (<) 3.3.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-11  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/3497", "ref_desc": "Run legacy uninstall exe in a secure way by allexzander \u00b7 Pull Request #3497 \u00b7 nextcloud/desktop \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-6q2w-v879-q24v", "ref_desc": "Untrusted Search Path in Nextcloud Desktop Client \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1240749", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
