{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32798", "Description": "The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on load. Jupyter Notebook uses a deprecated version of Google Caja to sanitize user inputs. A public Caja bypass can be used to trigger an XSS when a victim opens a malicious ipynb document in Jupyter Notebook. The XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim computer using Jupyter APIs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32798", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbNotebookVersions  from including (>=) 5.7.0andbefore (<) 5.7.11cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:notebook:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJupyter\u00bbNotebook\u00bbVersion:6.4.0cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:notebook:6.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.32%  +0.11 \n 2  2024-12-12  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-07-15  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-24  0.18%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 5  2024-03-15  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.18%  -1.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/security/advisories/GHSA-hwvq-6gjx-j797", "ref_desc": "Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection) in notebook \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyter/notebook \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/commit/79fc76e890a8ec42f73a3d009e44ef84c14ef0d5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hwvq-6gjx-j797 \u00b7 jupyter/notebook@79fc76e \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
