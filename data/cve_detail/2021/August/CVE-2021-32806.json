{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32806", "Description": "Products.isurlinportal is a replacement for isURLInPortal method in Plone. Versions of Products.isurlinportal prior to 1.2.0 have an Open Redirect vulnerability. Various parts of Plone use the 'is url in portal' check for security, mostly to see if it is safe to redirect to a url. A url like `https://example.org` is not in the portal. The url `https:example.org` without slashes is considered to be in the portal. When redirecting, some browsers go to `https://example.org`, others give an error. Attackers may use this to redirect victims to their site, especially as part of a phishing attack. The problem has been patched in Products.isurlinportal 1.2.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32806", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nPlone\u00bbIsurlinportal\u00bbForPloneVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:plone:isurlinportal:*:*:*:*:*:plone:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-04-17  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-03-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-02-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/plone/Products.isurlinportal/commit/d4fd34990d18adf05a10dc5e2bb4b066798280ba", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-q3m9-9fj2-mfwr \u00b7 plone/Products.isurlinportal@d4fd349 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN50804280/index.html", "ref_desc": "JVN#50804280: Plone vulnerable to open redirectThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/plone/Products.isurlinportal/security/advisories/GHSA-q3m9-9fj2-mfwr", "ref_desc": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in Products.isurlinportal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 plone/Products.isurlinportal \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
