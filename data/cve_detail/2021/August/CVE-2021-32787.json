{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32787", "Description": "Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph before version 3.30.0 has two potential information leaks. The site-admin area can be accessed by regular users and all information and features are properly protected except for daily usage statistics and code intelligence uploads and indexes. It is not possible to alter the information, nor interact with any other features in the site-admin area. The issue is patched in version 3.30.0, where the information cannot be accessed by unprivileged users. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32787", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSourcegraph\u00bbSourcegraphVersions  before (<) 3.30.0cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:sourcegraph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-mq5p-477h-xgwv", "ref_desc": "Low risk information disclosure in Sourcegraph \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/commit/6e51f4546368d959a1f9f173d16e5f20c55deb56", "ref_desc": "security: check site admin before returning site usage stats (#23026) \u00b7 sourcegraph/sourcegraph@6e51f45 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
