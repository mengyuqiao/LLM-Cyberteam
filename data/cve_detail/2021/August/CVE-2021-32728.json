{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32728", "Description": "The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32728", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbDesktopVersions  before (<) 3.3.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.86%  0.45%  -0.41 \n 2  2024-09-20  0.61%  0.86%  +0.25 \n 3  2024-09-04  0.43%  0.61%  +0.18 \n 4  2023-11-10  0.21%  0.43%  +0.22 \n 5  2023-03-11  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-f5fr-5gcv-6cc5", "ref_desc": "End-to-end encryption device setup did not verify public key \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/3338", "ref_desc": "check e2ee public key against private one by mgallien \u00b7 Pull Request #3338 \u00b7 nextcloud/desktop \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1189162", "ref_desc": "Sign inExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QCX4HqU5hP3f3KjKjmkViDIbN4s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4974", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4974-1 nextcloud-desktopThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YMdoieyemZPAGY4Cuina2Tac0ec.html"}]}
