{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-38194", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the ark-r1cs-std crate before 0.3.1 for Rust. It does not enforce any constraints in the FieldVar::mul_by_inverse method. Thus, a prover can produce a proof that is unsound but is nonetheless verified.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38194", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArcworks\u00bbArk-r1cs-std\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.3.1cpe:2.3:a:arcworks:ark-r1cs-std:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.40%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-12-11  0.27%  0.33%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-06-30  0.28%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-04-23  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-03-14  0.21%  0.25%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0075.html", "ref_desc": "RUSTSEC-2021-0075: ark-r1cs-std: Flaw in `FieldVar::mul_by_inverse` allows unsound R1CS constraint systems \u203a RustSec Advisory DatabaseExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustsec/advisory-db/main/crates/ark-r1cs-std/RUSTSEC-2021-0075.md", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
