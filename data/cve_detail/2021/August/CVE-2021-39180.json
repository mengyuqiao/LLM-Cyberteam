{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39180", "Description": "OpenOLAT is a web-based learning management system (LMS). A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39180", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nFrentix\u00bbOpenolatVersions  from including (>=) 15.4.0andbefore (<) 15.5.3cpe:2.3:a:frentix:openolat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrentix\u00bbOpenolatVersions  before (<) 15.3.18cpe:2.3:a:frentix:openolat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.25%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-02-27  0.30%  0.30%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-21  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-22  0.22%  0.29%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-04-08  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-24  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.22%  -1.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/commit/699490be8e931af0ef1f135c55384db1f4232637", "ref_desc": "OO-5549: fix the wiki import and add some unit tests \u00b7 OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT@699490b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/commit/2cf73c972e23ccd69cc1e103e43c2c8253571d3e", "ref_desc": "OO-5549: replace the wildfly assert by a junit one \u00b7 OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT@2cf73c9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.openolat.org/browse/OO-5549", "ref_desc": "Log in - OpenOlat Issue ManagementPermissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/commit/5668a41ab3f1753102a89757be013487544279d5", "ref_desc": "OO-5549: check parent by unzip \u00b7 OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT@5668a41 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/security/advisories/GHSA-x95v-2pgj-9x8j", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal in Archive Handling Leading to Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
