{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32780", "Description": "Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions Envoy transitions a H/2 connection to the CLOSED state when it receives a GOAWAY frame without any streams outstanding. The connection state is transitioned to DRAINING when it receives a SETTING frame with the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameter set to 0. Receiving these two frames in the same I/O event results in abnormal termination of the Envoy process due to invalid state transition from CLOSED to DRAINING. A sequence of H/2 frames delivered by an untrusted upstream server will result in Denial of Service in the presence of untrusted **upstream** servers. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4 contain fixes to stop processing of pending H/2 frames after connection transition to the CLOSED state.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32780", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.18.0andbefore (<) 1.18.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoy\u00bbVersion:1.19.0cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:1.19.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-09  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-30  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-17  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.19.0/version_history/version_history", "ref_desc": "Version history \u2014 envoy tag-v1.19.0 documentationVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6ElgLISX3BA0RkKLLl01YJu8KPE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-j374-mjrw-vvp8", "ref_desc": "Incorrect handling of H/2 GOAWAY followed by SETTINGS frames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hzk5gC40-NtkxEXzoeWWLHH76l0.html"}]}
