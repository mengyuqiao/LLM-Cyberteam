{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32811", "Description": "Zope is an open-source web application server. Zope versions prior to versions 4.6.3 and 5.3 have a remote code execution security issue. In order to be affected, one must use Python 3 for one's Zope deployment, run Zope 4 below version 4.6.3 or Zope 5 below version 5.3, and have the optional `Products.PythonScripts` add-on package installed. By default, one must have the admin-level Zope \"Manager\" role to add or edit Script (Python) objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web are at risk. Zope releases 4.6.3 and 5.3 are not vulnerable. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing Script (Python) objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in Zope.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32811", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andbefore (<) 4.6.3cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.3cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbAccesscontrolVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.2cpe:2.3:a:zope:accesscontrol:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbAccesscontrolVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andbefore (<) 4.3cpe:2.3:a:zope:accesscontrol:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.29%  1.46%  +0.17 \n 2  2024-10-03  0.91%  1.29%  +0.38 \n 3  2024-01-15  0.88%  0.91%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-24  0.64%  0.88%  +0.25 \n 5  2023-03-10  0.61%  0.64%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.61%  -3.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-915 Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/915/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Dynamically-Determined.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-g4gq-j4p2-j8fr", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via Script (Python) objects under Python 3 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via unsafe classes in otherwise permitted modules \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/AccessControl \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8f_q4vcshYMy6V66a05LDJzvUtU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/commit/f72a18dda8e9bf2aedb46168761668464a4be988", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-g4gq-j4p2-j8fr \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope@f72a18d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
