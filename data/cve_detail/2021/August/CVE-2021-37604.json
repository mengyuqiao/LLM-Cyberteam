{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37604", "Description": "In version 6.5 of Microchip MiWi software and all previous versions including legacy products, there is a possibility of frame counters being validated/updated prior to the message authentication. With this vulnerability in place, an attacker may increment the incoming frame counter values by injecting messages with a sufficiently large frame counter value and invalid payload. This results in denial of service/valid packets in the network. There is also a possibility of a replay attack in the stack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37604", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMicrochip\u00bbMiwi\u00bbVersion:6.5cpe:2.3:a:microchip:miwi:6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-20  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-11  0.17%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-02-14  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.17%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/wireless-connectivity/sub-ghz/miwi-protocol", "ref_desc": "MiWi\u2122 Protocol | Microchip TechnologyVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/b2r_2_PI-Cgiwzpa-3cmWmAkmlE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.microchip.com/product-change-notifications/#/", "ref_desc": "Product Change Notifications | MicrochipVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CJSFTTmDI-4RU1WzEsHN4hI19es.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/libraries-code-examples-and-more/advanced-software-framework-for-sam-devices#Downloads", "ref_desc": "Advanced Software Framework (ASF) for SAM Devices | Microchip TechnologyVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pcve_d0d3AaCJNLzlV_c3j8Dqgo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/asf-release-notes-3.50.0.100-readme.pdf", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YRw2TYMoQ2GgaFfhuWkpr1n0JRA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/wireless-connectivity/software-vulnerability-response/miwi-software-vulnerability", "ref_desc": "MiWi\u2122 Software Vulnerability | Microchip TechnologyVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZpUgSc5QNgLmXiBFsFbrby3z-mU.html"}]}
