{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-38085", "Description": "The Canon TR150 print driver through 3.71.2.10 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue. During the add printer process, a local attacker can overwrite CNMurGE.dll and, if timed properly, the overwritten DLL will be loaded into a SYSTEM process resulting in escalation of privileges. This occurs because the driver drops a world-writable DLL into a CanonBJ %PROGRAMDATA% location that gets loaded by printisolationhost (a system process).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38085", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCanon\u00bbPixma Tr150 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.71.2.10cpe:2.3:o:canon:pixma_tr150_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Canon\u00bbPixma Tr150\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.86%  0.05%  -1.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdesswZYz-8", "ref_desc": "DEF CON 29 - Jacob Baines - Bring Your Own Print Driver Vulnerability - YouTubeExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://defcon.org/html/defcon-29/dc-29-speakers.html#baines", "ref_desc": "DEF\u00a0CON\u00ae 29 Hacking Conference - SpeakersThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163795/Canon-TR150-Driver-3.71.2.10-Privilege-Escalation.html", "ref_desc": "Canon TR150 Driver 3.71.2.10 Privilege Escalation \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacob-baines/vuln_disclosure/main/vuln_2021_03.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
