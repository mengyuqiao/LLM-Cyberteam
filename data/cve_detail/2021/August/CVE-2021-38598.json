{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-38598", "Description": "OpenStack Neutron before 16.4.1, 17.x before 17.1.3, and 18.0.0 allows hardware address impersonation when the linuxbridge driver with ebtables-nft is used on a Netfilter-based platform. By sending carefully crafted packets, anyone in control of a server instance connected to the virtual switch can impersonate the hardware addresses of other systems on the network, resulting in denial of service or in some cases possibly interception of traffic intended for other destinations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38598", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpenstack\u00bbNeutronVersions  before (<) 16.4.1cpe:2.3:a:openstack:neutron:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbNeutronVersions  from including (>=) 17.0.0andbefore (<) 17.1.3cpe:2.3:a:openstack:neutron:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenstack\u00bbNeutron\u00bbVersion:18.0.0cpe:2.3:a:openstack:neutron:18.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-08  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-29  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-16  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1938670", "ref_desc": "Bug #1938670 \u201c[OSSA-2021-004] Linuxbridge ARP filter bypass on N...\u201d : Bugs : neutronExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
