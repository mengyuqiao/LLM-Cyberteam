If a low-privileged account is able to access the server running the Windows containers, it can lead to a full container compromise in both process isolation and Hyper-V isolation modes. This security issue leads an attacker with low privilege to read, write and possibly even execute code inside the containers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37841", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDocker\u00bbDesktop\u00bb     WindowsEditionVersions  before (<) 3.6.0cpe:2.3:a:docker:desktop:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/", "ref_desc": "Docker Desktop for Windows Stable Release notes | Docker DocumentationRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zRK1wYJJmUONYgghsYMTYX-ywUU.html"}]}
