{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36157", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Grafana Cortex through 1.9.0. The header value X-Scope-OrgID is used to construct file paths for rules files, and if crafted to conduct directory traversal such as ae ../../sensitive/path/in/deployment pathname, then Cortex will attempt to parse a rules file at that location and include some of the contents in the error message. (Other Cortex API requests can also be sent a malicious OrgID header, e.g., tricking the ingester into writing metrics to a different location, but the effect is nuisance rather than information disclosure.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36157", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbCortexVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:cortex:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.11%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-04-18  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-09  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-01-30  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/", "ref_desc": "Release notes | Grafana LabsRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4375", "ref_desc": "Restrict path segments in TenantIDs (CVE-2021-36157) by simonswine \u00b7 Pull Request #4375 \u00b7 cortexproject/cortex \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
