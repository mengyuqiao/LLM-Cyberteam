{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34707", "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the application does not sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to an API request. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific API request to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34707", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEvolved Programmable Network ManagerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:evolved_programmable_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-27  0.09%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 2  2023-07-20  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-12  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.09%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-epnm-info-disc-PjTZ5r6C", "ref_desc": "Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager Sensitive Information Disclosure VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
