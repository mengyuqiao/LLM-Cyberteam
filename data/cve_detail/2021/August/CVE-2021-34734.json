{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34734", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation for the Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper management of memory resources, referred to as a double free. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34734", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbVideo Surveillance 7000 Ip Camera Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.12.4cpe:2.3:o:cisco:video_surveillance_7000_ip_camera_firmware:2.12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-415 Double Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/415/Double-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipcamera-lldp-dos-OFP7j9j", "ref_desc": "Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras Link Layer Discovery Protocol Double-Free Denial of Service VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
