{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39172", "Description": "Cachet is an open source status page system. Prior to version 2.5.1, authenticated users, regardless of their privileges (User or Admin), can exploit a new line injection in the configuration edition feature (e.g. mail settings) and gain arbitrary code execution on the server. This issue was addressed in version 2.5.1 by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and preventing the use of new lines characters in new configuration values. As a workaround, only allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39172", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCatchethq\u00bbCatchetVersions  before (<) 2.5.1cpe:2.3:a:catchethq:catchet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.91% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.75%  0.91%  +0.17 \n 2  2024-09-29  0.53%  0.75%  +0.22 \n 3  2024-08-30  0.37%  0.53%  +0.16 \n 4  2024-08-15  0.36%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-07-19  0.26%  0.36%  +0.10 \n 6  2023-11-19  0.20%  0.26%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-05-17  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-04-18  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-04-04  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-03-20  0.14%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  21.90%  0.14%  -21.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-93 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/93/Improper-Neutralization-of-CRLF-Sequences-CRLF-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxw-cfrh-jxq6", "ref_desc": "New line injection during configuration edition \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fiveai/Cachet \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/releases/tag/v2.5.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.5.1 \u00b7 fiveai/Cachet \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pvfSW2RADa1NrSkRo2nAAS7oOD8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/", "ref_desc": "Cachet 2.4: Code Execution via Laravel Configuration InjectionExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vZ5Uc9LsoWwAYlhmSl7EBBgSn8Q.html"}]}
