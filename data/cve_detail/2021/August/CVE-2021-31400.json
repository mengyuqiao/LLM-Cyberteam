{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-31400", "Description": "An issue was discovered in tcp_pulloutofband() in tcp_in.c in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. The TCP out-of-band urgent-data processing function invokes a panic function if the pointer to the end of the out-of-band data points outside of the TCP segment's data. If the panic function hadn't a trap invocation removed, it will enter an infinite loop and therefore cause DoS (continuous loop or a device reset).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31400", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nHcc-embedded\u00bbNichestackVersions  before (<) 4.3cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:nichestack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-04  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-12  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-operational-technology-vulnerabilities-found-on-nichestack/", "ref_desc": "New Critical Operational Technology Vulnerabilities Found on NicheStack \u2013 Mitigation Advised - ForescoutMitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/l5uwnaCYRQud8WLr0TbcpZCwhfg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/608209", "ref_desc": "VU#608209 - NicheStack embedded TCP/IP has vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o7Oo5HR02rJwxvQI3KfwFDiR7PU.html"}]}
