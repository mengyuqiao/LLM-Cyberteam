A potential heap buffer overflow exists in the code that parses the HTTP POST request, due to an incorrect signed integer comparison. This vulnerability requires the attacker to send a malformed HTTP packet with a negative Content-Length, which bypasses the size checks and results in a large heap overflow in the wbs_multidata buffer copy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31227", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nHcc-embedded\u00bbNichestackVersions  before (<) 4.3cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:nichestack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-04  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-25  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-12  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-operational-technology-vulnerabilities-found-on-nichestack/", "ref_desc": "New Critical Operational Technology Vulnerabilities Found on NicheStack \u2013 Mitigation Advised - ForescoutMitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/l5uwnaCYRQud8WLr0TbcpZCwhfg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/608209", "ref_desc": "VU#608209 - NicheStack embedded TCP/IP has vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o7Oo5HR02rJwxvQI3KfwFDiR7PU.html"}]}
