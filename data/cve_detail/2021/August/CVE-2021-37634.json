{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37634", "Description": "Leafkit is a templating language with Swift-inspired syntax. Versions prior to 1.3.0 are susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This affects anyone passing unsanitised data to Leaf's variable tags. Before this fix, Leaf would not escape any strings passed to tags as variables. If an attacker managed to find a variable that was rendered with their unsanitised data, they could inject scripts into a generated Leaf page, which could enable XSS attacks if other mitigations such as a Content Security Policy were not enabled. This has been patched in 1.3.0. As a workaround sanitize any untrusted input before passing it to Leaf and enable a CSP to block inline script and CSS data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37634", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nVapor\u00bbLeafkitVersions  before (<) 1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:vapor:leafkit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-04-24  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-15  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit-ghsa-rv3x-xq3r-8j9h/pull/1", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit/security/advisories/GHSA-rv3x-xq3r-8j9h", "ref_desc": "LeafKit allows XSS with untrusted user input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vapor/leaf-kit \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
