{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34716", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the root user. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain crafted software images that are uploaded to the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system as an administrative user and then uploading specific crafted software images to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34716", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Video Communication ServerVersions  from including (>=) x8.6andup to, including, (<=) x14.0.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_video_communication_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbExpresswayVersions  from including (>=) x8.6.0andbefore (<) x14.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:expressway:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-10  0.16%  0.23%  +0.08 \n 2  2023-08-03  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-26  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-11  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.13%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-460 Improper Cleanup on Thrown Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/460/Improper-Cleanup-on-Thrown-Exception.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewrce-QPynNCjh", "ref_desc": "Cisco Expressway Series and TelePresence Video Communication Server Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
