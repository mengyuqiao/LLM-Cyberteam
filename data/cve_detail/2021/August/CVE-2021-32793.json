{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32793", "Description": "Pi-hole's Web interface provides a central location to manage a Pi-hole instance and review performance statistics. Prior to Pi-hole Web interface version 5.5.1, the function to add domains to blocklists or allowlists is vulnerable to a stored cross-site-scripting vulnerability. User input added as a wildcard domain to a blocklist or allowlist is unfiltered in the web interface. Since the payload is stored permanently as a wildcard domain, this is a persistent XSS vulnerability. A remote attacker can therefore attack administrative user accounts through client-side attacks. Pi-hole Web Interface version 5.5.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32793", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPi-hole\u00bbPi-holeVersions  before (<) 5.5.1cpe:2.3:a:pi-hole:pi-hole:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/security/advisories/GHSA-g3w6-q4fg-p8x8", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS Vulnerability in the Pi-hole Webinterface \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pi-hole/AdminLTE \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/releases/tag/v5.5.1", "ref_desc": "Release Pi-hole web v5.5.1 \u00b7 pi-hole/AdminLTE \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Qat962drzUvn266ljdwSW6AO1LY.html"}]}
