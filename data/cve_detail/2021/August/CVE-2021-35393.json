{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-35393", "Description": "Realtek Jungle SDK version v2.x up to v3.4.14B provides a 'WiFi Simple Config' server that implements both UPnP and SSDP protocols. The binary is usually named wscd or mini_upnpd and is the successor to miniigd. The server is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that is present due to unsafe parsing of the UPnP SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE Callback header. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote unauthenticated attackers to gain arbitrary code execution on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35393", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nRealtek\u00bbRealtek Jungle SdkVersions  from including (>=) 2.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.4.14bcpe:2.3:a:realtek:realtek_jungle_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "5.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-19  4.34%  5.19%  +0.85 \n 2  2024-12-17  3.34%  4.34%  +1.00 \n 3  2024-10-17  3.15%  3.34%  +0.19 \n 4  2024-07-22  2.13%  3.15%  +1.02 \n 5  2024-07-08  1.51%  2.13%  +0.62 \n 6  2024-05-01  1.00%  1.51%  +0.51 \n 7  2024-03-22  1.05%  1.00%  -0.05 \n 8  2023-11-08  0.88%  1.05%  +0.17 \n 9  2023-06-05  0.90%  0.88%  -0.02 \n 10  2023-04-07  0.90%  0.90%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-03-24  0.92%  0.90%  -0.01 \n 12  2023-03-09  0.90%  0.92%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-03-07  5.63%  0.90%  -4.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.realtek.com/images/safe-report/Realtek_APRouter_SDK_Advisory-CVE-2021-35392_35395.pdf", "ref_desc": "Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0HGudCW1Q1YFN4cIE-Tz5BRklQ4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.iot-inspector.com/blog/advisory-multiple-issues-realtek-sdk-iot-supply-chain", "ref_desc": "Advisory: Multiple Issues in Realtek SDK Affects Hundreds of Thousands of Devices Down the Supply Chain - IoT InspectorExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TaJhjHpJKBTP7n0PmqOHEDMzKHM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.realtek.com/en/cu-1-en/cu-1-taiwan-en", "ref_desc": "Taiwan Headquarters - REALTEKPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TJDkJcM_ZDFaTOCjGOoLjYQ1CUQ.html"}]}
