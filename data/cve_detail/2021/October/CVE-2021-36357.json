{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36357", "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenPOWER 2.6 firmware. unpack_timestamp() calls le32_to_cpu() for endian conversion of a uint16_t \"year\" value, resulting in a type mismatch that can truncate a higher integer value to a smaller one, and bypass a timestamp check. The fix is to use the right endian conversion function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36357", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenpowerfoundation\u00bbSkiboot\u00bbVersion:2.6cpe:2.3:o:openpowerfoundation:skiboot:2.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.19%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-21  0.22%  0.22%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-07  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-15  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-04  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-681 Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/681/Incorrect-Conversion-between-Numeric-Types.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-power/skiboot/commit/5be38b672c1410e2f10acd3ad2eecfdc81d5daf7", "ref_desc": "secvar: fix endian conversion \u00b7 open-power/skiboot@5be38b6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
