{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41186", "Description": "Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files to help unify logging infrastructure. The parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available. Either don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41186", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFluentd\u00bbFluentdVersions  from including (>=) 0.14.14andup to, including, (<=) 1.14.1cpe:2.3:a:fluentd:fluentd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-14  0.13%  0.25%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-06-04  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-05-09  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-06-06  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-22  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-04-11  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/securitylab-vulnerabilities/blob/52dc4a2a828c6dc24231967c2937ad92038184a9/vendor_reports/GHSL-2021-102-fluent-fluentd.md", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1142", "ref_desc": "fluentd/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 fluent/fluentd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/security/advisories/GHSA-hwhf-64mh-r662", "ref_desc": "ReDoS vulnerability in parser_apache2 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fluent/fluentd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
