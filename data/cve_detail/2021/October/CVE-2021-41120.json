{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41120", "Description": "sylius/paypal-plugin is a paypal plugin for the Sylius development platform. In affected versions the URL to the payment page done after checkout was created with autoincremented payment id (/pay-with-paypal/{id}) and therefore it was easy to predict. The problem is that the Credit card form has prefilled \"credit card holder\" field with the Customer's first and last name and hence this can lead to personally identifiable information exposure. Additionally, the mentioned form did not require authentication. The problem has been patched in Sylius/PayPalPlugin 1.2.4 and 1.3.1. If users are unable to update they can override a sylius_paypal_plugin_pay_with_paypal_form route and change its URL parameters to (for example) {orderToken}/{paymentId}, then override the Sylius\\PayPalPlugin\\Controller\\PayWithPayPalFormAction service, to operate on the payment taken from the repository by these 2 values. It would also require usage of custom repository method. Additionally, one could override the @SyliusPayPalPlugin/payWithPaypal.html.twig template, to add contingencies: ['SCA_ALWAYS'] line in hostedFields.submit(...) function call (line 421). It would then have to be handled in the function callback.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41120", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSylius\u00bbPaypal\u00bbForSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0andbefore (<) 1.3.1cpe:2.3:a:sylius:paypal:*:*:*:*:*:sylius:*:*Matching versions\nSylius\u00bbPaypal\u00bbForSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.2.4cpe:2.3:a:sylius:paypal:*:*:*:*:*:sylius:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.27%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.18%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-11  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-15  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-28  0.16%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-18  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/security/advisories/GHSA-25fx-mxc2-76g7", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized access to Credit card form exposing payer name and not requiring 3DS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sylius/PayPalPlugin \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/commit/814923c2e9d97fe6279dcee866c34ced3d2fb7a7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-25fx-mxc2-76g7 \u00b7 Sylius/PayPalPlugin@814923c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/commit/2adc46be2764ccee22b4247139b8056fb8d1afff", "ref_desc": "Require 3D Secure and process its response correctly \u00b7 Sylius/PayPalPlugin@2adc46b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
