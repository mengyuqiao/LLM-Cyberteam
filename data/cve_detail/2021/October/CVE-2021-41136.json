{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41136", "Description": "Puma is a HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. Prior to versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9, using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9. As a workaround, do not use Apache Traffic Server with `puma`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41136", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.3.8cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.5.0cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.13%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-01-04  0.12%  0.25%  +0.12 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/08/msg00015.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3083-1] puma security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1O3ARVuqopWVFaDvdkiisesdmrQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-48w2-rm65-62xx", "ref_desc": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling') in puma \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 puma/puma \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-28", "ref_desc": "Puma: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-28) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IAfZDRuzfP64ie10FFULDfZcOAk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5146", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5146-1 pumaThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/t2pPAp92xk3_XlwU4IMiC6gFQIE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/acdc3ae571dfae0e045cf09a295280127db65c7f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-48w2-rm65-62xx \u00b7 puma/puma@acdc3ae \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
