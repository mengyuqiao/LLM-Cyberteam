{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41128", "Description": "Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41128", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHygeia Project\u00bbHygeiaVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.30.4cpe:2.3:a:hygeia_project:hygeia:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-02  0.24%  0.34%  +0.10 \n 2  2023-05-28  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-14  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-29  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.21%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jshmrtn/hygeia/commit/d917f27432fe84e1c9751222ae55bae36a4dce60", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8pwv-jhj2-2369 \u00b7 jshmrtn/hygeia@d917f27 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/pull/104", "ref_desc": "Encode Formulas to prevent CSV injection by maennchen \u00b7 Pull Request #104 \u00b7 beatrichartz/csv \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jshmrtn/hygeia/security/advisories/GHSA-8pwv-jhj2-2369", "ref_desc": "CSV Injection Vulnerability on Exports \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jshmrtn/hygeia \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/beatrichartz/csv/issues/103", "ref_desc": "Encode Formulas to prevent CSV injection \u00b7 Issue #103 \u00b7 beatrichartz/csv \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection", "ref_desc": "CSV Injection Software Attack | OWASP FoundationThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
