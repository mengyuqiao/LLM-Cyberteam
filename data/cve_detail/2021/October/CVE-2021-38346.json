{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-38346", "Description": "The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress allowed authenticated users to upload executable files to a location of their choice using the brizy_create_block_screenshot AJAX action. The file would be named using the id parameter, which could be prepended with \"../\" to perform directory traversal, and the file contents were populated via the ibsf parameter, which would be base64-decoded and written to the file. While the plugin added a .jpg extension to all uploaded filenames, a double extension attack was still possible, e.g. a file named shell.php would be saved as shell.php.jpg, and would be executable on a number of common configurations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38346", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nBrizy\u00bbBrizy-page BuilderVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.3.11cpe:2.3:a:brizy:brizy-page_builder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.10%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-04-10  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-05-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-27  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/10/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-brizy-page-builder-plugin-allow-site-takeover/", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities in Brizy Page Builder Plugin Allow Site TakeoverThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hdgW4XEMw1g7gXDtrqueSxOJtFM.html"}]}
