{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41124", "Description": "Scrapy-splash is a library which provides Scrapy and JavaScript integration. In affected versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash 0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth), instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth). Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41124", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nZyte\u00bbScrapy-splashVersions  before (<) 0.8.0cpe:2.3:a:zyte:scrapy-splash:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-11  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-28  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-18  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/commit/2b253e57fe64ec575079c8cdc99fe2013502ea31", "ref_desc": "Implement SPLASH_USER and SPLASH_PASS \u00b7 scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash@2b253e5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/security/advisories/GHSA-823f-cwm9-4g74", "ref_desc": "Splash authentication credentials potentially leaked to target websites \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
