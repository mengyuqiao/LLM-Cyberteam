{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41176", "Description": "Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with PHP 7, React, and Go. In affected versions of Pterodactyl a malicious user can trigger a user logout if a signed in user visits a malicious website that makes a request to the Panel's sign-out endpoint. This requires a targeted attack against a specific Panel instance, and serves only to sign a user out. **No user details are leaked, nor is any user data affected, this is simply an annoyance at worst.** This is fixed in version 1.6.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41176", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nPterodactyl\u00bbPanelVersions  before (<) 1.6.3cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:panel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-05-31  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-05-05  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-18  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-04-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/45999ba4ee1b2dcb12b4a2fa2cedfb6b5d66fac2", "ref_desc": "(security) use POST for logout rather than GET \u00b7 pterodactyl/panel@45999ba \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-m49f-hcxp-6hm6", "ref_desc": "CSRF allowing an external page to trigger a user logout event \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/panel \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/tag/v1.6.3", "ref_desc": "Release v1.6.3 \u00b7 pterodactyl/panel \u00b7 GitHubProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
