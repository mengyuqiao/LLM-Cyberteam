{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41092", "Description": "Docker CLI is the command line interface for the docker container runtime. A bug was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker login my-private-registry.example.com` with a misconfigured configuration file (typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing a `credsStore` or `credHelpers` that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials being sent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private registry. This bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. For users unable to update ensure that any configured credsStore or credHelpers entries in the configuration file reference an installed credential helper that is executable and on the PATH.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41092", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDocker\u00bbCommand Line InterfaceVersions  before (<) 20.10.9cpe:2.3:a:docker:command_line_interface:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-19  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-10  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-04-14  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-27  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-17  0.11%  0.10%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.11%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-222547.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7GlGCtCzjVoInXg7nQDvLXlS-q4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/docker/cli/commit/893e52cf4ba4b048d72e99748e0f86b2767c6c6b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2 from moby/cli-ghsa-99pg-grm5-qq3v-default-authc\u2026 \u00b7 docker/cli@893e52c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/B5Q6G6I4W5COQE25QMC7FJY3I3PAYFBB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: moby-engine-20.10.9-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JIiexwMqlVpv1TtzlUT-V46lWNc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/docker/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-99pg-grm5-qq3v", "ref_desc": "Docker CLI leaks private registry credentials to registry-1.docker.io \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 docker/cli \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZNFADTCHHYWVM6W4NJ6CB4FNFM2VMBIB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: moby-engine-20.10.9-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XTh_y5K6IBBjck_7IDSDAo5zYyQ.html"}]}
