{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34743", "Description": "A vulnerability in the application integration feature of Cisco Webex Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to authorize an external application to integrate with and access a user's account without that user's express consent. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user who is currently authenticated to Cisco Webex Software to follow a link designed to pass malicious input to the Cisco Webex Software application authorization interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco Webex Software to authorize an application on the user's behalf without the express consent of the user, possibly allowing external applications to read data from that user's profile.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34743", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Meetings\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-24  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-13  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2023-04-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-2FmKd7T", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Software Application Authorization Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
