{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41151", "Description": "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. In affected versions A malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where Scaffolder Tasks are run. The attack is executed by crafting a custom Scaffolder template with a `github:publish:pull-request` action and a particular source path. When the template is executed the sensitive files would be included in the published pull request. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to create and register templates in the Backstage catalog, and that the attack is very visible given that the exfiltration happens via a pull request. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.15.9` release of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41151", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbBackstageVersions  from including (>=) 0.9.4andbefore (<) 0.15.9cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:backstage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-11  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-pvv8-8fx9-h673", "ref_desc": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/6968962c920508eae19a4c1c200fa2c8980a4006", "ref_desc": "scaffolder-backend: release path traversal fix \u00b7 backstage/backstage@6968962 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
