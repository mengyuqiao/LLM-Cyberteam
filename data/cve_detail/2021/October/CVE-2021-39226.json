{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39226", "Description": "Grafana is an open source data visualization platform. In affected versions unauthenticated and authenticated users are able to view the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /dashboard/snapshot/:key, or /api/snapshots/:key. If the snapshot \"public_mode\" configuration setting is set to true (vs default of false), unauthenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal path: /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Regardless of the snapshot \"public_mode\" setting, authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, or /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. The combination of deletion and viewing enables a complete walk through all snapshot data while resulting in complete snapshot data loss. This issue has been resolved in versions 8.1.6 and 7.5.11. If for some reason you cannot upgrade you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, /dashboard/snapshot/:key, and /api/snapshots/:key. They have no normal function and can be disabled without side effects.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39226", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.1.6cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  before (<) 7.5.11cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  90.72%  96.23%  +5.51 \n 2  2024-12-06  91.02%  90.72%  -0.30 \n 3  2024-10-22  91.19%  91.02%  -0.17 \n 4  2024-09-23  91.18%  91.19%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-09-10  91.06%  91.18%  +0.12 \n 6  2024-08-13  90.97%  91.06%  +0.09 \n 7  2024-06-29  97.10%  90.97%  -6.12 \n 8  2024-06-20  97.21%  97.10%  -0.11 \n 9  2024-05-11  97.24%  97.21%  -0.03 \n 10  2024-04-15  97.21%  97.24%  +0.03 \n 11  2024-03-06  97.18%  97.21%  +0.03 \n 12  2024-02-07  92.99%  97.18%  +4.19 \n 13  2023-10-02  93.95%  92.99%  -0.96 \n 14  2023-09-22  97.26%  93.95%  -3.32 \n 15  2023-04-28  97.33%  97.26%  -0.07 \n 16  2023-03-18  97.30%  97.33%  +0.03 \n 17  2023-03-07  1.18%  97.30%  +96.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/05/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-39226 Grafana snapshot authentication bypassMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/2d456a6375855364d098ede379438bf7f0667269", "ref_desc": "Fix static path matching issue in macaron \u00b7 grafana/grafana@2d456a6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-8-1-6/", "ref_desc": "Release notes for Grafana 8.1.6 | Grafana LabsRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-69j6-29vr-p3j9", "ref_desc": "Snapshot authentication bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E6ANHRDBXQT6TURLP2THM26ZPDINFBEG/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: grafana-7.5.11-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-7-5-11/", "ref_desc": "404 Page not found | Grafana LabsRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211029-0008/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-39226 Grafana Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DCKBFUSY6V4VU5AQUYWKISREZX5NLQJT/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: grafana-7.5.11-1.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
