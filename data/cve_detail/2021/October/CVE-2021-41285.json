{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41285", "Description": "Ballistix MOD Utility through 2.0.2.5 is vulnerable to privilege escalation in the MODAPI.sys driver component. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific IOCTL request that allows low-privileged users to directly interact with physical memory via the MmMapIoSpace function call (mapping physical memory into a virtual address space). Attackers could exploit this issue to achieve local privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41285", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMicron\u00bbBallistix Memory Overview Display UtilityVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.2.5cpe:2.3:a:micron:ballistix_memory_overview_display_utility:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/VoidSec/Exploit-Development/blob/master/windows/x64/kernel/crucial_Ballistix_MOD_Utility_v.2.0.2.5/crucial_Ballistix_MOD_Utility_v.2.0.2.5_memory_dump_PoC.cpp", "ref_desc": "Exploit-Development/crucial_Ballistix_MOD_Utility_v.2.0.2.5_memory_dump_PoC.cpp at master \u00b7 VoidSec/Exploit-Development \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://voidsec.com/crucial-mod-utility-lpe-cve-2021-41285/", "ref_desc": "Crucial\u2019s MOD Utility LPE - CVE-2021-41285 - VoidSecExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
