{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41171", "Description": "eLabFTW is an open source electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. In versions of eLabFTW before 4.1.0, it allows attackers to bypass a brute-force protection mechanism by using many different forged PHPSESSID values in HTTP Cookie header. This issue has been addressed by implementing brute force login protection, as recommended by Owasp with Device Cookies. This mechanism will not impact users and will effectively thwart any brute-force attempts at guessing passwords. The only correct way to address this is to upgrade to version 4.1.0. Adding rate limitation upstream of the eLabFTW service is of course a valid option, with or without upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41171", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElabftw\u00bbElabftwVersions  before (<) 4.1.0cpe:2.3:a:elabftw:elabftw:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.73% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.17%  1.73%  -0.45 \n 2  2024-11-24  2.20%  2.17%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-10-25  1.56%  2.20%  +0.64 \n 4  2024-05-16  1.11%  1.56%  +0.46 \n 5  2024-01-26  1.17%  1.11%  -0.07 \n 6  2023-12-16  0.83%  1.17%  +0.34 \n 7  2023-11-05  1.15%  0.83%  -0.32 \n 8  2023-10-07  0.48%  1.15%  +0.67 \n 9  2023-07-12  0.37%  0.48%  +0.11 \n 10  2023-06-27  0.32%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-06-13  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 12  2023-05-30  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 13  2023-05-15  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 14  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.22%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/commit/8e92afeec4c3a68dc88333881b7e6307f425706b", "ref_desc": "Add JWT anti brute-force login protection (#2831) \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw@8e92afe \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/4.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release eLabFTW-4.1.0 \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/50436", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/security/advisories/GHSA-q67h-5pc3-g6jv", "ref_desc": "Bypass bruteforce protection on login form \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 elabftw/elabftw \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/www-community/Slow_Down_Online_Guessing_Attacks_with_Device_Cookies", "ref_desc": "Slow Down Online Guessing Attacks with Device Cookies | OWASPThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
