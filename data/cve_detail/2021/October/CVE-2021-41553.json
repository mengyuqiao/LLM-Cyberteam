{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41553", "Description": "In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), the Web Application in /archibus/login.axvw assign a session token that could be already in use by another user. It was therefore possible to access the application through a user whose credentials were not known, without any attempt by the testers to modify the application logic. It is also possible to set the value of the session token, client-side, simply by making an unauthenticated GET Request to the Home Page and adding an arbitrary value to the JSESSIONID field. The application, following the login, does not assign a new token, continuing to keep the inserted one, as the identifier of the entire session. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41553", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArchibus\u00bbWeb Central\u00bbVersion:21.3.3.815cpe:2.3:a:archibus:web_central:21.3.3.815:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.20%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-08  0.20%  0.12%  -0.09 \n 4  2023-04-28  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-18  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.gruppotim.it/redteam", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability Research & Advisor | Gruppo TIMThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IWMyWn1l2xYd9Klaca__AGX5aF4.html"}]}
