{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41137", "Description": "Minio is a Kubernetes native application for cloud storage. All users on release `RELEASE.2021-10-10T16-53-30Z` are affected by a vulnerability that involves bypassing policy restrictions on regular users. Normally, checkKeyValid() should return owner true for rootCreds. In the affected version, policy restriction did not work properly for users who did not have service (svc) or security token service (STS) accounts. This issue is fixed in `RELEASE.2021-10-13T00-23-17Z`. A downgrade back to release `RELEASE.2021-10-08T23-58-24Z` is available as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41137", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinio\u00bbVersion:2021-10-10t16-53-30zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:2021-10-10t16-53-30z:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.23%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-06-15  0.23%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-06-04  0.23%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-21  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-06  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-08  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13422", "ref_desc": "checkKeyValid() should return owner true for rootCreds by harshavardhana \u00b7 Pull Request #13422 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/415bbc74aacd53a120e54a663e941b1809982dbd", "ref_desc": "checkKeyValid() should return owner true for rootCreds (#13422) \u00b7 minio/minio@415bbc7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-v64v-g97p-577c", "ref_desc": "Bypassing policy restrictions on regular users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13388", "ref_desc": "fix: disallow invalid x-amz-security-token for root credentials by harshavardhana \u00b7 Pull Request #13388 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
