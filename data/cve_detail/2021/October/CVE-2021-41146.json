{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41146", "Description": "qutebrowser is an open source keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. Starting with qutebrowser v1.7.0, the Windows installer for qutebrowser registers a `qutebrowserurl:` URL handler. With certain applications, opening a specially crafted `qutebrowserurl:...` URL can lead to execution of qutebrowser commands, which in turn allows arbitrary code execution via commands such as `:spawn` or `:debug-pyeval`. Only Windows installs where qutebrowser is registered as URL handler are affected. The issue has been fixed in qutebrowser v2.4.0. The fix also adds additional hardening for potential similar issues on Linux (by adding the new --untrusted-args flag to the .desktop file), though no such vulnerabilities are known.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41146", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nQutebrowser\u00bbQutebrowserVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:qutebrowser:qutebrowser:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nQutebrowser\u00bbQutebrowserVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.4.0cpe:2.3:a:qutebrowser:qutebrowser:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.29%  0.00 \n 2  2024-09-26  0.28%  0.30%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-06  0.31%  0.28%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-05-27  0.30%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-14  0.32%  0.30%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-04-03  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.28%  -1.16 \n 8  2023-02-22  16.66%  1.44%  -15.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-641 Improper Restriction of Names for Files and Other Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/641/Improper-Restriction-of-Names-for-Files-and-Other-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/8f46ba3f6dc7b18375f7aa63c48a1fe461190430", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-41146: Add --untrusted-args to avoid argument injection \u00b7 qutebrowser/qutebrowser@8f46ba3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-vw27-fwjf-5qxm", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary command execution in qutebrowser on Windows via URL handler \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 qutebrowser/qutebrowser \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
