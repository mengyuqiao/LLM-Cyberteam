{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41179", "Description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to Nextcloud Server versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, the Two-Factor Authentication wasn't enforced for pages marked as public. Any page marked as `@PublicPage` could thus be accessed with a valid user session that isn't authenticated. This particularly affects the Nextcloud Talk application, as this could be leveraged to gain access to any private chat channel without going through the Two-Factor flow. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5 or 22.2.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41179", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbServerVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.3andbefore (<) 20.0.13cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.1andbefore (<) 21.0.5cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbServerVersions  from including (>=) 22.1.1andbefore (<) 22.2.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-04-07  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-304 Missing Critical Step in Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/304/Missing-Critical-Step-in-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1322865", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-7hvh-rc6f-px23", "ref_desc": "Two-Factor Authentication not enforced for pages marked as public \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28725", "ref_desc": "Remove 2FA exemption from PublicPage annotation by LukasReschke \u00b7 Pull Request #28725 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
