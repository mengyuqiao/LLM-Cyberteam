{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36298", "Description": "Dell EMC InsightIQ, versions prior to 4.1.4, contain risky cryptographic algorithms in the SSH component. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to authentication bypass and remote takeover of the InsightIQ. This allows an attacker to take complete control of InsightIQ to affect services provided by SSH; so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36298", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbIsilon Insightiq FirmwareVersions  before (<) 4.1.4cpe:2.3:o:dell:isilon_insightiq_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dell\u00bbIsilon Insightiq", "EPSS Score": "0.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.46%  0.63%  +0.17 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.46%  0.46%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-02  0.42%  0.46%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-12-24  0.34%  0.42%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-09-16  0.34%  0.34%  0.00 \n 6  2023-05-09  0.32%  0.34%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-04-24  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-03-14  0.26%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.26%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/000191604", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
