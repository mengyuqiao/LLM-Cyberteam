{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41115", "Description": "Zulip is an open source team chat server. In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41115", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulipVersions  before (<) 4.7cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.15%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-30  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-05-29  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-15  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-04-30  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/697/Incorrect-Comparison.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-4h36-mqfq-42jg", "ref_desc": "Regular expression denial-of-service in linkifiers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/e2d303c1bb5f538d17dc3d9134bc8858bdece781", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-41115: Use re2 for user-supplied linkifier patterns. \u00b7 zulip/zulip@e2d303c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-118-zulip-zulip/", "ref_desc": "GitHub Security Lab | Securing the world\u2019s software, togetherExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
