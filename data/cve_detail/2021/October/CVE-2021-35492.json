{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-35492", "Description": "Wowza Streaming Engine through 4.8.11+5 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust filesystem resources via the /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata vhost parameter. This is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the Virtual Host Monitoring section by requesting random virtual-host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. (Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35492", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWowza\u00bbStreaming EngineVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.8.11cpe:2.3:a:wowza:streaming_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.40%  0.36%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.31%  0.40%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-12-28  0.26%  0.31%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-05-27  0.22%  0.26%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-05-13  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-28  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  6.51%  0.19%  -6.32 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wowza.com/docs/wowza-streaming-engine-4-8-14-release-notes", "ref_desc": "Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.14 Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fE_eT3AK2w3TGpIo8jpoA0xCs78.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gruppotim.it/redteam", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability Research & Advisor | Gruppo TIMExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IWMyWn1l2xYd9Klaca__AGX5aF4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/wowza-streaming-engine-i/", "ref_desc": "Wowza Streaming Engine - Multiple Vulnerabilities - The Tales of N4nj0Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OWRrvK_x-xFvjpYvYDs56BojV60.html"}]}
