{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40116", "Description": "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in Snort rules that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the Block with Reset or Interactive Block with Reset actions if a rule is configured without proper constraints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP packet to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause through traffic to be dropped. Note: Only products with Snort3 configured and either a rule with Block with Reset or Interactive Block with Reset actions configured are vulnerable. Products configured with Snort2 are not vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40116", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.0andbefore (<) 6.4.0.13cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  from including (>=) 6.7.0andbefore (<) 6.7.0.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  from including (>=) 6.6.0andbefore (<) 6.6.5.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Firewall Management Center\u00bbVersion:3.1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_firewall_management_center:3.1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSnort\u00bbSnortVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0.0andbefore (<) 3.1.0.100cpe:2.3:a:snort:snort:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-12  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-02  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-20  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-09  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-241 Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/241/Improper-Handling-of-Unexpected-Data-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-dos-RywH7ezM", "ref_desc": "Multiple Cisco Products Snort Rule Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
