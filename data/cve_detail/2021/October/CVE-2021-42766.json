{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-42766", "Description": "The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Ethereum consensus protocol through 2021-10-19 allows an adversary to cause a denial of service (long-range consensus chain reorganizations), even when this adversary has little stake and cannot influence network message propagation. This can cause a protocol stall, or an increase in the profits of individual validators.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42766", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nProof-of-stake Ethereum Project\u00bbProof-of-stake EthereumVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2021-10-19cpe:2.3:a:proof-of-stake_ethereum_project:proof-of-stake_ethereum:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-07-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-13  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-02  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10086", "ref_desc": "[2110.10086] Three Attacks on Proof-of-Stake EthereumThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hL47m-bp3l06RlGU8q8EzLJhI7s.html"}]}
