The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of the email parameter before using it to construct LDAP queries. An attacker could bypass authentication exploiting this vulnerability by sending login attempts in which there is a valid password but a wildcard character in email parameter.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37933", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHuntflow\u00bbHuntflow EnterpriseVersions  before (<) 3.10.6cpe:2.3:a:huntflow:huntflow_enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.19%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.21%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-05-20  0.21%  0.21%  0.00 \n 4  2023-05-07  0.28%  0.21%  -0.07 \n 5  2023-03-27  0.26%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.26%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/andrey-lomtev/cbf12bc8d8763996cf8d6d1641a0b049", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-37933 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
