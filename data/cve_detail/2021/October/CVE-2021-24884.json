{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24884", "Description": "The Formidable Form Builder WordPress plugin before 4.09.05 allows to inject certain HTML Tags like <audio>,<video>,<img>,<a> and<button>.This could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exploit a HTML-injection byinjecting a malicous link. The HTML-injection may trick authenticated users to follow the link. If the Link gets clicked, Javascript code can be executed. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the \"data-frmverify\" tag for links in the web-based entry inspection page of affected systems. A successful exploitation incomibantion with CSRF could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user. These actions include stealing the users account by changing their password or allowing attackers to submit their own code through an authenticated user resulting in Remote Code Execution. If an authenticated user who is able to edit Wordpress PHP Code in any kind, clicks the malicious link, PHP code can be edited.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24884", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nStrategy11\u00bbFormidable Form Builder\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 4.09.05cpe:2.3:a:strategy11:formidable_form_builder:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.48%  1.55%  -2.93 \n 2  2024-09-30  3.04%  4.48%  +1.43 \n 3  2024-09-16  2.17%  3.04%  +0.87 \n 4  2024-07-10  2.42%  2.17%  -0.25 \n 5  2024-05-31  2.54%  2.42%  -0.12 \n 6  2024-04-08  2.45%  2.54%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-08-14  2.51%  2.45%  -0.06 \n 8  2023-06-16  1.80%  2.51%  +0.71 \n 9  2023-06-02  1.29%  1.80%  +0.51 \n 10  2023-05-18  1.28%  1.29%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-04-07  1.30%  1.28%  -0.02 \n 12  2023-03-07  37.92%  1.30%  -36.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/b57dacdd-43c2-48f8-ac1e-eb8306b22533", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/S1lkys/XSS-in-Formidable-4.09.04/blob/main/XSS-in-Formidable-4.09.04.pdf", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-24884/XSS-in-Formidable-4.09.04.pdf at main \u00b7 S1lkys/CVE-2021-24884 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Strategy11/formidable-forms/pull/335/files", "ref_desc": "Avoid XSS from data-verify / data-caution attributes by Crabcyborg \u00b7 Pull Request #335 \u00b7 Strategy11/formidable-forms \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
