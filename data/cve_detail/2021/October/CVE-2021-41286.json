{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41286", "Description": "Omikron MultiCash Desktop 4.00.008.SP5 relies on a client-side authentication mechanism. When a user logs into the application, the validity of the password is checked locally. All communication to the database backend is made via the same technical account. Consequently, an attacker can attach a debugger to the process or create a patch that manipulates the behavior of the login function. When the function always returns the success value (corresponding to a correct password), an attacker can login with any desired account, such as the administrative account of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41286", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOmikron\u00bbMulticash\u00bbVersion:4.00.008UpdateSP5cpe:2.3:a:omikron:multicash:4.00.008:sp5:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-28  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2021-047.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
