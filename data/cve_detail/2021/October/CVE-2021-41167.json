{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41167", "Description": "modern-async is an open source JavaScript tooling library for asynchronous operations using async/await and promises. In affected versions a bug affecting two of the functions in this library: forEachSeries and forEachLimit. They should limit the concurrency of some actions but, in practice, they don't. Any code calling these functions will be written thinking they would limit the concurrency but they won't. This could lead to potential security issues in other projects. The problem has been patched in 1.0.4. There is no workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41167", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nModern-async Project\u00bbModern-async\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.0.4cpe:2.3:a:modern-async_project:modern-async:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.21%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-07-05  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-05-26  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-01-12  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-06-11  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-28  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-05-13  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-04-02  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nicolas-van/modern-async/commit/0010d28de1b15d51db3976080e26357fa7144436", "ref_desc": "Fix #5 \u00b7 nicolas-van/modern-async@0010d28 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nicolas-van/modern-async/issues/5", "ref_desc": "forEachLimit is ignoring the concurrent paramter \u00b7 Issue #5 \u00b7 nicolas-van/modern-async \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nicolas-van/modern-async/security/advisories/GHSA-3pcq-34w5-p4g2", "ref_desc": "forEachSeries and forEachLimit do not limit the number of requests \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nicolas-van/modern-async \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
