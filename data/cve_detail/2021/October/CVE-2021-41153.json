{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41153", "Description": "The evm crate is a pure Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. In `evm` crate `< 0.31.0`, `JUMPI` opcode's condition is checked after the destination validity check. However, according to Geth and OpenEthereum, the condition check should happen before the destination validity check. This is a **high** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate for Ethereum mainnet. In this case, you should update your library dependency immediately to on or after `0.31.0`. This is a **low** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate in Frontier or in a standalone blockchain, because there's no security exploit possible with this advisory. It is **not** recommended to update to on or after `0.31.0` until all the normal chain upgrade preparations have been done. If you use Frontier or other `pallet-evm` based Substrate blockchain, please ensure to update your `spec_version` before updating this. For other blockchains, please make sure to follow a hard-fork process before you update this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41153", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEvm Project\u00bbEVM\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.31.0cpe:2.3:a:evm_project:evm:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-03  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-05-11  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-31  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/security/advisories/GHSA-pvh2-pj76-4m96", "ref_desc": "Specification non-compliance in JUMPI \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-blockchain/evm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/pull/67", "ref_desc": "Fix Ethereum non-compliance in JUMPI by sorpaas \u00b7 Pull Request #67 \u00b7 rust-blockchain/evm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
