{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41145", "Description": "FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. FreeSWITCH prior to version 1.10.7 is susceptible to Denial of Service via SIP flooding. When flooding FreeSWITCH with SIP messages, it was observed that after a number of seconds the process was killed by the operating system due to memory exhaustion. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash any FreeSWITCH instance by flooding it with SIP messages, leading to Denial of Service. The attack does not require authentication and can be carried out over UDP, TCP or TLS. This issue was patched in version 1.10.7.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41145", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFreeswitch\u00bbFreeswitchVersions  before (<) 1.10.7cpe:2.3:a:freeswitch:freeswitch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-10  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-31  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-18  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-04-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/security/advisories/GHSA-jvpq-23v4-gp3m", "ref_desc": "FreeSWITCH susceptible to Denial of Service via SIP flooding \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/releases/tag/v1.10.7", "ref_desc": "Release FreeSWITCH v1.10.7 Release \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/j9o6ZOP0BVrpPgEnYvubEqIrTa0.html"}]}
