{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1585", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) Launcher could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a user's operating system. This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper signature verification for specific code exchanged between the ASDM and the Launcher. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a man-in-the-middle position on the network to intercept the traffic between the Launcher and the ASDM and then inject arbitrary code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's operating system with the level of privileges assigned to the ASDM Launcher. A successful exploit may require the attacker to perform a social engineering attack to persuade the user to initiate communication from the Launcher to the ASDM.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1585", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security Device ManagerVersions  before (<) 7.18.1.152cpe:2.3:a:cisco:adaptive_security_device_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  7.49%  7.11%  -0.38 \n 2  2024-11-25  8.10%  7.49%  -0.61 \n 3  2024-11-10  6.82%  8.10%  +1.28 \n 4  2024-06-12  4.93%  6.82%  +1.89 \n 5  2024-05-29  6.67%  4.93%  -1.74 \n 6  2024-03-22  4.45%  6.67%  +2.23 \n 7  2024-02-25  4.22%  4.45%  +0.23 \n 8  2024-02-11  4.22%  4.22%  -0.01 \n 9  2024-01-17  4.26%  4.22%  -0.04 \n 10  2023-12-21  4.69%  4.26%  -0.43 \n 11  2023-04-27  4.77%  4.69%  -0.08 \n 12  2023-03-28  5.07%  4.77%  -0.30 \n 13  2023-03-07  46.46%  5.07%  -41.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/08/11/rapid7-discovered-vulnerabilities-in-cisco-asa-asdm-and-firepower-services-software/", "ref_desc": "Rapid7 Discovered Vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, ASDM, and FirePOWER | Rapid7 BlogExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1z8UVf-SNG1tAv3GzpRKO_GI8as.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asdm-rce-gqjShXW", "ref_desc": "Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jbaines-r7/staystaystay", "ref_desc": "GitHub - jbaines-r7/staystaystay: Proof of Concept for CVE-2021-1585: Cisco ASA Device Manager RCEExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
