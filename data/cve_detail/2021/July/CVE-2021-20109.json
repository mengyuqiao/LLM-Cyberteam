{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20109", "Description": "Due to the Asset Explorer agent not validating HTTPS certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20109", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nZohocorp\u00bbManageengine Assetexplorer\u00bbVersion:1.0.34cpe:2.3:a:zohocorp:manageengine_assetexplorer:1.0.34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.14%  -0.19 \n 2  2024-04-03  0.29%  0.33%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-02-23  0.25%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.25%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-30", "ref_desc": "Manage Engine Heap Overflow POST payload - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
