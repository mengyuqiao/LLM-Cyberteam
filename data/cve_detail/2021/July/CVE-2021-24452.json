{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24452", "Description": "The W3 Total Cache WordPress plugin before 2.1.5 was affected by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the \"extension\" parameter in the Extensions dashboard, when the 'Anonymously track usage to improve product quality' setting is enabled, as the parameter is output in a JavaScript context without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker, who can convince an authenticated admin into clicking a link, to run malicious JavaScript within the user's web browser, which could lead to full site compromise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24452", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBoldgrid\u00bbW3 Total Cache\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.1.5cpe:2.3:a:boldgrid:w3_total_cache:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-03  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-20  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/3e855e09-056f-45b5-89a9-d644b7d8c9d0", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
