{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32763", "Description": "OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32763", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpenproject\u00bbOpenprojectVersions  before (<) 11.3.3cpe:2.3:a:openproject:openproject:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/9447.patch", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-qqvp-j6gm-q56f", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service in OpenProject forum messages \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opf/openproject \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
