{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32764", "Description": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. In Discourse versions 2.7.5 and prior, parsing and rendering of YouTube Oneboxes can be susceptible to XSS attacks. This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourse's default Content Security Policy. The issue is patched in `stable` version 2.7.6, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta3, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta3. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32764", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.7.5cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:2.8.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:2.8.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-9x4c-29xg-56hw", "ref_desc": "YouTube Onebox susceptible to XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
