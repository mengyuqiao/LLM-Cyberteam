{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32733", "Description": "Nextcloud Text is a collaborative document editing application that uses Markdown. A cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. The Nextcloud Text application shipped with Nextcloud server used a `text/html` Content-Type when serving files to users. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. The issue was fixed in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. As a workaround, use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32733", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 19.0.13cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.0andbefore (<) 20.0.11cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.0andbefore (<) 21.0.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-27  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-01-21  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/text/pull/1689", "ref_desc": "Use text/plain as content type for fetching the document by juliushaertl \u00b7 Pull Request #1689 \u00b7 nextcloud/text \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1241460", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-x4w3-jhcr-57pq", "ref_desc": "XSS in Nextcloud Text application \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
