{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24386", "Description": "The WP SVG images WordPress plugin before 3.4 did not sanitise the SVG files uploaded, which could allow low privilege users such as author+ to upload a malicious SVG and then perform XSS attacks by inducing another user to access the file directly. In v3.4, the plugin restricted such upload to editors and admin, with an option to also allow author to do so. The description of the plugin has also been updated with a security warning as upload of such content is intended.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24386", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nKubiq\u00bbWp Svg Images\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 3.4cpe:2.3:a:kubiq:wp_svg_images:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/e9b48b19-14cc-41ad-a029-f7f9ae236e4e", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
