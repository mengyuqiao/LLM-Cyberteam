{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32753", "Description": "EdgeX Foundry is an open source project for building a common open framework for internet-of-things edge computing. A vulnerability exists in the Edinburgh, Fuji, Geneva, and Hanoi versions of the software. When the EdgeX API gateway is configured for OAuth2 authentication and a proxy user is created, the client_id and client_secret required to obtain an OAuth2 authentication token are set to the username of the proxy user. A remote network attacker can then perform a dictionary-based password attack on the OAuth2 token endpoint of the API gateway to obtain an OAuth2 authentication token and use that token to make authenticated calls to EdgeX microservices from an untrusted network. OAuth2 is the default authentication method in EdgeX Edinburgh release. The default authentication method was changed to JWT in Fuji and later releases. Users should upgrade to the EdgeX Ireland release to obtain the fix. The OAuth2 authentication method is disabled in Ireland release. If unable to upgrade and OAuth2 authentication is required, users should create OAuth2 users directly using the Kong admin API and forgo the use of the `security-proxy-setup` tool to create OAuth2 users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32753", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nEdgexfoundry\u00bbEdgex FoundryVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:edgexfoundry:edgex_foundry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-24  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/oauth2/#create-a-consumer", "ref_desc": "OAuth 2.0 Authentication plugin | KongThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go/security/advisories/GHSA-xph4-vmcc-52gh", "ref_desc": "Weak password in API gateway in EdgeX Foundry Edinburgh, Fuji, Geneva, and Hanoi releases allows remote attackers to obtain authentication token via dictionary-based password attack when OAuth2 authenThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
