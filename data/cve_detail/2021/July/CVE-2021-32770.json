{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32770", "Description": "Gatsby is a framework for building websites. The gatsby-source-wordpress plugin prior to versions 4.0.8 and 5.9.2 leaks .htaccess HTTP Basic Authentication variables into the app.js bundle during build-time. Users who are not initializing basic authentication credentials in the gatsby-config.js are not affected. A patch has been introduced in gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.8 and gatsby-source-wordpress@5.9.2 which mitigates the issue by filtering all variables specified in the `auth: { }` section. Users that depend on this functionality are advised to upgrade to the latest release of gatsby-source-wordpress, run `gatsby clean` followed by a `gatsby build`. One may manually edit the app.js file post-build as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32770", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGatsbyjs\u00bbGatsby-source-wordpress\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.0.8cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby-source-wordpress:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nGatsbyjs\u00bbGatsby-source-wordpress\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.9.2cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby-source-wordpress:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.43% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.38%  0.43%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-17  0.31%  0.38%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-06-06  0.31%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.28%  0.31%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-03-30  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-02-19  0.21%  0.25%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/security/advisories/GHSA-rqjw-p5vr-c695", "ref_desc": "Basic-auth app bundle credential exposure in gatsby-source-wordpress \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gatsbyjs/gatsby \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
