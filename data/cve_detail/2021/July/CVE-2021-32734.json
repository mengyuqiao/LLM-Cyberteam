{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32734", "Description": "Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. In versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.011, and 21.0.3, the Nextcloud Text application shipped with Nextcloud Server returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. The issue was fixed in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. As a workaround, one may disable the Nextcloud Text application in Nextcloud Server app settings.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32734", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 19.0.13cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.0andbefore (<) 20.0.11cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.0andbefore (<) 21.0.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 2  2024-03-27  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-16  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-01-21  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.11%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/text/pull/1695", "ref_desc": "Log exceptions that happen on unknown exception and return generic messages by juliushaertl \u00b7 Pull Request #1695 \u00b7 nextcloud/text \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1246721", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-17) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jZHo9JiHBzcYnpiDroWdMBiDUSQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-6hf5-c2c4-2526", "ref_desc": "File path disclosure of shared files in Nextcloud Text application \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
