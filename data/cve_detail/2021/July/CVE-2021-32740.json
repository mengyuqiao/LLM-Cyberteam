{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32740", "Description": "Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32740", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAddressable Project\u00bbAddressable\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.8.0cpe:2.3:a:addressable_project:addressable:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-21  0.16%  0.25%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-02-10  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-15  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.13%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WYPVOOQU7UB277UUERJMCNQLRCXRCIQ5/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: rubygem-addressable-2.7.0-5.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sporkmonger/addressable/commit/0d8a3127e35886ce9284810a7f2438bff6b43cbc", "ref_desc": "Adding note about ReDoS vulnerability \u00b7 sporkmonger/addressable@0d8a312 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sporkmonger/addressable/security/advisories/GHSA-jxhc-q857-3j6g", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service in Addressable templates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sporkmonger/addressable \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SDFQM2NHNAZ3NNUQZEJTYECYZYXV4UDS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: rubygem-addressable-2.7.0-5.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
