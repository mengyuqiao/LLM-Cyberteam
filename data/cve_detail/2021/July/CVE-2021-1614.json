{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1614", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packet handling function of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to information stored in MPLS buffer memory. This vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of malformed MPLS packets that are processed by a device that is running Cisco SD-WAN Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted MPLS packet to an affected device that is running Cisco SD-WAN Software or Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1614", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 19.2.0andbefore (<) 19.2.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 20.3andbefore (<) 20.3.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 20.4andbefore (<) 20.4.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 20.5andbefore (<) 20.5.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  from including (>=) 18.4.0andbefore (<) 18.4.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-24  0.17%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-05  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-25  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.15%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-126 Buffer Over-read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/126/Buffer-Over-read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-mpls-infodisclos-MSSRFkZq", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN Software Information Disclosure VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
