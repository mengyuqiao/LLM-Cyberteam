{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32796", "Description": "xmldom is an open source pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core) DOMParser and XMLSerializer module. xmldom versions 0.6.0 and older do not correctly escape special characters when serializing elements removed from their ancestor. This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. This issue has been resolved in version 0.7.0. As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32796", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXmldom Project\u00bbXmldom\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.7.0cpe:2.3:a:xmldom_project:xmldom:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-04-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-02  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-02-05  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-91 XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/91/XML-Injection-aka-Blind-XPath-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/security/advisories/GHSA-5fg8-2547-mr8q", "ref_desc": "Misinterpretation of malicious XML input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xmldom/xmldom \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/commit/7b4b743917a892d407356e055b296dcd6d107e8b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5fg8-2547-mr8q \u00b7 xmldom/xmldom@7b4b743 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mattermost.com/blog/coordinated-disclosure-go-xml-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "Coordinated disclosure of XML round-trip vulnerabilities in Go libraryNot Applicable;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XUJGHZdboJD6MS7q6eoKIEFkpiE.html"}]}
