{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32785", "Description": "mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. When mod_auth_openidc versions prior to 2.4.9 are configured to use an unencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`, `OIDCSessionType server-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly performed argument interpolation before passing Redis requests to `hiredis`, which would perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled format string bug. Initial assessment shows that this bug does not appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but can reliably provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers. This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed before use when this option is enabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32785", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbCloud Backup\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:cloud_backup:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenidc\u00bbMod Auth OpenidcVersions  before (<) 2.4.9cpe:2.3:a:openidc:mod_auth_openidc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apache\u00bbHttp Server", "EPSS Score": "0.55% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.75%  0.55%  -0.20 \n 2  2024-08-08  0.53%  0.75%  +0.22 \n 3  2024-04-06  0.44%  0.53%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-02-26  0.43%  0.44%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-01-31  0.23%  0.43%  +0.21 \n 6  2024-01-18  0.22%  0.23%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-05-08  0.32%  0.22%  -0.09 \n 8  2023-05-01  0.24%  0.32%  +0.08 \n 9  2023-04-11  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-13  0.16%  0.23%  +0.07 \n 11  2023-03-07  2.40%  0.16%  -2.24 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-134 Use of Externally-Controlled Format String", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/134/Use-of-Externally-Controlled-Format-String.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00034.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3409-1] libapache2-mod-auth-openidc security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-xRduW72OuDPFlBCimIwzm6TyFM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6asgpQiuGkU8TMiXi_ZmgQDbjR8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/releases/tag/v2.4.9", "ref_desc": "Release release 2.4.9 \u00b7 zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/A95j5_O0AEZ3fjxJ1IstvOFQUp0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-55r8-6w97-xxr4", "ref_desc": "Format string bug in the Redis cache implementation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210902-0001/", "ref_desc": "July 2021 Apache HTTP Server Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Qu_buFcqZxqgRkHA7rcvjFUPNe4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/commit/dc672688dc1f2db7df8ad4abebc367116017a449", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-55r8-6w97-xxr4 \u00b7 zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc@dc67268 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
