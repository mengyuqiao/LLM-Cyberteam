{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32807", "Description": "The module `AccessControl` defines security policies for Python code used in restricted code within Zope applications. Restricted code is any code that resides in Zope's object database, such as the contents of `Script (Python)` objects. The policies defined in `AccessControl` severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that are deemed safe, such as Python's `string` module. However, full access to the `string` module also allows access to the class `Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script (Python)` in a way that provides access to other unsafe Python libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries can be used for remote code execution. By default, you need to have the admin-level Zope \"Manager\" role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web - which would be a very unusual configuration to begin with - are at risk. The problem has been fixed in AccessControl 4.3 and 5.2. Only AccessControl versions 4 and 5 are vulnerable, and only on Python 3, not Python 2.7. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing `Script (Python)` objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in Zope.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32807", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nZope\u00bbAccesscontrolVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.2cpe:2.3:a:zope:accesscontrol:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbAccesscontrolVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andbefore (<) 4.3cpe:2.3:a:zope:accesscontrol:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.23%  1.38%  +0.16 \n 2  2024-09-30  0.87%  1.23%  +0.36 \n 3  2024-01-12  0.84%  0.87%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-21  0.60%  0.84%  +0.23 \n 5  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.60%  -3.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-915 Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/915/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Dynamically-Determined.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via unsafe classes in otherwise permitted modules \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/AccessControl \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8f_q4vcshYMy6V66a05LDJzvUtU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#51-2021-07-30", "ref_desc": "AccessControl/CHANGES.rst at master \u00b7 zopefoundation/AccessControl \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/commit/b42dd4badf803bb9fb71ac34cd9cb0c249262f2c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf \u00b7 zopefoundation/AccessControl@b42dd4b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
