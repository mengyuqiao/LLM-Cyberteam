{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32769", "Description": "Micronaut is a JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building JVM applications. A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.5.9. With a basic configuration, it is possible to access any file from a filesystem, using \"/../../\" in the URL. This occurs because Micronaut does not restrict file access to configured paths. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.5.9. As a workaround, do not use `**` in mapping, use only `*`, which exposes only flat structure of a directory not allowing traversal. If using Linux, another workaround is to run micronaut in chroot.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32769", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nObjectcomputing\u00bbMicronautVersions  before (<) 2.5.9cpe:2.3:a:objectcomputing:micronaut:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.26%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-06-07  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 3  2024-03-31  0.17%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-20  0.13%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/security/advisories/GHSA-cjx7-399x-p2rj", "ref_desc": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in micronaut-core \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 micronaut-projects/micronaut-core \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/commit/a0cfeb13bf1ef5d692d16d4a3b91b34b7456bb11", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-cjx7-399x-p2rj \u00b7 micronaut-projects/micronaut-core@a0cfeb1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
