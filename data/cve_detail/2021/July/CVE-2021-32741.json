{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32741", "Description": "Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. In versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.011, and 21.0.3, there was a lack of ratelimiting on the public share link mount endpoint. This may have allowed an attacker to enumerate potentially valid share tokens. The issue was fixed in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32741", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 19.0.13cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.0andbefore (<) 20.0.11cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.0andbefore (<) 21.0.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-27  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-01-21  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-799 Improper Control of Interaction Frequency", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/799/Improper-Control-of-Interaction-Frequency.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1192144", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/26958", "ref_desc": "Throttle MountPublicLinkController when share is not found by rullzer \u00b7 Pull Request #26958 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-crvj-vmf7-xrvr", "ref_desc": "Lack of ratelimit on public share link mount endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
