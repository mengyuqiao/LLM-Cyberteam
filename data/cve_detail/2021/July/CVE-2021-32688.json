{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32688", "Description": "Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. Nextcloud Server supports application specific tokens for authentication purposes. These tokens are supposed to be granted to a specific applications (e.g. DAV sync clients), and can also be configured by the user to not have any filesystem access. Due to a lacking permission check, the tokens were able to change their own permissions in versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. Thus fileystem limited tokens were able to grant themselves access to the filesystem. The issue is patched in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32688", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 19.0.13cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.0andbefore (<) 20.0.11cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.0andbefore (<) 21.0.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.22%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.24%  0.24%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.24%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/27000", "ref_desc": "Harden apptoken check by rullzer \u00b7 Pull Request #27000 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-17) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jZHo9JiHBzcYnpiDroWdMBiDUSQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1193321", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BVZS26RDME2DYTKET5AECRIZDFUGR2AZ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: nextcloud-19.0.13-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mlgPeW-glmZn-C0hqDITJ6sTvDM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-48m7-7r2r-838r", "ref_desc": "Application specific tokens can change their own scope \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J63NBVPR2AQCAWRNDOZSGRY5II4WS2CZ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: nextcloud-20.0.11-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Z7PMp4vpz75XdsPHGlMFZ0NBCmM.html"}]}
