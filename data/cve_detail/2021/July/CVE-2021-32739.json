{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32739", "Description": "Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for reporting. From version 2.4.0 through version 2.12.4, a vulnerability exists that may allow privilege escalation for authenticated API users. With a read-ony user's credentials, an attacker can view most attributes of all config objects including `ticket_salt` of `ApiListener`. This salt is enough to compute a ticket for every possible common name (CN). A ticket, the master node's certificate, and a self-signed certificate are enough to successfully request the desired certificate from Icinga. That certificate may in turn be used to steal an endpoint or API user's identity. Versions 2.12.5 and 2.11.10 both contain a fix the vulnerability. As a workaround, one may either specify queryable types explicitly or filter out ApiListener objects.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32739", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 2.12.0andbefore (<) 2.12.5cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIcinga\u00bbIcingaVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.11.10cpe:2.3:a:icinga:icinga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.58%  0.36%  -0.22 \n 2  2024-11-17  0.58%  0.58%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-17  0.41%  0.58%  +0.17 \n 4  2024-08-01  0.29%  0.41%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-07-18  0.20%  0.29%  +0.09 \n 6  2024-06-06  0.21%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-10-07  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-267 Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/267/Privilege-Defined-With-Unsafe-Actions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/security/advisories/GHSA-98wp-jc6q-x5q5", "ref_desc": "Results of queries for ApiListener objects include the ticket salt which allows in turn to steal (more privileged) identities \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Icinga/icinga2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/11/msg00010.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2816-1] icinga2 security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lKImfY1caokQKVljww_4rbTB-Hk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://icinga.com/blog/2021/07/02/releasing-icinga-2-12-5-2-11-10/", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00bb IcingaBroken Link;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
