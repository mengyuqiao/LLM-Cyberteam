{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32773", "Description": "Racket is a general-purpose programming language and an ecosystem for language-oriented programming. In versions prior to 8.2, code evaluated using the Racket sandbox could cause system modules to incorrectly use attacker-created modules instead of their intended dependencies. This could allow system functions to be controlled by the attacker, giving access to facilities intended to be restricted. This problem is fixed in Racket version 8.2. A workaround is available, depending on system settings. For systems that provide arbitrary Racket evaluation, external sandboxing such as containers limit the impact of the problem. For multi-user evaluation systems, such as the `handin-server` system, it is not possible to work around this problem and upgrading is required.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32773", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRacket-lang\u00bbRacketVersions  before (<) 8.2cpe:2.3:a:racket-lang:racket:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-03  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-441 Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/441/Unintended-Proxy-or-Intermediary-Confused-Deputy-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/racket/racket/commit/6ca4ffeca1e5877d44f835760ad89f18488d97e1", "ref_desc": "racket/sandbox: documentation and tests for reader and require checking \u00b7 racket/racket@6ca4ffe \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/racket/racket/security/advisories/GHSA-cgrw-p7p7-937c", "ref_desc": "Confused deputy attack in sandbox module resolution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 racket/racket \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
