{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32686", "Description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In PJSIP before version 2.11.1, there are a couple of issues found in the SSL socket. First, a race condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted socket having no group lock. Second, the SSL socket parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. Both issues were reported to happen intermittently in heavy load TLS connections. They cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service. These are fixed in version 2.11.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32686", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTeluu\u00bbPjsipVersions  before (<) 2.11.1cpe:2.3:a:teluu:pjsip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.78%  0.54%  -0.23 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.56%  0.78%  +0.21 \n 3  2024-04-07  0.52%  0.56%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-02-27  0.50%  0.52%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-01  0.35%  0.50%  +0.15 \n 6  2023-03-14  0.34%  0.35%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.34%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4999", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4999-1 asteriskThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/aRTFTDQrqW5c0iSNnZhiA-68uTU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/releases/tag/2.11.1", "ref_desc": "Release PJSIP version 2.11.1 \u00b7 pjsip/pjproject \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-cv8x-p47p-99wr", "ref_desc": "Race condition in SSL socket server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pjsip/pjproject \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2962-1] pjproject security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tzZjmvwh7cYT3SlKHuV_7M0D8tk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37", "ref_desc": "PJSIP: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202210-37) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/W8YpCz80ppqTEQN4vzGUJU_R0tE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/pull/2716", "ref_desc": "Race condition in SSL socket server by nanangizz \u00b7 Pull Request #2716 \u00b7 pjsip/pjproject \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/d5f95aa066f878b0aef6a64e60b61e8626e664cd", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-cv8x-p47p-99wr \u00b7 pjsip/pjproject@d5f95aa \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
