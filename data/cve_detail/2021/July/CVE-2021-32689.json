{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32689", "Description": "Nextcloud Talk is a fully on-premises audio/video and chat communication service. In versions prior to 11.2.2, if a user was able to reuse an earlier used username, they could get access to any chat message sent to the previous user with this username. The issue was patched in versions 11.2.2 and 11.3.0. As a workaround, don't allow users to choose usernames themselves. This is the default behaviour of Nextcloud, but some user providers may allow doing so.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32689", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbTalkVersions  before (<) 11.2.2cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-708 Incorrect Ownership Assignment", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/708/Incorrect-Ownership-Assignment.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/5633", "ref_desc": "Reusable user ids one to one chats by nickvergessen \u00b7 Pull Request #5633 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1200700", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-xv6f-344w-895c", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud Talk not properly disassociating users from chats after account deletion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/releases/tag/v11.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release v11.3.0 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/releases/tag/v11.2.2", "ref_desc": "Release v11.2.2 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
