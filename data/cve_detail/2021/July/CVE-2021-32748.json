{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32748", "Description": "Nextcloud Richdocuments in an open source self hosted online office. Nextcloud uses the WOPI (\"Web Application Open Platform Interface\") protocol to communicate with the Collabora Editor, the communication between these two services was not protected by a credentials or IP check. Whilst this does not result in gaining access to data that the user has not yet access to, it can result in a bypass of any enforced watermark on documents as described on the [Nextcloud Virtual Data Room](https://nextcloud.com/virtual-data-room/) website and [our documentation](https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/nextcloud-and-virtual-data-room-configuration-59.html). The Nextcloud Richdocuments releases 3.8.3 and 4.2.0 add an additional admin settings for an allowlist of IP addresses that can access the WOPI API. We recommend upgrading and configuring the allowlist to a list of Collabora servers. There is no known workaround. Note that this primarily results a bypass of any configured watermark or download protection using File Access Control. If you do not require or rely on these as a security feature no immediate action is required on your end.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32748", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbRichdocumentsVersions  before (<) 3.8.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:richdocuments:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbRichdocumentsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:richdocuments:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-13  0.08%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-24x8-h6m2-9jf2", "ref_desc": "WOPI API not protected by credentials/IP check \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/richdocuments/pull/1640", "ref_desc": "Allow to limit wopi requests to specific source hosts by juliushaertl \u00b7 Pull Request #1640 \u00b7 nextcloud/richdocuments \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1194606", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
