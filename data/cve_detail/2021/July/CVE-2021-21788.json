{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21788", "Description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the way IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate 14.2.0.220 driver handles Privileged I/O write requests. During IOCTL 0x9c40a0dc, the first dword passed in the input buffer is the device port to write to and the word at offset 4 is the value to write via the OUT instruction. The OUT instruction can write one byte to the given I/O device port, potentially leading to escalated privileges of unprivileged users. A local attacker can send a malicious IRP to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21788", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nIobit\u00bbAdvanced Systemcare Ultimate\u00bbVersion:14.2.0.220cpe:2.3:a:iobit:advanced_systemcare_ultimate:14.2.0.220:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-782 Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/782/Exposed-IOCTL-with-Insufficient-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1254", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2021-1254 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZW0V-yQ-OTSb1k8zRgJ-HisSwPE.html"}]}
