{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21291", "Description": "OAuth2 Proxy is an open-source reverse proxy and static file server that provides authentication using Providers (Google, GitHub, and others) to validate accounts by email, domain or group. In OAuth2 Proxy before version 7.0.0, for users that use the whitelist domain feature, a domain that ended in a similar way to the intended domain could have been allowed as a redirect. For example, if a whitelist domain was configured for \".example.com\", the intention is that subdomains of example.com are allowed. Instead, \"example.com\" and \"badexample.com\" could also match. This is fixed in version 7.0.0 onwards. As a workaround, one can disable the whitelist domain feature and run separate OAuth2 Proxy instances for each subdomain.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21291", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nOauth2 Proxy Project\u00bbOauth2 ProxyVersions  before (<) 7.0.0cpe:2.3:a:oauth2_proxy_project:oauth2_proxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-10-19  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-09  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-27  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/v7.0.0", "ref_desc": "Release v7.0.0 \u00b7 oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/commit/780ae4f3c99b579cb2ea9845121caebb6192f725", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-4mf2-f3wh-gvf2 \u00b7 oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy@780ae4f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-4mf2-f3wh-gvf2", "ref_desc": "Subdomain checking of whitelisted domains could allow unintended redirects \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/v7", "ref_desc": "oauth2-proxy \u00b7 pkg.go.devProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IM3ubAMqM6gHmdF0sau-DUOGmE0.html"}]}
