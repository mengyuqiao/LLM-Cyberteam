{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13580", "Description": "An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the PlanMaker document parsing functionality of SoftMaker Office 2021\u2019s PlanMaker application. A specially crafted document can cause the document parser to explicitly trust a length from a particular record type and use it to write a 16-bit null relative to a buffer allocated on the stack. Due to a lack of bounds-checking on this value, this can allow an attacker to write to memory outside of the buffer and controllably corrupt memory. This can allow an attacker to earn code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can entice the victim to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13580", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nSoftmaker\u00bbPlanmaker 2021\u00bbVersion:1014cpe:2.3:a:softmaker:planmaker_2021:1014:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.43%  0.58%  +0.15 \n 2  2024-06-09  0.40%  0.43%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-01-11  0.38%  0.40%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.39%  0.38%  0.00 \n 5  2023-09-25  0.38%  0.39%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-09-11  0.40%  0.38%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-06-23  0.44%  0.40%  -0.04 \n 8  2023-05-27  0.50%  0.44%  -0.06 \n 9  2023-04-14  0.54%  0.50%  -0.04 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.54%  -0.50 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1191", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2020-1191 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
