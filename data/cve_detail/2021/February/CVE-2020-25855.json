{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25855", "Description": "The function AES_UnWRAP() in the Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi Module prior to versions released in April 2020 (up to and excluding 2.08) does not validate the size parameter for a memcpy() operation, resulting in a stack buffer overflow which can be exploited for remote code execution or denial of service. An attacker can impersonate an Access Point and attack a vulnerable Wi-Fi client, by injecting a crafted packet into the WPA2 handshake. The attacker needs to know the network's PSK in order to exploit this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25855", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRealtek\u00bbRtl8195a FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.08cpe:2.3:o:realtek:rtl8195a_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Realtek\u00bbRtl8195a\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "1.67% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.31%  1.67%  +0.36 \n 2  2024-11-05  1.02%  1.31%  +0.29 \n 3  2024-10-21  0.78%  1.02%  +0.24 \n 4  2024-10-03  0.66%  0.78%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-06-23  0.91%  0.66%  -0.24 \n 6  2024-06-08  0.62%  0.91%  +0.29 \n 7  2024-05-22  0.91%  0.62%  -0.29 \n 8  2024-05-07  0.67%  0.91%  +0.25 \n 9  2024-04-06  0.63%  0.67%  +0.04 \n 10  2024-03-22  0.67%  0.63%  -0.05 \n 11  2024-03-08  0.63%  0.67%  +0.05 \n 12  2024-02-21  0.67%  0.63%  -0.05 \n 13  2024-02-07  0.72%  0.67%  -0.05 \n 14  2024-01-10  0.72%  0.72%  +0.00 \n 15  2023-12-27  0.60%  0.72%  +0.12 \n 16  2023-12-13  0.63%  0.60%  -0.03 \n 17  2023-11-30  0.60%  0.63%  +0.04 \n 18  2023-11-15  0.42%  0.60%  +0.18 \n 19  2023-11-03  0.56%  0.42%  -0.15 \n 20  2023-10-20  0.39%  0.56%  +0.18 \n 21  2023-09-10  0.33%  0.39%  +0.06 \n 22  2023-07-19  0.32%  0.33%  +0.01 \n 23  2023-05-08  0.26%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 24  2023-04-28  0.27%  0.26%  -0.01 \n 25  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.27%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.vdoo.com/blog/realtek-rtl8195a-vulnerabilities-discovered/", "ref_desc": "Major Vulnerabilities Discovered in Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi ModuleExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4Nxe2mWKrymbk5THoDiV5bxbGhs.html"}]}
