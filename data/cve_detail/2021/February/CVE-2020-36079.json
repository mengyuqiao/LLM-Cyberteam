{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-36079", "Description": "Zenphoto through 1.5.7 is affected by authenticated arbitrary file upload, leading to remote code execution. The attacker must navigate to the uploader plugin, check the elFinder box, and then drag and drop files into the Files(elFinder) portion of the UI. This can, for example, place a .php file in the server's uploaded/ directory. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because exploitation can only be performed by an admin who has \"lots of other possibilities to harm a site.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36079", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nZenphoto\u00bbZenphotoVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.5.7cpe:2.3:a:zenphoto:zenphoto:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.88%  2.14%  -3.74 \n 2  2024-07-01  5.83%  5.88%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-05-15  4.20%  5.83%  +1.63 \n 4  2024-04-29  4.19%  4.20%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-31  4.13%  4.19%  +0.07 \n 6  2024-02-15  3.23%  4.13%  +0.90 \n 7  2023-08-11  3.12%  3.23%  +0.11 \n 8  2023-03-07  4.57%  3.12%  -1.45 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zenphoto/zenphoto/issues/1292", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-36079 clarification needed \u00b7 Issue #1292 \u00b7 zenphoto/zenphoto \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.zenphoto.org/news/why-not-every-security-issue-is-really-an-issue/", "ref_desc": "Why not every security issue is really an issue [Updated] | ZenphotoCMS - The simpler media website CMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/161569/Zenphoto-CMS-1.5.7-Shell-Upload.html", "ref_desc": "Zenphoto CMS 1.5.7 Shell Upload \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
