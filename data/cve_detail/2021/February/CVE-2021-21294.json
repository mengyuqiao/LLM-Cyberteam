{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21294", "Description": "Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services. Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service. Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s provides a general \"MaxActiveRequests\" middleware mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new \"maxConnections\" property, with a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed altogether starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds described in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21294", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nTypelevel\u00bbHttp4sVersions  before (<) 0.21.17cpe:2.3:a:typelevel:http4s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-12-07  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-11-22  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-10-19  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-09  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-08-14  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/http4s/http4s/commit/987d6589ef79545b9bb2324ac4bdebf82d9a0171", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w \u00b7 http4s/http4s@987d658 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/http4s/http4s/security/advisories/GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w", "ref_desc": "Unbounded connection acceptance in http4s-blaze-server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 http4s/http4s \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tIT3qkwUVUnjY6apPzH7qNPbACo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/http4s/blaze/security/advisories/GHSA-xmw9-q7x9-j5qc", "ref_desc": "Unbounded connection acceptance leads to file handle exhaustion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 http4s/blaze \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/y5CMe02TMwHyTAyQDzMbCDyiil4.html"}]}
