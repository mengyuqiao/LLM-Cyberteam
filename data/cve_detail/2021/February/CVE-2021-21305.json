{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21305", "Description": "CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexible way to upload files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave before versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The \"#manipulate!\" method inappropriately evals the content of mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21305", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCarrierwave Project\u00bbCarrierwave\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 1.3.2cpe:2.3:a:carrierwave_project:carrierwave:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nCarrierwave Project\u00bbCarrierwave\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.1andbefore (<) 2.1.1cpe:2.3:a:carrierwave_project:carrierwave:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.75%  1.14%  +0.39 \n 2  2024-02-12  0.53%  0.75%  +0.22 \n 3  2023-05-03  0.41%  0.53%  +0.12 \n 4  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.41%  -4.16 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave", "ref_desc": "carrierwave | RubyGems.org | your community gem hostProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-cf3w-g86h-35x4", "ref_desc": "Code Injection vulnerability in CarrierWave::RMagick \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#132---2021-02-08", "ref_desc": "carrierwave/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nU0lXsHD6r6rYDsdF48JRc50jOw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#211---2021-02-08", "ref_desc": "carrierwave/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oQbj6QqKKZh75U1UX9w0vuCK-0U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/387116f5c72efa42bc3938d946b4c8d2f22181b7", "ref_desc": "Fix Code Injection vulnerability in CarrierWave::RMagick \u00b7 carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave@387116f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
