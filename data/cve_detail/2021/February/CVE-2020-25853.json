{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25853", "Description": "The function CheckMic() in the Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi Module prior to versions released in April 2020 (up to and excluding 2.08) does not validate the size parameter for an internal function, _rt_md5_hmac_veneer() or _rt_hmac_sha1_veneer(), resulting in a stack buffer over-read which can be exploited for denial of service. An attacker can impersonate an Access Point and attack a vulnerable Wi-Fi client, by injecting a crafted packet into the WPA2 handshake. The attacker does not need to know the network's PSK.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25853", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRealtek\u00bbRtl8195a FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.08cpe:2.3:o:realtek:rtl8195a_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Realtek\u00bbRtl8195a\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-10-20  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-10  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-126 Buffer Over-read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/126/Buffer-Over-read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.vdoo.com/blog/realtek-rtl8195a-vulnerabilities-discovered/", "ref_desc": "Major Vulnerabilities Discovered in Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi ModuleExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4Nxe2mWKrymbk5THoDiV5bxbGhs.html"}]}
