{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25837", "Description": "Cosmos Network Ethermint <= v0.4.0 is affected by cache lifecycle inconsistency in the EVM module. Due to the inconsistency between the Storage caching cycle and the Tx processing cycle, Storage changes caused by a failed transaction are improperly reserved in memory. Although the bad storage cache data will be discarded at EndBlock, it is still valid in the current block, which enables many possible attacks such as an \"arbitrary mint token\".", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25837", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nChainsafe\u00bbEthermintVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.4.0cpe:2.3:a:chainsafe:ethermint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-25  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-15  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  4.50%  0.08%  -4.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/issues/667#issuecomment-759284107", "ref_desc": "There may be bad data points in CommitStateDB when exec evm transaction with multi msgs \u00b7 Issue #667 \u00b7 cosmos/ethermint \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
