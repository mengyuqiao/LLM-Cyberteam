{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22161", "Description": "In OpenWrt 19.07.x before 19.07.7, when IPv6 is used, a routing loop can occur that generates excessive network traffic between an affected device and its upstream ISP's router. This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set. This affects the netifd and odhcp6c packages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22161", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenwrt\u00bbOpenwrtVersions  from including (>=) 19.07.0andup to, including, (<=) 19.07.6cpe:2.3:o:openwrt:openwrt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-09-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://openwrt.org/advisory/2021-02-02-1", "ref_desc": "[OpenWrt Wiki] Security Advisory 2021-02-02-1 - netifd and odhcp6c routing loop on IPv6 point to point links (CVE pending)Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
