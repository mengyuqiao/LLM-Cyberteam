{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35681", "Description": "Django Channels 3.x before 3.0.3 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from a different request scope. The legacy channels.http.AsgiHandler class, used for handling HTTP type requests in an ASGI environment prior to Django 3.0, did not correctly separate request scopes in Channels 3.0. In many cases this would result in a crash but, with correct timing, responses could be sent to the wrong client, resulting in potential leakage of session identifiers and other sensitive data. Note that this affects only the legacy Channels provided class, and not Django's similar ASGIHandler, available from Django 3.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35681", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDjangoproject\u00bbChannelsVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.3cpe:2.3:a:djangoproject:channels:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.73% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.50%  0.73%  +0.23 \n 2  2023-11-07  0.46%  0.50%  +0.05 \n 3  2023-09-28  0.38%  0.46%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.38%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releases/index.html", "ref_desc": "Release Notes \u2014 Channels 3.0.3 documentationRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/django/channels/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 django/channels \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releases/3.0.3.html", "ref_desc": "3.0.3 Release Notes \u2014 Channels 3.0.3 documentationExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
