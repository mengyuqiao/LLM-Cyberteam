{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-23331", "Description": "This affects all versions of package com.squareup:connect. The method prepareDownloadFilecreates creates a temporary file with the permissions bits of -rw-r--r-- on unix-like systems. On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between users. As such, the contents of the file downloaded by downloadFileFromResponse will be visible to all other users on the local system. A workaround fix for this issue is to set the system property java.io.tmpdir to a safe directory as remediation. Note: This version of the SDK is end of life and no longer maintained, please upgrade to the latest version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23331", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSquareup\u00bbConnect Java Software Development Kitcpe:2.3:a:squareup:connect_java_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMSQUAREUP-1065988", "ref_desc": "Insecure Temporary File in com.squareup:connect | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/square/connect-java-sdk/blob/master/src/main/java/com/squareup/connect/ApiClient.java%23L613", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
