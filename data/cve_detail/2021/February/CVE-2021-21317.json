{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21317", "Description": "uap-core in an open-source npm package which contains the core of BrowserScope's original user agent string parser. In uap-core before version 0.11.0, some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings. This is fixed in version 0.11.0. Downstream packages such as uap-python, uap-ruby etc which depend upon uap-core follow different version schemes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21317", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nUap-core Project\u00bbUap-core\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.11.0cpe:2.3:a:uap-core_project:uap-core:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.40%  0.51%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-12-06  0.33%  0.40%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-02-09  0.43%  0.33%  -0.10 \n 4  2023-11-02  0.54%  0.43%  -0.11 \n 5  2023-09-23  0.67%  0.54%  -0.13 \n 6  2023-09-11  0.33%  0.67%  +0.34 \n 7  2023-08-28  0.32%  0.33%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.32%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/uap-core", "ref_desc": "uap-core - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/commit/dc9925d458214cfe87b93e35346980612f6ae96c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-p4pj-mg4r-x6v4 \u00b7 ua-parser/uap-core@dc9925d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/security/advisories/GHSA-p4pj-mg4r-x6v4", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service in uap-core <=0.10.0 when processing crafted User-Agent strings \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ua-parser/uap-core \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
