{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21298", "Description": "Node-Red is a low-code programming for event-driven applications built using nodejs. Node-RED 1.2.7 and earlier has a vulnerability which allows arbitrary path traversal via the Projects API. If the Projects feature is enabled, a user with `projects.read` permission is able to access any file via the Projects API. The issue has been patched in Node-RED 1.2.8. The vulnerability applies only to the Projects feature which is not enabled by default in Node-RED. The primary workaround is not give untrusted users read access to the Node-RED editor.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21298", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nNodered\u00bbNode-red\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.2.8cpe:2.3:a:nodered:node-red:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-red/node-red/security/advisories/GHSA-m33v-338h-4v9f", "ref_desc": "Path traversal via Projects API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 node-red/node-red \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@node-red/runtime", "ref_desc": "@node-red/runtime - npmProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/crGtzlEcI8q9s6rCjqacvrRpW4Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-red/node-red/releases/tag/1.2.8", "ref_desc": "Release 1.2.8: Maintenance Release \u00b7 node-red/node-red \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DHv1UuN0yB7QedxZxziwl1oz75M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/node-red/node-red/commit/74db3e17d075f23d9c95d7871586cf461524c456", "ref_desc": "Restrict project file access to inside the project directory \u00b7 node-red/node-red@74db3e1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
