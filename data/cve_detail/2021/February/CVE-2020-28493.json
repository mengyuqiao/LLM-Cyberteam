{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28493", "Description": "This affects the package jinja2 from 0.0.0 and before 2.11.3. The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly due to the `_punctuation_re regex` operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The last wildcard is the most exploitable as it searches for trailing punctuation. This issue can be mitigated by Markdown to format user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing request timeouts and limiting process memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28493", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPalletsprojects\u00bbJinjaVersions  before (<) 2.11.3cpe:2.3:a:palletsprojects:jinja:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.24%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-09-08  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-04-26  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-JINJA2-1012994", "ref_desc": "SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVAKCOO7VBVUBM3Q6CBBTPBFNP5NDXF4/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: mingw-python-jinja2-2.11.3-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-19", "ref_desc": "Jinja: Denial of service (GLSA 202107-19) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/blob/ab81fd9c277900c85da0c322a2ff9d68a235b2e6/src/jinja2/utils.py%23L20", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1343", "ref_desc": "backport urlize speedup by davidism \u00b7 Pull Request #1343 \u00b7 pallets/jinja \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
