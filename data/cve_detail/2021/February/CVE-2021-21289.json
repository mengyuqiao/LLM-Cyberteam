{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21289", "Description": "Mechanize is an open-source ruby library that makes automated web interaction easy. In Mechanize from version 2.0.0 and before version 2.7.7 there is a command injection vulnerability. Affected versions of mechanize allow for OS commands to be injected using several classes' methods which implicitly use Ruby's Kernel.open method. Exploitation is possible only if untrusted input is used as a local filename and passed to any of these calls: Mechanize::CookieJar#load, Mechanize::CookieJar#save_as, Mechanize#download, Mechanize::Download#save, Mechanize::File#save, and Mechanize::FileResponse#read_body. This is fixed in version 2.7.7.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21289", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMechanize Project\u00bbMechanize\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 2.0andbefore (<) 2.7.7cpe:2.3:a:mechanize_project:mechanize:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.23%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-12-07  0.30%  0.29%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.30%  0.30%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-19  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-09  0.26%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.73%  0.26%  -2.47 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize/releases/tag/v2.7.7", "ref_desc": "Release 2.7.7 / 2021-02-01 \u00b7 sparklemotion/mechanize \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rubygems.org/gems/mechanize/", "ref_desc": "mechanize | RubyGems.org | your community gem hostProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YNFZ7ROYS6V4J5L5PRAJUG2AWC7VXR2V/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: rubygem-mechanize-2.7.7-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize/security/advisories/GHSA-qrqm-fpv6-6r8g", "ref_desc": "Command Injection Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sparklemotion/mechanize \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize/commit/66a6a1bfa653a5f13274a396a5e5441238656aa0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #548 from kyoshidajp/fix_command_injection \u00b7 sparklemotion/mechanize@66a6a1b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LBVVJUL4P4KCJH4IQTHFZ4ATXY7XXZPV/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: rubygem-mechanize-2.7.7-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/02/msg00021.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2561-1] ruby-mechanize security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-17", "ref_desc": "Mechanize: Command injection (GLSA 202107-17) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
