{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25276", "Description": "In SolarWinds Serv-U before 15.2.2 Hotfix 1, there is a directory containing user profile files (that include users' password hashes) that is world readable and writable. An unprivileged Windows user (having access to the server's filesystem) can add an FTP user by copying a valid profile file to this directory. For example, if this profile sets up a user with a C:\\ home directory, then the attacker obtains access to read or replace arbitrary files with LocalSystem privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25276", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolarwinds\u00bbServ-uVersions  before (<) 15.2.2cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:serv-u:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSolarwinds\u00bbServ-u\u00bbVersion:15.2.2cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:serv-u:15.2.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/full-system-control-with-new-solarwinds-orion-based-and-serv-u-ftp-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "Full System Control with New SolarWinds Orion-based and Serv-U FTP Vulnerabilities | TrustwaveExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CvpKxQngAP6ssZJr_sNIuJjso4A.html"}]}
