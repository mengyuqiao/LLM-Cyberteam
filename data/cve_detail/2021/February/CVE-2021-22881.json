{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22881", "Description": "The Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack before 6.1.2.1, 6.0.3.5 suffers from an open redirect vulnerability. Specially crafted `Host` headers in combination with certain \"allowed host\" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading dot. When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted `Host` header can be used to redirect to a malicious website.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22881", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRubyonrails\u00bbRailsVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.0.3.5cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRubyonrails\u00bbRailsVersions  from including (>=) 6.1.0andbefore (<) 6.1.2.1cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.26%  0.00 \n 2  2024-10-29  0.23%  0.26%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-10-28  0.21%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-18  0.18%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.18%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/20/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2021-22942] Possible Open Redirect in Host Authorization MiddlewareMailing List;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2021-22881-possible-open-redirect-in-host-authorization-middleware/77130", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2021-22881] Possible Open Redirect in Host Authorization Middleware - Security Announcements - Ruby on Rails DiscussionsMitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XQ3NS4IBYE2I3MVMGAHFZBZBIZGHXHT3/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: rubygem-actionpack-6.0.3.4-2.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0z6AMeY9ZCTkCZXun8gLssSOYdE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1047447", "ref_desc": "#1047447 HostAuthorization middleware does not suitably sanitize the Host / X-Forwarded-For header allowing redirection.Exploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://benjamin-bouchet.com/cve-2021-22881-faille-de-securite-dans-le-middleware-hostauthorization/", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2021-22881] Faille de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans le middleware HostAuthorization \u2013 Benjamin BouchetPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/05/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2021-22903] Possible Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action PackMailing List;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/14/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2021-44528] Possible Open Redirect in Host Authorization MiddlewareExploit;Mailing List;PatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yuk4522NhofEImsLOMJkSnTc5TY.html"}]}
