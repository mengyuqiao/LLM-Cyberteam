{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21318", "Description": "Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21318", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApereo\u00bbOpencastVersions  before (<) 9.2cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/b18c6a7f81f08ed14884592a6c14c9ab611ad450", "ref_desc": "Fix Engage Series Publication and Access \u00b7 opencast/opencast@b18c6a7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-vpc2-3wcv-qj4w", "ref_desc": "Removing access may not effect published series \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencast/opencast \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
