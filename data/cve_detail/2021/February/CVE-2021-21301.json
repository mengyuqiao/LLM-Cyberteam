{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21301", "Description": "Wire is an open-source collaboration platform. In Wire for iOS (iPhone and iPad) before version 3.75 there is a vulnerability where the video capture isn't stopped in a scenario where a user first has their camera enabled and then disables it. It's a privacy issue because video is streamed to the call when the user believes it is disabled. It impacts all users in video calls. This is fixed in version 3.75.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21301", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nWire\u00bbWire\u00bbForIphone OsVersions  before (<) 3.75cpe:2.3:a:wire:wire:*:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/commit/7e3c30120066c9b10e50cc0d20012d0849c33a40", "ref_desc": "[Fix] video capture state (#4879) \u00b7 wireapp/wire-ios@7e3c301 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/pull/4879", "ref_desc": "[Fix] video capture state by David-Henner \u00b7 Pull Request #4879 \u00b7 wireapp/wire-ios \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/security/advisories/GHSA-7fg4-x8vj-qvxf", "ref_desc": "Video feed was captured while user has disabled video \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wireapp/wire-ios \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
