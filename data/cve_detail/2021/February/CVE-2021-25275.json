{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25275", "Description": "SolarWinds Orion Platform before 2020.2.4, as used by various SolarWinds products, installs and uses a SQL Server backend, and stores database credentials to access this backend in a file readable by unprivileged users. As a result, any user having access to the filesystem can read database login details from that file, including the login name and its associated password. Then, the credentials can be used to get database owner access to the SWNetPerfMon.DB database. This gives access to the data collected by SolarWinds applications, and leads to admin access to the applications by inserting or changing authentication data stored in the Accounts table of the database.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25275", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolarwinds\u00bbOrion PlatformVersions  before (<) 2020.2.4cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:orion_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-08  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/full-system-control-with-new-solarwinds-orion-based-and-serv-u-ftp-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "Full System Control with New SolarWinds Orion-based and Serv-U FTP Vulnerabilities | TrustwaveExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CvpKxQngAP6ssZJr_sNIuJjso4A.html"}]}
