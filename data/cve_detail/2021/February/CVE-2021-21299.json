{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21299", "Description": "hyper is an open-source HTTP library for Rust (crates.io). In hyper from version 0.12.0 and before versions 0.13.10 and 0.14.3 there is a vulnerability that can enable a request smuggling attack. The HTTP server code had a flaw that incorrectly understands some requests with multiple transfer-encoding headers to have a chunked payload, when it should have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that understands the request payload boundary differently can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\". To determine if vulnerable, all these things must be true: 1) Using hyper as an HTTP server (the client is not affected), 2) Using HTTP/1.1 (HTTP/2 does not use transfer-encoding), 3) Using a vulnerable HTTP proxy upstream to hyper. If an upstream proxy correctly rejects the illegal transfer-encoding headers, the desync attack cannot succeed. If there is no proxy upstream of hyper, hyper cannot start the desync attack, as the client will repair the headers before forwarding. This is fixed in versions 0.14.3 and 0.13.10. As a workaround one can take the following options: 1) Reject requests that contain a `transfer-encoding` header, 2) Ensure any upstream proxy handles `transfer-encoding` correctly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21299", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHyper\u00bbHyper\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.14.0andbefore (<) 0.14.3cpe:2.3:a:hyper:hyper:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nHyper\u00bbHyper\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.12.0andbefore (<) 0.13.10cpe:2.3:a:hyper:hyper:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.32%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-12-16  0.35%  0.34%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-12-02  0.29%  0.35%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-10-28  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-18  0.26%  0.26%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-08-23  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.25%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/security/advisories/GHSA-6hfq-h8hq-87mf", "ref_desc": "Multiple Transfer-Encoding headers misinterprets request payload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hyperium/hyper \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn", "ref_desc": "HTTP Desync Attacks: Request Smuggling Reborn | PortSwigger ResearchThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7jtjVcEEvZfQ9IR-I5XiAESFj0E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://crates.io/crates/hyper", "ref_desc": "hyper - crates.io: Rust Package RegistryProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0020.html", "ref_desc": "RUSTSEC-2021-0020: hyper: Multiple Transfer-Encoding headers misinterprets request payload \u203a RustSec Advisory DatabaseThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commit/8f93123efef5c1361086688fe4f34c83c89cec02", "ref_desc": "fix(http1): fix server misinterpretting multiple Transfer-Encoding he\u2026 \u00b7 hyperium/hyper@8f93123 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
