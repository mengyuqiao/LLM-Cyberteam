{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21274", "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21274", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  from including (>=) 0.99.0andbefore (<) 1.25.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-12-16  0.17%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-11-12  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-03  0.14%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-09-07  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.14%  -0.88 \n 8  2023-02-22  4.13%  1.02%  -3.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8950", "ref_desc": "Add a maximum size for well-known lookups. by clokep \u00b7 Pull Request #8950 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.25.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.25.0 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bZThrVTO1VDTzWD3Fb0XabkgA_s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/ff5c4da1289cb5e097902b3e55b771be342c29d6", "ref_desc": "Add a maximum size for well-known lookups.
