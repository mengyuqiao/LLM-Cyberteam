{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21273", "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, requests to user provided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses when calculating the key validity for third-party invite events and sending push notifications. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user, although limited modification of request bodies was possible. For the most thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions. See the new `ip_range_blacklist` and `ip_range_whitelist` settings if more specific control is necessary.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21273", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.25.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-12-16  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-12  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-03  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-07  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/30fba6210834a4ecd91badf0c8f3eb278b72e746", "ref_desc": "Apply an IP range blacklist to push and key revocation requests.
