{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21296", "Description": "Fleet is an open source osquery manager. In Fleet before version 3.7.0 a malicious actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted request that causes the Fleet server to exit, resulting in denial of service. This is possible only while a live query is currently ongoing. We believe the impact of this vulnerability to be low given the requirement that the actor has a valid node key. There is no information disclosure, privilege escalation, or code execution. The issue is fixed in Fleet 3.7.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21296", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege;Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFleetdm\u00bbFleet\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.7.0cpe:2.3:a:fleetdm:fleet:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.09%  -2.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-xwh8-9p3f-3x45", "ref_desc": "Possible DoS by authorized nodes in live query write \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fleetdm/fleet \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/commit/f68f4238e83b45b2164e4ed05df14af0f06eaf40", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xwh8-9p3f-3x45 \u00b7 fleetdm/fleet@f68f423 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/fleetctl", "ref_desc": "fleetctl - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
