{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15097", "Description": "loklak is an open-source server application which is able to collect messages from various sources, including twitter. The server contains a search index and a peer-to-peer index sharing interface. All messages are stored in an elasticsearch index. In loklak less than or equal to commit 5f48476, a path traversal vulnerability exists. Insufficient input validation in the APIs exposed by the loklak server allowed a directory traversal vulnerability. Any admin configuration and files readable by the app available on the hosted file system can be retrieved by the attacker. Furthermore, user-controlled content could be written to any admin config and files readable by the application. This has been patched in commit 50dd692. Users will need to upgrade their hosted instances of loklak to not be vulnerable to this exploit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15097", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nLoklak Project\u00bbLoklakVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2020-01-22cpe:2.3:a:loklak_project:loklak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-10-19  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server/security/advisories/GHSA-7557-4v29-rqw6", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability - Directory Traversal Attacks in Loklak Instances \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 loklak/loklak_server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server/commit/50dd69230d3cd71dab0bfa7156682ffeca8ed8b9", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7557-4v29-rqw6 \u00b7 loklak/loklak_server@50dd692 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
