{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14312", "Description": "A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14312", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedoraVersions  before (<) 31cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-22  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-12  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1851342", "ref_desc": "1851342 \u2013 (CVE-2020-14312) CVE-2020-14312 dnsmasq: insecure default configuration makes it an open resolverIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
