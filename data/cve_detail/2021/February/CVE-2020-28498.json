{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28498", "Description": "The package elliptic before 6.5.4 are vulnerable to Cryptographic Issues via the secp256k1 implementation in elliptic/ec/key.js. There is no check to confirm that the public key point passed into the derive function actually exists on the secp256k1 curve. This results in the potential for the private key used in this implementation to be revealed after a number of ECDH operations are performed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28498", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIndutny\u00bbElliptic\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 6.5.4cpe:2.3:a:indutny:elliptic:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-12-07  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 3  2024-11-22  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-19  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-09  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-08-14  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.10%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1069836", "ref_desc": "Cryptographic Issues in org.webjars.npm:elliptic | SnykPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ELLIPTIC-1064899", "ref_desc": "SnykPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/commit/441b7428b0e8f6636c42118ad2aaa186d3c34c3f", "ref_desc": "ec: validate that a point before deriving keys \u00b7 indutny/elliptic@441b742 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/christianlundkvist/blog/blob/master/2020_05_26_secp256k1_twist_attacks/secp256k1_twist_attacks.md", "ref_desc": "blog/secp256k1_twist_attacks.md at master \u00b7 christianlundkvist/blog \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
