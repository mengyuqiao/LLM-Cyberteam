{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26299", "Description": "ftp-srv is an open-source FTP server designed to be simple yet configurable. In ftp-srv before version 4.4.0 there is a path-traversal vulnerability. Clients of FTP servers utilizing ftp-srv hosted on Windows machines can escape the FTP user's defined root folder using the expected FTP commands, for example, CWD and UPDR. When windows separators exist within the path (`\\`), `path.resolve` leaves the upper pointers intact and allows the user to move beyond the root folder defined for that user. We did not take that into account when creating the path resolve function. The issue is patched in version 4.4.0 (commit 457b859450a37cba10ff3c431eb4aa67771122e3).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26299", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nFtp-srv Project\u00bbFtp-srv\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.4.0cpe:2.3:a:ftp-srv_project:ftp-srv:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.20%  -0.14 \n 2  2024-10-28  0.29%  0.34%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-09-24  0.34%  0.29%  -0.05 \n 4  2024-01-30  0.33%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-05  0.26%  0.33%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.26%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/autovance/ftp-srv/pull/224", "ref_desc": "fix(fs): check resolved path against root by matt-forster \u00b7 Pull Request #224 \u00b7 autovance/ftp-srv \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/autovance/ftp-srv/commit/457b859450a37cba10ff3c431eb4aa67771122e3", "ref_desc": "fix(fs): check resolved path against root (#224) \u00b7 autovance/ftp-srv@457b859 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/ftp-srv", "ref_desc": "ftp-srv - npmProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EqQTDTbcCPYS2q0tOHkBKEHfEIc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/autovance/ftp-srv/issues/225", "ref_desc": "Symlink Resolution \u00b7 Discussion #225 \u00b7 autovance/ftp-srv \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/autovance/ftp-srv/issues/167", "ref_desc": "Windows: User can escape from root directory \u00b7 Issue #167 \u00b7 autovance/ftp-srv \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/autovance/ftp-srv/security/advisories/GHSA-pmw4-jgxx-pcq9", "ref_desc": "File System Bounds Escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 autovance/ftp-srv \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
