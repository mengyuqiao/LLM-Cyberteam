{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-13579", "Description": "An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists in the PlanMaker document parsing functionality of SoftMaker Office 2021\u2019s PlanMaker application. A specially crafted document can cause the document parser perform arithmetic that may overflow which can result in an undersized heap allocation. Later when copying data from the file into this allocation, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur which can corrupt memory. These types of memory corruptions can allow for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can entice the victim to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13579", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nSoftmaker\u00bbPlanmaker 2021\u00bbVersion:1014cpe:2.3:a:softmaker:planmaker_2021:1014:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.50%  0.60%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-01-11  0.48%  0.50%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-10-21  0.48%  0.48%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-09-25  0.48%  0.48%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-11  0.50%  0.48%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-06-23  0.55%  0.50%  -0.05 \n 7  2023-05-27  0.63%  0.55%  -0.08 \n 8  2023-04-14  0.83%  0.63%  -0.20 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.83%  -0.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1190", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2020-1190 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
