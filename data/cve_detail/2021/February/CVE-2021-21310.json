{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21310", "Description": "NextAuth.js (next-auth) is am open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. In next-auth before version 3.3.0 there is a token verification vulnerability. Implementations using the Prisma database adapter in conjunction with the Email provider are impacted. Implementations using the Email provider with the default database adapter are not impacted. Implementations using the Prisma database adapter but not using the Email provider are not impacted. The Prisma database adapter was checking the verification token, but was not verifying the email address associated with that token. This made it possible to use a valid token to sign in as another user when using the Prima adapter in conjunction with the Email provider. This issue is specific to the community supported Prisma adapter. This issue is fixed in version 3.3.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21310", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextauth.js\u00bbNext-auth\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.3.0cpe:2.3:a:nextauth.js:next-auth:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.51%  +0.23 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-01-04  0.23%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-10-28  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-18  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-05-06  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-auth", "ref_desc": "next-auth - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-pg53-56cg-4m8q", "ref_desc": "Insecure email token verification in Prisma adapter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextauthjs/next-auth \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/releases/tag/v3.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release v3.3.0 \u00b7 nextauthjs/next-auth \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
