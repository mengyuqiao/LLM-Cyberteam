{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20182", "Description": "A privilege escalation flaw was found in openshift4/ose-docker-builder. The build container runs with high privileges using a chrooted environment instead of runc. If an attacker can gain access to this build container, they can potentially utilize the raw devices of the underlying node, such as the network and storage devices, to at least escalate their privileges to that of the cluster admin. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20182", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 4.4andbefore (<) 4.4.33cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 4.6andbefore (<) 4.6.15cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 4.5andbefore (<) 4.5.30cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915110", "ref_desc": "1915110 \u2013 (CVE-2021-20182) CVE-2021-20182 openshift: builder allows read and write of block devicesIssue Tracking;Mitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
