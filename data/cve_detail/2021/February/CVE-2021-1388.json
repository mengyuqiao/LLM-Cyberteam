{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1388", "Description": "A vulnerability in an API endpoint of Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator (MSO) installed on the Application Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper token validation on a specific API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to receive a token with administrator-level privileges that could be used to authenticate to the API on affected MSO and managed Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1388", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbApplication Policy Infrastructure Controller\u00bbVersion:3.0(3i)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_policy_infrastructure_controller:3.0\\(3i\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbAci Multi-site OrchestratorVersions  from including (>=) 3.0andbefore (<) 3.0\\(3m\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:aci_multi-site_orchestrator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-14  2.60%  2.26%  -0.34 \n 2  2023-11-10  2.37%  2.60%  +0.24 \n 3  2023-10-28  1.68%  2.37%  +0.69 \n 4  2023-08-23  1.19%  1.68%  +0.49 \n 5  2023-05-19  0.73%  1.19%  +0.47 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.73%  -0.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-mso-authbyp-bb5GmBQv", "ref_desc": "Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator Application Services Engine Deployment Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
