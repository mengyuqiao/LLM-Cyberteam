{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-26843", "Description": "An issue was discovered in sthttpd through 2.27.1. On systems where the strcpy function is implemented with memcpy, the de_dotdot function may cause a Denial-of-Service (daemon crash) due to overlapping memory ranges being passed to memcpy. This can triggered with an HTTP GET request for a crafted filename. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2017-10671, but occurs in a different part of the de_dotdot function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26843", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSthttpd Project\u00bbSthttpdVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.27.1cpe:2.3:a:sthttpd_project:sthttpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.18%  +0.06 \n 2  2023-10-24  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-14  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/blueness/sthttpd/issues/14", "ref_desc": "Potential memory corruption/crash due to overlapping strcpy arguments \u00b7 Issue #14 \u00b7 blueness/sthttpd \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
