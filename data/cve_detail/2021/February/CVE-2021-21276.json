{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21276", "Description": "Polr is an open source URL shortener. in Polr before version 2.3.0, a vulnerability in the setup process allows attackers to gain admin access to site instances, even if they do not possess an existing account. This vulnerability exists regardless of users' settings. If an attacker crafts a request with specific cookie headers to the /setup/finish endpoint, they may be able to obtain admin privileges on the instance. This is caused by a loose comparison (==) in SetupController that is susceptible to attack. The project has been patched to ensure that a strict comparison (===) is used to verify the setup key, and that /setup/finish verifies that no users table exists before performing any migrations or provisioning any new accounts. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. Users can patch this vulnerability without upgrading by adding abort(404) to the very first line of finishSetup in SetupController.php.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21276", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPolrproject\u00bbPolrVersions  before (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:polrproject:polr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.36%  0.93%  -0.44 \n 2  2024-12-06  1.60%  1.36%  -0.23 \n 3  2024-11-21  1.57%  1.60%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-07-24  1.50%  1.57%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-06-21  1.07%  1.50%  +0.44 \n 6  2024-05-20  1.33%  1.07%  -0.26 \n 7  2024-04-04  1.87%  1.33%  -0.54 \n 8  2024-03-06  2.38%  1.87%  -0.51 \n 9  2023-12-25  2.41%  2.38%  -0.03 \n 10  2023-11-28  2.27%  2.41%  +0.14 \n 11  2023-10-18  1.98%  2.27%  +0.29 \n 12  2023-09-08  1.69%  1.98%  +0.29 \n 13  2023-08-13  1.40%  1.69%  +0.29 \n 14  2023-04-07  0.11%  1.40%  +1.29 \n 15  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr/security/advisories/GHSA-vg6w-8w9v-xxqc", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation vulnerability in setup process \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cydrobolt/polr \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr/commit/b1981709908caf6069b4a29dad3b6739c322c675", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vg6w-8w9v-xxqc \u00b7 cydrobolt/polr@b198170 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr/releases/tag/2.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release 2.3.0 \u00b7 cydrobolt/polr \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171743/POLR-URL-2.3.0-Shortener-Admin-Takeover.html", "ref_desc": "POLR URL 2.3.0 Shortener Admin Takeover \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
