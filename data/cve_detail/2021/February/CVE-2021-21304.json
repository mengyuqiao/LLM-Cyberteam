{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21304", "Description": "Dynamoose is an open-source modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. In Dynamoose from version 2.0.0 and before version 2.7.0 there was a prototype pollution vulnerability in the internal utility method \"lib/utils/object/set.ts\". This method is used throughout the codebase for various operations throughout Dynamoose. We have not seen any evidence of this vulnerability being exploited. There is no evidence this vulnerability impacts versions 1.x.x since the vulnerable method was added as part of the v2 rewrite. This vulnerability also impacts v2.x.x beta/alpha versions. Version 2.7.0 includes a patch for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21304", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDynamoosejs\u00bbDynamoose\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:dynamoosejs:dynamoose:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.51%  0.58%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-12-13  0.52%  0.51%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-11-28  0.44%  0.52%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-10-25  0.40%  0.44%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-09-15  0.39%  0.40%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-20  0.38%  0.39%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.38%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-915 Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/915/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Dynamically-Determined.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dynamoose/dynamoose/commit/324c62b4709204955931a187362f8999805b1d8e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-rrqm-p222-8ph2 \u00b7 dynamoose/dynamoose@324c62b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dynamoose/dynamoose/releases/tag/v2.7.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.7.0 \u00b7 dynamoose/dynamoose \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamoose", "ref_desc": "dynamoose - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dynamoose/dynamoose/security/advisories/GHSA-rrqm-p222-8ph2", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dynamoose/dynamoose \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
