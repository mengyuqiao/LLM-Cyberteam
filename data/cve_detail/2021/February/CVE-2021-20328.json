{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20328", "Description": "Specific versions of the Java driver that support client-side field level encryption (CSFLE) fail to perform correct host name verification on the KMS server\u2019s certificate. This vulnerability in combination with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result in interception of traffic between the Java driver and the KMS service rendering Field Level Encryption ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal testing and affects all versions of the Java driver that support CSFLE. The Java async, Scala, and reactive streams drivers are not impacted. This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported key services originating from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure network fabrics due to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does not impact driver workloads that don\u2019t use Field Level Encryption.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20328", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMongodb\u00bbJava Driver\u00bbForMongodbVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andbefore (<) 4.2.1cpe:2.3:a:mongodb:java_driver:*:*:*:*:*:mongodb:*:*Matching versions\nMongodb\u00bbJava Driver\u00bbForMongodbVersions  from including (>=) 3.12.0andbefore (<) 3.12.8cpe:2.3:a:mongodb:java_driver:*:*:*:*:*:mongodb:*:*Matching versions\nMongodb\u00bbJava Driver\u00bbForMongodbVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.0.6cpe:2.3:a:mongodb:java_driver:*:*:*:*:*:mongodb:*:*Matching versions\nMongodb\u00bbJava Driver\u00bbForMongodbVersions  from including (>=) 3.11.0andbefore (<) 3.11.3cpe:2.3:a:mongodb:java_driver:*:*:*:*:*:mongodb:*:*Matching versions\nMongodb\u00bbJava Driver\u00bbForMongodbVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.1.2cpe:2.3:a:mongodb:java_driver:*:*:*:*:*:mongodb:*:*Matching versions\nQuarkus\u00bbQuarkusVersions  before (<) 1.13.3cpe:2.3:a:quarkus:quarkus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nQuarkus\u00bbQuarkus\u00bbVersion:1.13.3cpe:2.3:a:quarkus:quarkus:1.13.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/JAVA-4017", "ref_desc": "[JAVA-4017] Fix CVE-2021-20328 - MongoDBIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
