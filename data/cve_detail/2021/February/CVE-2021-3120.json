{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-3120", "Description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium plugin before 3.3.1 for WordPress allows remote attackers to achieve remote code execution on the operating system in the security context of the web server. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to place a valid Gift Card product into the shopping cart. An uploaded file is placed at a predetermined path on the web server with a user-specified filename and extension. This occurs because the ywgc-upload-picture parameter can have a .php value even though the intention was to only allow uploads of Gift Card images.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3120", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nYithemes\u00bbYith Woocommerce Gift Cards\u00bb     PremiumEditionForWordpressVersions  before (<) 3.3.1cpe:2.3:a:yithemes:yith_woocommerce_gift_cards:*:*:*:*:premium:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "11.99% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  25.94%  11.99%  -13.94 \n 2  2024-12-12  23.71%  25.94%  +2.23 \n 3  2024-11-09  18.79%  23.71%  +4.92 \n 4  2024-06-27  17.87%  18.79%  +0.92 \n 5  2024-04-25  13.45%  17.87%  +4.42 \n 6  2023-12-04  14.33%  13.45%  -0.88 \n 7  2023-11-08  8.64%  14.33%  +5.69 \n 8  2023-09-29  7.60%  8.64%  +1.04 \n 9  2023-08-07  7.36%  7.60%  +0.24 \n 10  2023-05-17  7.07%  7.36%  +0.29 \n 11  2023-05-08  8.13%  7.07%  -1.06 \n 12  2023-03-07  2.43%  8.13%  +5.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/guy-liu/yith-giftdrop", "ref_desc": "GitHub - guy-liu/yith-giftdrop: Exploit for the Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability in YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards PremiumExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/", "ref_desc": "YITH WooCommerce Gift CardsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
