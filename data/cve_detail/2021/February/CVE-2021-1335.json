{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1335", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly. These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1335", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv082 Dual Wan Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.3.14cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv082_dual_wan_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv082 Dual Wan Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv016 Multi-wan Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.3.14cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv016_multi-wan_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv016 Multi-wan Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv042 Dual Wan Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.3.14cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv042_dual_wan_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv042 Dual Wan Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv042g Dual Gigabit Wan Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.3.14cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv042g_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv042g Dual Gigabit Wan Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv320 Dual Gigabit Wan Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.5.1.11cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv320_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv320 Dual Gigabit Wan Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv325 Dual Gigabit Wan Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.5.1.11cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv325_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv325 Dual Gigabit Wan Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  0.21%  0.30%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-04-29  0.16%  0.22%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.16%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-overflow-ghZP68yj", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Management Interface Remote Command Execution and Denial of Service VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JnMQ_r_tSlCnQRO6OQ3CfhH3Li0.html"}]}
