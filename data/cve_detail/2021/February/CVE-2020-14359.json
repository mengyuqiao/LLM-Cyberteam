{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-14359", "Description": "A vulnerability was found in all versions of Keycloak Gatekeeper, where on using lower case HTTP headers (via cURL) an attacker can bypass our Gatekeeper. Lower case headers are also accepted by some webservers (e.g. Jetty). This means there is no protection when we put a Gatekeeper in front of a Jetty server and use lowercase headers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14359", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbLouketo Proxycpe:2.3:a:redhat:louketo_proxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-11-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-01  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-305 Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/305/Authentication-Bypass-by-Primary-Weakness.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-14090", "ref_desc": "Log In | Red Hat IDPIssue Tracking;Permissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1868591", "ref_desc": "1868591 \u2013 (CVE-2020-14359) CVE-2020-14359 keycloak: gatekeeper bypass via cURL when using lower case HTTP headersIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
