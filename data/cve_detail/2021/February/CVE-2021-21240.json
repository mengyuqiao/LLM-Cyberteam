{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21240", "Description": "httplib2 is a comprehensive HTTP client library for Python. In httplib2 before version 0.19.0, a malicious server which responds with long series of \"\\xa0\" characters in the \"www-authenticate\" header may cause Denial of Service (CPU burn while parsing header) of the httplib2 client accessing said server. This is fixed in version 0.19.0 which contains a new implementation of auth headers parsing using the pyparsing library.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21240", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nHttplib2 Project\u00bbHttplib2\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 0.19.0cpe:2.3:a:httplib2_project:httplib2:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.31%  -0.06 \n 2  2023-10-25  0.23%  0.36%  +0.14 \n 3  2023-09-15  0.19%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-05-03  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.15%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/httplib2", "ref_desc": "httplib2 \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/security/advisories/GHSA-93xj-8mrv-444m", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS) in httplib2 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 httplib2/httplib2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/pull/182", "ref_desc": "parse auth headers using pyparsing instead of regexp by temoto \u00b7 Pull Request #182 \u00b7 httplib2/httplib2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/commit/bd9ee252c8f099608019709e22c0d705e98d26bc", "ref_desc": "parse auth headers using pyparsing instead of regexp \u00b7 httplib2/httplib2@bd9ee25 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
