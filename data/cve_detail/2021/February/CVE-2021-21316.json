{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21316", "Description": "less-openui5 is an npm package which enables building OpenUI5 themes with Less.js. In less-openui5 before version 0.10., when processing theming resources (i.e. `*.less` files) with less-openui5 that originate from an untrusted source, those resources might contain JavaScript code which will be executed in the context of the build process. While this is a feature of the Less.js library it is an unexpected behavior in the context of OpenUI5 and SAPUI5 development. Especially in the context of UI5 Tooling which relies on less-openui5. An attacker might create a library or theme-library containing a custom control or theme, hiding malicious JavaScript code in one of the .less files. Refer to the referenced GHSA-3crj-w4f5-gwh4 for examples. Starting with Less.js version 3.0.0, the Inline JavaScript feature is disabled by default. less-openui5 however currently uses a fork of Less.js v1.6.3. Note that disabling the Inline JavaScript feature in Less.js versions 1.x, still evaluates code has additional double codes around it. We decided to remove the inline JavaScript evaluation feature completely from the code of our Less.js fork. This fix is available in less-openui5 version 0.10.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21316", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLess-openui5 Project\u00bbLess-openui5\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.10.0cpe:2.3:a:less-openui5_project:less-openui5:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-12-06  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-02  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-23  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-08-28  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5/releases/tag/v0.10.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.10.0 \u00b7 SAP/less-openui5 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5/security/advisories/GHSA-3crj-w4f5-gwh4", "ref_desc": "Processing untrusted theming resources might execute arbitrary code (ACE) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 SAP/less-openui5 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/less-openui5", "ref_desc": "less-openui5 - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5/commit/c0d3a8572974a20ea6cee42da11c614a54f100e8", "ref_desc": "[BREAKING] Security: Disable JavaScript execution in Less.js \u00b7 SAP/less-openui5@c0d3a85 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://lesscss.org/usage/#less-options-enable-inline-javascript-deprecated-", "ref_desc": "Using Less.js | Less.jsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
