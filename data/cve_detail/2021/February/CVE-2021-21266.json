{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21266", "Description": "openHAB is a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home. In openHAB before versions 2.5.12 and 3.0.1 the XML external entity (XXE) attack allows attackers in the same network as the openHAB instance to retrieve internal information like the content of files from the file system. Responses to SSDP requests can be especially malicious. All add-ons that use SAX or JAXB parsing of externally received XML are potentially subject to this kind of attack. In openHAB, the following add-ons are potentially impacted: AvmFritz, BoseSoundtouch, DenonMarantz, DLinkSmarthome, Enigma2, FmiWeather, FSInternetRadio, Gce, Homematic, HPPrinter, IHC, Insteon, Onkyo, Roku, SamsungTV, Sonos, Roku, Tellstick, TR064, UPnPControl, Vitotronic, Wemo, YamahaReceiver and XPath Tranformation. The vulnerabilities have been fixed in versions 2.5.12 and 3.0.1 by a more strict configuration of the used XML parser.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21266", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nOpenhab\u00bbOpenhabVersions  before (<) 2.5.12cpe:2.3:a:openhab:openhab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenhab\u00bbOpenhab\u00bbVersion:3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:openhab:openhab:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://dev.to/brianverm/configure-your-java-xml-parsers-to-prevent-xxe-213c", "ref_desc": "Configure your Java XML-parsers to prevent XXE - DEV CommunityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/xml-xxe-pitfalls-with-jaxb", "ref_desc": "XML External Entity (XXE) Pitfalls With JAXBTechnical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/commit/81935b0ab126e6d9aebd2f6c3fc67d82bb7e8b86", "ref_desc": "Fix XXE vulnerabilities in multiple add-ons \u00b7 openhab/openhab-addons@81935b0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/security/advisories/GHSA-r2hc-pmr7-4c9r", "ref_desc": "XXE vulnerabilities in multiple add-ons \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openhab/openhab-addons \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
