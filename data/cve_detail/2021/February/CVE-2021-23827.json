It fails to effectively clear cached pictures, even after deletion via normal methodology within the client, or by utilizing the \"Explode message/Explode now\" functionality. Local filesystem access is needed by the attacker.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23827", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKeybase\u00bbKeybaseVersions  before (<) 5.6.0cpe:2.3:a:keybase:keybase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nKeybase\u00bbKeybaseVersions  before (<) 5.6.1cpe:2.3:o:keybase:keybase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Redhat\u00bbLinux\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2021-23827/", "ref_desc": "John J HackingExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1074930", "ref_desc": "HackerOneExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/keybase/client/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 keybase/client \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
