{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25630", "Description": "\"loolforkit\" is a privileged program that is supposed to be run by a special, non-privileged \"lool\" user. Before doing anything else \"loolforkit\" checks, if it was invoked by the \"lool\" user, and refuses to run with privileges, if it's not the case. In the vulnerable version of \"loolforkit\" this check was wrong, so a normal user could start \"loolforkit\" and eventually get local root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25630", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCollaboraoffice\u00bbOnlineVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.0andbefore (<) 6.4.3cpe:2.3:a:collaboraoffice:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCollaboraoffice\u00bbOnlineVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andbefore (<) 4.2.13cpe:2.3:a:collaboraoffice:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/security/advisories/GHSA-49w3-gr3w-m68v", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-25630: \"loolforkit\" privileged program local root exploit \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CollaboraOnline/online \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/18/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - libreoffice-online \"loolforkit\" privileged program local root exploitMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
