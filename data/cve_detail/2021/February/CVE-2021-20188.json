{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20188", "Description": "A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20188", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container Platform\u00bbVersion:3.11cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPodman Project\u00bbPodmanVersions  before (<) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:podman_project:podman:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915734", "ref_desc": "1915734 \u2013 (CVE-2021-20188) CVE-2021-20188 podman: container users permissions are not respected in privileged containersIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
