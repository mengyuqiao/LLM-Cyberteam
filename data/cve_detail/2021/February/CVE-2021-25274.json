{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25274", "Description": "The Collector Service in SolarWinds Orion Platform before 2020.2.4 uses MSMQ (Microsoft Message Queue) and doesn't set permissions on its private queues. As a result, remote unauthenticated clients can send messages to TCP port 1801 that the Collector Service will process. Additionally, upon processing of such messages, the service deserializes them in insecure manner, allowing remote arbitrary code execution as LocalSystem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25274", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolarwinds\u00bbOrion PlatformVersions  before (<) 2020.2.4cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:orion_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "6.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.74%  6.20%  +2.46 \n 2  2024-11-23  5.29%  3.74%  -1.54 \n 3  2024-10-21  5.48%  5.29%  -0.20 \n 4  2024-06-08  5.16%  5.48%  +0.32 \n 5  2024-01-10  4.90%  5.16%  +0.26 \n 6  2023-10-20  4.60%  4.90%  +0.30 \n 7  2023-09-10  3.46%  4.60%  +1.14 \n 8  2023-07-19  3.35%  3.46%  +0.12 \n 9  2023-07-15  2.79%  3.35%  +0.55 \n 10  2023-04-28  4.92%  2.79%  -2.13 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.16%  4.92%  +3.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/full-system-control-with-new-solarwinds-orion-based-and-serv-u-ftp-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "Full System Control with New SolarWinds Orion-based and Serv-U FTP Vulnerabilities | TrustwaveExploit;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CvpKxQngAP6ssZJr_sNIuJjso4A.html"}]}
