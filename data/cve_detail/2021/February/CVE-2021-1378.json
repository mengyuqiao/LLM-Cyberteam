{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1378", "Description": "A vulnerability in the SSH service of the Cisco StarOS operating system could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1378", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbStarosVersions  from including (>=) 21.9.0andup to, including, (<=) 21.19.10cpe:2.3:o:cisco:staros:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-03  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-09-24  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-StarOS-DoS-RLLvGFJj", "ref_desc": "Cisco StarOS Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
