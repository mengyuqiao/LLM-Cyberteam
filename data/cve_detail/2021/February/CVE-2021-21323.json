{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21323", "Description": "Brave is an open source web browser with a focus on privacy and security. In Brave versions 1.17.73-1.20.103, the CNAME adblocking feature added in Brave 1.17.73 accidentally initiated DNS requests that bypassed the Brave Tor proxy. Users with adblocking enabled would leak DNS requests from Tor windows to their DNS provider. (DNS requests that were not initiated by CNAME adblocking would go through Tor as expected.) This is fixed in Brave version 1.20.108", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21323", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nBrave\u00bbBraveVersions  from including (>=) 1.17.73andup to, including, (<=) 1.20.103cpe:2.3:a:brave:brave:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-12-13  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-09  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-01  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-04  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/security/advisories/GHSA-mqjf-9x5g-2rv6", "ref_desc": "Regression in DNS leakage from Tor windows \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 brave/brave-browser \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1077022", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gsmkOZ3B5--qW4tjbY59leWT81M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/13527", "ref_desc": "[hackerone] Tor DNS issue \u00b7 Issue #13527 \u00b7 brave/brave-browser \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/brave/brave-core/commit/12fe321eaad8acc1cbd1d70b4128f687777bcf15", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #7769 from brave/tor-dns-leak \u00b7 brave/brave-core@12fe321 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/7769", "ref_desc": "Fix Tor dns leak by darkdh \u00b7 Pull Request #7769 \u00b7 brave/brave-core \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
