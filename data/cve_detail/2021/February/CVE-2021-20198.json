{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20198", "Description": "A flaw was found in the OpenShift Installer before version v0.9.0-master.0.20210125200451-95101da940b0. During installation of OpenShift Container Platform 4 clusters, bootstrap nodes are provisioned with anonymous authentication enabled on kubelet port 10250. A remote attacker able to reach this port during installation can make unauthenticated `/exec` requests to execute arbitrary commands within running containers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20198", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift InstallerVersions  before (<) 0.9.0-master.0.20210125200451-95101da940b0cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_installer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-09  0.14%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-01  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 4  2023-07-12  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-05-18  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1920764", "ref_desc": "1920764 \u2013 (CVE-2021-20198) CVE-2021-20198 openshift/installer: Bootstrap nodes allow anonymous authentication on kubelet port 10250Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
