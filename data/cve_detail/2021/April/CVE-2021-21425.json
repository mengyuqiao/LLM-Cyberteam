{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21425", "Description": "Grav Admin Plugin is an HTML user interface that provides a way to configure Grav and create and modify pages. In versions 1.10.7 and earlier, an unauthenticated user can execute some methods of administrator controller without needing any credentials. Particular method execution will result in arbitrary YAML file creation or content change of existing YAML files on the system. Successfully exploitation of that vulnerability results in configuration changes, such as general site information change, custom scheduler job definition, etc. Due to the nature of the vulnerability, an adversary can change some part of the webpage, or hijack an administrator account, or execute operating system command under the context of the web-server user. This vulnerability is fixed in version 1.10.8. Blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources can be applied as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21425", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGetgrav\u00bbGrav-plugin-adminVersions  before (<) 1.10.8cpe:2.3:a:getgrav:grav-plugin-admin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "91.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  87.45%  91.04%  +3.60 \n 2  2024-12-05  84.26%  87.45%  +3.19 \n 3  2024-11-02  84.95%  84.26%  -0.70 \n 4  2024-09-10  82.40%  84.95%  +2.55 \n 5  2024-08-25  81.16%  82.40%  +1.25 \n 6  2024-07-24  78.81%  81.16%  +2.35 \n 7  2024-07-09  74.43%  78.81%  +4.38 \n 8  2024-06-24  75.63%  74.43%  -1.20 \n 9  2024-04-24  80.72%  75.63%  -5.09 \n 10  2024-03-26  80.23%  80.72%  +0.49 \n 11  2024-03-13  75.72%  80.23%  +4.51 \n 12  2024-02-28  71.50%  75.72%  +4.22 \n 13  2024-02-01  65.82%  71.50%  +5.68 \n 14  2023-12-22  58.10%  65.82%  +7.73 \n 15  2023-12-09  53.42%  58.10%  +4.67 \n 16  2023-11-26  55.11%  53.42%  -1.68 \n 17  2023-11-12  51.05%  55.11%  +4.06 \n 18  2023-10-17  50.19%  51.05%  +0.85 \n 19  2023-10-04  52.98%  50.19%  -2.78 \n 20  2023-09-20  63.27%  52.98%  -10.29 \n 21  2023-09-07  64.51%  63.27%  -1.25 \n 22  2023-08-09  68.97%  64.51%  -4.45 \n 23  2023-07-12  72.15%  68.97%  -3.19 \n 24  2023-06-30  73.30%  72.15%  -1.15 \n 25  2023-06-15  65.99%  73.30%  +7.31 \n 26  2023-06-01  66.41%  65.99%  -0.42 \n 27  2023-05-04  59.57%  66.41%  +6.83 \n 28  2023-04-21  32.67%  59.57%  +26.90 \n 29  2023-04-04  31.64%  32.67%  +1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pentest.blog/unexpected-journey-7-gravcms-unauthenticated-arbitrary-yaml-write-update-leads-to-code-execution/", "ref_desc": "Unexpected Journey #7 \u2013 GravCMS Unauthenticated Arbitrary YAML Write/Update leads to Code Execution \u2013 Pentest BlogExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin/security/advisories/GHSA-6f53-6qgv-39pj", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated Arbitrary YAML Write/Update leads to Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getgrav/grav-plugin-admin \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162457/GravCMS-1.10.7-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "GravCMS 1.10.7 Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162283/GravCMS-1.10.7-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "GravCMS 1.10.7 Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
