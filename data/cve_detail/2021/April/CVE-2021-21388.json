A command injection vulnerability has been discovered in versions of systeminformation prior to 5.6.4. The issue has been fixed with a parameter check on user input. Please upgrade to version >= 5.6.4. If you cannot upgrade, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() and other commands. Only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21388", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSysteminformation\u00bbSysteminformation\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.6.4cpe:2.3:a:systeminformation:systeminformation:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.82%  1.12%  +0.30 \n 2  2024-05-02  0.58%  0.82%  +0.24 \n 3  2024-03-21  0.41%  0.58%  +0.17 \n 4  2024-01-13  0.42%  0.41%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-12-04  0.41%  0.42%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-08  0.39%  0.41%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-26  0.28%  0.39%  +0.12 \n 8  2023-03-16  0.28%  0.28%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  2.36%  0.28%  -2.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/commit/7922366d707de7f20995fc8e30ac3153636bf35f", "ref_desc": "sanitizeShellString() and other security improvements \u00b7 sebhildebrandt/systeminformation@7922366 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/commit/01ef56cd5824ed6da1c11b37013a027fdef67524", "ref_desc": "sanitizeShellString() and other security improvements \u00b7 sebhildebrandt/systeminformation@01ef56c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/commit/0be6fcd575c05687d1076d5cd6d75af2ebae5a46", "ref_desc": "sanitizeShellString() and other security improvements \u00b7 sebhildebrandt/systeminformation@0be6fcd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/security/advisories/GHSA-jff2-qjw8-5476", "ref_desc": "Command Injection Vulnerability in systeminformation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sebhildebrandt/systeminformation \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/systeminformation", "ref_desc": "systeminformation - npmProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xFIf8gjCkTspu8UZmM9qj_LqyXE.html"}]}
