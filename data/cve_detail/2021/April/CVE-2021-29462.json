{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29462", "Description": "The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices is an SDK for development of UPnP device and control point applications. The server part of pupnp (libupnp) appears to be vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks because it does not check the value of the `Host` header. This can be mitigated by using DNS revolvers which block DNS-rebinding attacks. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.14.6 and later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29462", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nPupnp Project\u00bbPupnpVersions  before (<) 1.14.6cpe:2.3:a:pupnp_project:pupnp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-07  0.19%  0.27%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-01-04  0.18%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/20/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - DNS rebinding vulnerability in pupnpMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pupnp/pupnp/security/advisories/GHSA-6hqq-w3jq-9fhg", "ref_desc": "DNS rebinding in pupnp \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pupnp/pupnp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
