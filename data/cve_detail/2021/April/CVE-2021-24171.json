{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24171", "Description": "The WooCommerce Upload Files WordPress plugin before 59.4 ran a single sanitization pass to remove blocked extensions such as .php. It was possible to bypass this and upload a file with a PHP extension by embedding a \"blocked\" extension within another \"blocked\" extension in the \"wcuf_file_name\" parameter. It was also possible to perform a double extension attack and upload files to a different location via path traversal using the \"wcuf_current_upload_session_id\" parameter.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24171", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nVanquish\u00bbWoocommerce Upload Files\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 59.4cpe:2.3:a:vanquish:woocommerce_upload_files:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-20  0.21%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/ed4288a1-f7e4-455f-b765-5ac343f87194", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/03/critical-vulnerability-patched-in-woocommerce-upload-files/", "ref_desc": "Critical Vulnerability Patched in WooCommerce Upload FilesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
