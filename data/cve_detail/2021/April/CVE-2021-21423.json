{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21423", "Description": "`projen` is a project generation tool that synthesizes project configuration files such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, `eslint`, `jest`, and more, from a well-typed definition written in JavaScript. Users of projen's `NodeProject` project type (including any project type derived from it) include a `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` workflow that may allow any GitHub user to trigger execution of un-trusted code in the context of the \"main\" repository (as opposed to that of a fork). In some situations, such untrusted code may potentially be able to commit to the \"main\" repository. The rebuild-bot workflow is triggered by comments including `@projen rebuild` on pull-request to trigger a re-build of the projen project, and updating the pull request with the updated files. This workflow is triggered by an `issue_comment` event, and thus always executes with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository into which the pull-request is made (this is in contrast with workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, which always execute with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository from which the pull-request is made). Repositories that do not have branch protection configured on their default branch (typically `main` or `master`) could possibly allow an untrusted user to gain access to secrets configured on the repository (such as NPM tokens, etc). Branch protection prohibits this escalation, as the managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not be able to modify the contents of a protected branch and affected workflows must be defined on the default branch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21423", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nProjen Project\u00bbProjen\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 0.6.0andbefore (<) 0.16.41cpe:2.3:a:projen_project:projen:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.28%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.25%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-08-09  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-03  0.24%  0.24%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.24%  -1.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-527 Exposure of Version-Control Repository to an Unauthorized Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/527/Exposure-of-Version-Control-Repository-to-an-Unauthorized-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/projen/projen/security/advisories/GHSA-gg2g-m5wc-vccq", "ref_desc": "Rebuild-bot workflow may allow unauthorised repository modifications \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 projen/projen \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/projen/projen/commit/36030c6a4b1acd0054673322612e7c70e9446643", "ref_desc": "fix(node): security vulnerability in rebuild-bot (#602) \u00b7 projen/projen@36030c6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/projen", "ref_desc": "projen - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
