{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29453", "Description": "matrix-media-repo is an open-source multi-domain media repository for Matrix. Versions 1.2.6 and earlier of matrix-media-repo do not properly handle malicious images which are crafted to be small in file size, but large in complexity. A malicious user could upload a relatively small image in terms of file size, using particular image formats, which expands to have extremely large dimensions during the process of thumbnailing. The server can be exhausted of memory in the process of trying to load the whole image into memory for thumbnailing, leading to denial of service. Version 1.2.7 has a fix for the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29453", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix-media-repo Project\u00bbMatrix-media-repoVersions  before (<) 1.2.7cpe:2.3:a:matrix-media-repo_project:matrix-media-repo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hub.docker.com/r/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated", "ref_desc": "turt2live/matrix-media-repo TagsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/security/advisories/GHSA-j889-h476-hh9h", "ref_desc": "Denial of service through memory exhaustion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 turt2live/matrix-media-repo \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.2.7", "ref_desc": "Release v1.2.7 \u00b7 turt2live/matrix-media-repo \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
