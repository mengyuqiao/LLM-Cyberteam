{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24208", "Description": "The editor of the WP Page Builder WordPress plugin before 1.2.4 allows lower-privileged users to insert unfiltered HTML, including JavaScript, into pages via the \u201cRaw HTML\u201d widget and the \u201cCustom HTML\u201d widgets (though the custom HTML widget requires sending a crafted request - it appears that this widget uses some form of client side validation but not server side validation), all of which are added via the \u201cpage_builder_data\u201d parameter when performing the \u201cwppb_page_save\u201d AJAX action. It is also possible to insert malicious JavaScript via the \u201cwppb_page_css\u201d parameter (this can be done by closing out the style tag and opening a script tag) when performing the \u201cwppb_page_save\u201d AJAX action.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24208", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nThemeum\u00bbWp Page Builder\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 1.2.4cpe:2.3:a:themeum:wp_page_builder:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.themeum.com/wp-page-builder-updated-v1-2-4/", "ref_desc": "WP Page Builder Updated: Security Issues Fixed (Thanks to Wordfence) - ThemeumPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6zDfmSIFTaRcY2GuQJXpuPV0H50.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/c20e243d-b0de-4ae5-9a0d-b9d02c9b8141", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
