{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29430", "Description": "Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29430", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSydentVersions  before (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:sydent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.47%  0.37%  -0.10 \n 2  2023-12-30  0.41%  0.47%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-11-20  0.40%  0.41%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-25  0.28%  0.40%  +0.12 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.28%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/commit/0523511d2fb40f2738f8a8549868f44b96e5dab7", "ref_desc": "Limit the size of .well-known lookups. \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent@0523511 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/commit/89071a1a754c69a50deac89e6bb74002d4cda19d", "ref_desc": "Limit maximum request size. \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent@89071a1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/matrix-sydent/", "ref_desc": "matrix-sydent \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mI_E45BtgWItHm0ZiFYTtMbIaWE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/commit/f56eee315b6c44fdd9f6aa785cc2ec744a594428", "ref_desc": "Add max size for other HTTP calls. \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent@f56eee3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release Sydent 2.3.0 (2021-04-15) \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rMhH2zc5q-ne1tq5Lp1-SVBbm3s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/security/advisories/GHSA-wmg4-8cp2-hpg9", "ref_desc": "Denial of service attack via disk space or memory exhaustion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
