{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20235", "Description": "There's a flaw in the zeromq server in versions before 4.3.3 in src/decoder_allocators.hpp. The decoder static allocator could have its sized changed, but the buffer would remain the same as it is a static buffer. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who sends a crafted request to the zeromq server could trigger a buffer overflow WRITE of arbitrary data if CURVE/ZAP authentication is not enabled. The greatest impact of this flaw is to application availability, data integrity, and confidentiality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20235", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nZeromq\u00bbLibzmqVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andbefore (<) 4.3.3cpe:2.3:a:zeromq:libzmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.41%  0.66%  +0.25 \n 2  2024-11-29  0.35%  0.41%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-03-20  0.27%  0.35%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-12-16  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.24%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6", "ref_desc": "Heap overflow when receiving malformed ZMTP v1 packets (CURVE disabled) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zeromq/libzmq \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921983", "ref_desc": "1921983 \u2013 (CVE-2021-20235) CVE-2021-20235 zeromq: Heap overflow when receiving malformed ZMTP v1 packetsIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
