{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-30245", "Description": "The project received a report that all versions of Apache OpenOffice through 4.1.8 can open non-http(s) hyperlinks. The problem has existed since about 2006 and the issue is also in 4.1.9. If the link is specifically crafted this could lead to untrusted code execution. It is always best practice to be careful opening documents from unknown and unverified sources. The mitigation in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.10 (unreleased) assures that a security warning is displayed giving the user the option of continuing to open the hyperlink.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30245", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbOpenofficeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.1.8cpe:2.3:a:apache:openoffice:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.14%  1.47%  +0.33 \n 2  2023-12-30  1.00%  1.14%  +0.14 \n 3  2023-11-20  0.97%  1.00%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.58%  0.97%  +0.40 \n 5  2023-03-15  0.58%  0.58%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.76%  0.58%  -2.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r87ff11512e4883052991e6b725e20294224034ea8453b811fb3ee735@%3Cdev.openoffice.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Pony Mail!Mailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra2cabdc083d5160a84de9a6436296ee5030fb3a16dc490dee4f983d5@%3Cdev.openoffice.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Re: CVE-2021-30245: Code execution in Apache OpenOffice via non-http(s) schemes in Hyperlinks - Pony MailMailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r87ff11512e4883052991e6b725e20294224034ea8453b811fb3ee735@%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-30245: Code execution in Apache OpenOffice via non-http(s) schemes in Hyperlinks - Pony MailMailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r87ff11512e4883052991e6b725e20294224034ea8453b811fb3ee735%40%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-30245: Code execution in Apache OpenOffice via non-http(s) schemes in Hyperlinks - Pony MailMailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r7c01173f763b0c4212ada0e6ab283984d6e058d72258efce85c006ab@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-30245: Code execution in Apache OpenOffice via non-http(s) schemes in Hyperlinks - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra2cabdc083d5160a84de9a6436296ee5030fb3a16dc490dee4f983d5@%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Re: CVE-2021-30245: Code execution in Apache OpenOffice via non-http(s) schemes in Hyperlinks - Pony MailMailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
