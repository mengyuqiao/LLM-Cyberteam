{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29434", "Description": "Wagtail is a Django content management system. In affected versions of Wagtail, when saving the contents of a rich text field in the admin interface, Wagtail does not apply server-side checks to ensure that link URLs use a valid protocol. A malicious user with access to the admin interface could thus craft a POST request to publish content with `javascript:` URLs containing arbitrary code. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. See referenced GitHub advisory for additional details, including a workaround. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.11.7 (for the LTS 2.11 branch) and Wagtail 2.12.4 (for the current 2.12 branch).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29434", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtail\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.11.0andbefore (<) 2.11.7cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 2.12.0andbefore (<) 2.12.4cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtail\u00bbVersions  before (<) 2.11.6cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-wq5h-f9p5-q7fx", "ref_desc": "Improper validation of URLs ('Cross-site Scripting') in Wagtail rich text fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/wagtail/", "ref_desc": "wagtail \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
