{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29435", "Description": "trestle-auth is an authentication plugin for the Trestle admin framework. A vulnerability in trestle-auth versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 allows an attacker to create a form that will bypass Rails' built-in CSRF protection when submitted by a victim with a trestle-auth admin session. This potentially allows an attacker to alter protected data, including admin account credentials. The vulnerability has been fixed in trestle-auth 0.4.2 released to RubyGems.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29435", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nTrestle-auth Project\u00bbTrestle-auth\u00bbVersion:0.4.0ForRubycpe:2.3:a:trestle-auth_project:trestle-auth:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nTrestle-auth Project\u00bbTrestle-auth\u00bbVersion:0.4.1ForRubycpe:2.3:a:trestle-auth_project:trestle-auth:0.4.1:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  0.00 \n 2  2023-10-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TrestleAdmin/trestle-auth/commit/cb95b05cdb2609052207af07b4b8dfe3a23c11dc", "ref_desc": "Ensure CSRF protection is prepended before authentication before_actions \u00b7 TrestleAdmin/trestle-auth@cb95b05 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rubygems.org/gems/trestle-auth", "ref_desc": "trestle-auth | RubyGems.org | your community gem hostProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TrestleAdmin/trestle-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-h8hx-2c5r-32cf", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in trestle-auth \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TrestleAdmin/trestle-auth \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
