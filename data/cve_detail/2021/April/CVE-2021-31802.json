{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-31802", "Description": "NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\n before the Content-Length header.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31802", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNetgear\u00bbR7000 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.11.116cpe:2.3:o:netgear:r7000_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Netgear\u00bbR7000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "4.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.69%  4.25%  +2.56 \n 2  2024-08-29  1.58%  1.69%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-08-12  1.70%  1.58%  -0.12 \n 4  2024-04-29  1.21%  1.70%  +0.50 \n 5  2024-04-01  1.35%  1.21%  -0.15 \n 6  2024-01-10  1.24%  1.35%  +0.11 \n 7  2023-12-01  0.89%  1.24%  +0.35 \n 8  2023-10-23  0.50%  0.89%  +0.38 \n 9  2023-05-10  0.71%  0.50%  -0.20 \n 10  2023-03-07  22.08%  0.71%  -21.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-netgear-nighthawk-r7000-httpd-preauth-rce/", "ref_desc": "SSD Advisory \u2013 NETGEAR Nighthawk R7000 httpd PreAuth RCE - SSD Secure DisclosureExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.netgear.com/about/security/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory | About Us | NETGEARVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TY3UWfiJsf0KrJJzkeXHxBJ0hWM.html"}]}
