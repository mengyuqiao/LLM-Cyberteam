{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29465", "Description": "Discord-Recon is a bot for the Discord chat service. Versions of Discord-Recon 0.0.3 and prior contain a vulnerability in which a remote attacker is able to overwrite any file on the system with the command results. This can result in remote code execution when the user overwrite important files on the system. As a workaround, bot maintainers can edit their `setting.py` file then add `<` and `>` into the `RCE` variable inside of it to fix the issue without an update. The vulnerability is patched in version 0.0.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29465", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDiscord\u00bbDiscord-reconVersions  before (<) 0.0.4cpe:2.3:a:discord:discord-recon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.44% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.48%  0.44%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.42%  0.48%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-01-05  0.35%  0.42%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-11-26  0.32%  0.35%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-10-31  0.33%  0.32%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-10-04  0.32%  0.33%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-07-14  0.29%  0.32%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-04-06  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.28%  -0.88 \n 10  2023-02-22  15.36%  1.16%  -14.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DEMON1A/Discord-Recon/security/advisories/GHSA-6pp2-rpj3-jcjx", "ref_desc": "Remote file overwrite on discord-recon can result in DoS and Remote Code Execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DEMON1A/Discord-Recon \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
