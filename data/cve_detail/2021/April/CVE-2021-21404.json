{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21404", "Description": "Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21404", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSyncthing\u00bbSyncthingVersions  before (<) 1.15.0cpe:2.3:a:syncthing:syncthing:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-12-21  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-11-11  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-10-16  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.14%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/syncthing/syncthing", "ref_desc": "syncthing \u00b7 pkg.go.devProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/commit/fb4fdaf4c0a79c22cad000c42ac1394e3ccb6a97", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-x462-89pf-6r5h \u00b7 syncthing/syncthing@fb4fdaf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/security/advisories/GHSA-x462-89pf-6r5h", "ref_desc": "Crash due to malformed relay protocol message \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 syncthing/syncthing \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases/tag/v1.15.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.15.0 \u00b7 syncthing/syncthing \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
