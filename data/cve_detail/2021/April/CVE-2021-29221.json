{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29221", "Description": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in Erlang/OTP prior to version 23.2.3. By adding files to an existing installation's directory, a local attacker could hijack accounts of other users running Erlang programs or possibly coerce a service running with \"erlsrv.exe\" to execute arbitrary code as Local System. This can occur only under specific conditions on Windows with unsafe filesystem permissions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29221", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nErlang\u00bbErlang/otpVersions  before (<) 23.2.3cpe:2.3:a:erlang:erlang\\/otp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-15  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-24  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.07%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-23.2.3", "ref_desc": "Release OTP 23.2.3 \u00b7 erlang/otp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://deepsurface.com/deepsurface-security-advisory-local-privilege-escalation-in-erlang-on-windows-cve-2021-29221/", "ref_desc": "DeepSurface Security Advisory: Local Privilege Escalation in Erlang on Windows (CVE-2021-29221)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
