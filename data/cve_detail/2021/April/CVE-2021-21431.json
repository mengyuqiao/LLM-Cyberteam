{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21431", "Description": "sopel-channelmgnt is a channelmgnt plugin for sopel. In versions prior to 2.0.1, on some IRC servers, restrictions around the removal of the bot using the kick/kickban command could be bypassed when kicking multiple users at once. We also believe it may have been possible to remove users from other channels but due to the wonder that is IRC and following RfCs, We have no POC for that. Freenode is not affected. This is fixed in version 2.0.1. As a workaround, do not use this plugin on networks where TARGMAX > 1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21431", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMirahezebots\u00bbChannelmgnt\u00bbForSopelVersions  before (<) 2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:mirahezebots:channelmgnt:*:*:*:*:*:sopel:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-08-27  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/MirahezeBots/sopel-channelmgnt/security/advisories/GHSA-23c7-6444-399m", "ref_desc": "Improper Input Validation in sopel-plugins.channelmgnt kick/ban logic \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 MirahezeBots/sopel-channelmgnt \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/sopel-plugins.channelmgnt/", "ref_desc": "sopel-plugins.channelmgnt \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oA5fmsvCmPF3D-5yNNFLzyE2qbE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MirahezeBots/sopel-channelmgnt/commit/7c96d400358221e59135f0a0be0744f3fad73856", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Release 2.0.1 (#65) \u00b7 MirahezeBots/sopel-channelmgnt@7c96d40 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
