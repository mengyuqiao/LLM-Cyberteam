{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-31552", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31552", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMediawiki\u00bbMediawikiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.35.2cpe:2.3:a:mediawiki:mediawiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T152394", "ref_desc": "\u2693 T152394 AbuseFilter privacy concerns on action == 'createaccount' and 'accountname'Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/q/I8bae477ad7e4d0190335363ac2decf28e4313da1", "ref_desc": "I8bae477ad7e4d0190335363ac2decf28e4313da1 \u00b7 Gerrit Code ReviewIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
