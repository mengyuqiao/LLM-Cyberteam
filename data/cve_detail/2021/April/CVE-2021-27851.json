{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-27851", "Description": "A security vulnerability that can lead to local privilege escalation has been found in \u2019guix-daemon\u2019. It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27851", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbGuixVersions  from including (>=) 0.11.0andbefore (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:gnu:guix:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2021/risk-of-local-privilege-escalation-via-guix-daemon/", "ref_desc": "Risk of local privilege escalation via guix-daemon \u2014 2021 \u2014 Blog \u2014 GNU\u00a0GuixPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.gnu.org/47229", "ref_desc": "#47229 - Local privilege escalation via guix-daemon and \u2018--keep-failed\u2019 - GNU bug report logsIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
