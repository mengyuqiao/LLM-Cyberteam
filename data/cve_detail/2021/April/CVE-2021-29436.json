{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29436", "Description": "Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. In Time Tracker before version 1.19.27.5431 a Cross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability existed. The nature of CSRF is that a logged on user may be tricked by social engineering to click on an attacker-provided form that executes an unintended action such as changing user password. The vulnerability is fixed in Time Tracker version 1.19.27.5431. Upgrade is recommended. If upgrade is not practical, introduce ttMitigateCSRF() function in /WEB-INF/lib/common.php.lib using the latest available code and call it from ttAccessAllowed().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29436", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nAnuko\u00bbTime TrackerVersions  before (<) 1.19.27.5431cpe:2.3:a:anuko:time_tracker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-12-28  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2023-11-18  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-23  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/e3f8222ee308322942bcebcd86b78ecf19382563", "ref_desc": "Tested CSRF fix for custom ports - it's working, also removed unneces\u2026 \u00b7 anuko/timetracker@e3f8222 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-pgpx-rfvj-9g4f", "ref_desc": "Cross site request forgery vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anuko/timetracker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/e77be7eea69df5d52e19f9f25b5b89a0e66a5b8e", "ref_desc": "An attempt to mitigate cross site request forgery vulnerability. \u00b7 anuko/timetracker@e77be7e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
