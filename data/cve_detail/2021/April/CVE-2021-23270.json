This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23270", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGargoyle-router\u00bbGargoyle\u00bbVersion:1.12.0cpe:2.3:a:gargoyle-router:gargoyle:1.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-27  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-834 Excessive Iteration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/834/Excessive-Iteration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ericpaulbishop/gargoyle/commit/24afe944a6ffff53d84a748384e276a4e95912ec", "ref_desc": "Fix IPv6 routing loops \u00b7 ericpaulbishop/gargoyle@24afe94 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
