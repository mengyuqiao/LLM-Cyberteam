{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29455", "Description": "Grassroot Platform is an application to make it faster, cheaper and easier to persistently organize and mobilize people in low-income communities. Grassroot Platform before master deployment as of 2021-04-16 did not properly verify the signature of JSON Web Tokens when refreshing an existing JWT. This allows to forge a valid JWT. The problem has been patched in version 1.3.1 by deprecating the JWT refresh function, which was an overdue deprecation regardless (the \"refresh\" flow is no longer used).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29455", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGrassroot\u00bbGrassroot PlatformVersions  before (<) 1.3.1cpe:2.3:a:grassroot:grassroot_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-01-03  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-24  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/commit/a2e6e885f8183a066d938cf909fd813a7af7d67f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #412 from grassrootza/fix/refresh \u00b7 grassrootza/grassroot-platform@a2e6e88 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/", "ref_desc": "GitHub - grassrootza/grassroot-platform: Modular application to make it easier and faster to organize and mobilize people, through a meeting organizer, vote taker, action logger and group manager.Product;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-f65w-6xw8-6734", "ref_desc": "Missing validation of JWT signature in `grassrootza/grassroot-platform` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grassrootza/grassroot-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
