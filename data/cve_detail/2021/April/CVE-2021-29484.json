{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29484", "Description": "Ghost is a Node.js CMS. An unused endpoint added during the development of 4.0.0 has left sites vulnerable to untrusted users gaining access to Ghost Admin. Attackers can gain access by getting logged in users to click a link containing malicious code. Users do not need to enter credentials and may not know they've visited a malicious site. Ghost(Pro) has already been patched. We can find no evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch being added. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version between 4.0.0 and 4.3.2. Immediate action should be taken to secure your site. The issue has been fixed in 4.3.3, all 4.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible. As the endpoint is unused, the patch simply removes it. As a workaround blocking access to /ghost/preview can also mitigate the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29484", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGhost\u00bbGhost\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.3.3cpe:2.3:a:ghost:ghost:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.39%  0.27%  -2.12 \n 2  2024-10-02  2.51%  2.39%  -0.12 \n 3  2024-09-01  2.09%  2.51%  +0.42 \n 4  2024-07-31  1.48%  2.09%  +0.61 \n 5  2024-04-17  1.42%  1.48%  +0.06 \n 6  2024-02-08  1.01%  1.42%  +0.42 \n 7  2024-01-13  1.11%  1.01%  -0.10 \n 8  2023-12-04  1.08%  1.11%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-05-26  1.18%  1.08%  -0.10 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  1.18%  +0.17 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghost", "ref_desc": "ghost - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/security/advisories/GHSA-9fgx-q25h-jxrg", "ref_desc": "DOM XSS in Theme Preview \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TryGhost/Ghost \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://forum.ghost.org/t/critical-security-update-available-for-ghost-4-x/22290", "ref_desc": "Critical security update available for Ghost 4.x - News - Ghost ForumVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/ghost-admin-takeover", "ref_desc": "Ghost CMS 4.3.2 - Cross-Origin Admin TakeoverExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
