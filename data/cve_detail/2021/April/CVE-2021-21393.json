{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21393", "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.28.0 Synapse is missing input validation of some parameters on the endpoints used to confirm third-party identifiers could cause excessive use of disk space and memory leading to resource exhaustion. Note that the groups feature is not part of the Matrix specification and the chosen maximum lengths are arbitrary. Not all clients might abide by them. Refer to referenced GitHub security advisory for additional details including workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21393", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  after (>) 0.24.0andbefore (<) 1.28.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.14%  -0.14 \n 2  2024-09-15  0.20%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-12-14  0.14%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jrh7-mhhx-6h88", "ref_desc": "Denial of service (via resource exhaustion) due to improper input validation on groups/communities endpoints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9321", "ref_desc": "Type hints and validation improvements by clokep \u00b7 Pull Request #9321 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/d3tTYsEEO5I47So-vGh3jgtcZ-g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse/", "ref_desc": "matrix-synapse \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DleoNHEqDCjQk1CEgsWslPoX3ok.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TNNAJOZNMVMXM6AS7RFFKB4QLUJ4IFEY/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: matrix-synapse-1.38.1-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oPIMUqas_a3SnUkiCoZn8rZNRew.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9393", "ref_desc": "Add type hints to groups code by clokep \u00b7 Pull Request #9393 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qQdsXgf7OGB7OTa4le4di-dlaws.html"}]}
