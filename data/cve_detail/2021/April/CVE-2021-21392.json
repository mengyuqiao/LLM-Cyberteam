{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21392", "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.28.0 requests to user provided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses when transitional IPv6 addresses were used. Outbound requests to federation, identity servers, when calculating the key validity for third-party invite events, sending push notifications, and generating URL previews are affected. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure on dual-stack networks. See referenced GitHub security advisory for details and workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21392", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.28.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-5wrh-4jwv-5w78", "ref_desc": "Open redirect via transitional IPv6 addresses on dual-stack networks \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse/", "ref_desc": "matrix-synapse \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DleoNHEqDCjQk1CEgsWslPoX3ok.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TNNAJOZNMVMXM6AS7RFFKB4QLUJ4IFEY/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: matrix-synapse-1.38.1-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oPIMUqas_a3SnUkiCoZn8rZNRew.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9240", "ref_desc": "Convert blacklisted IPv4 addresses to compatible IPv6 addresses. by clokep \u00b7 Pull Request #9240 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
