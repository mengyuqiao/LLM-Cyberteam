{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28098", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Forescout CounterACT before 8.1.4. A local privilege escalation vulnerability is present in the logging function. SecureConnector runs with administrative privileges and writes logs entries to a file in %PROGRAMDATA%\\ForeScout SecureConnector\\ that has full permissions for the Everyone group. Using a symbolic link allows an attacker to point the log file to a privileged location such as %WINDIR%\\System32. The resulting log file adopts the file permissions of the source of the symbolic link (in this case, the Everyone group). The log file in System32 can be replaced and renamed with a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28098", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nForescout\u00bbCounteractVersions  before (<) 8.1.4cpe:2.3:a:forescout:counteract:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-29  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-19  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jordanpotti.com/2021/03/30/forescout-priv-esc-folder-permissions/", "ref_desc": "ForeScout Secure Connector Local Privilege Escalation \u2013 Jordan Potti \u2013 Security ThingsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.adversis.io/research/2021/3/30/forescout-secure-connector-local-privilege-escalation", "ref_desc": "ForeScout Secure Connector Local Privilege Escalation \u2014 AdversisExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.forescout.com", "ref_desc": "Forescout Documentation PortalVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
