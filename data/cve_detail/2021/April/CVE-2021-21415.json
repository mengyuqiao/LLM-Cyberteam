{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21415", "Description": "Prisma VS Code a VSCode extension for Prisma schema files. This is a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability that affects all versions of the Prisma VS Code extension older than 2.20.0. If a custom binary path for the Prisma format binary is set in VS Code Settings, for example by downloading a project that has a .vscode/settings.json file that sets a value for \"prismaFmtBinPath\". That custom binary is executed when auto-formatting is triggered by VS Code or when validation checks are triggered after each keypress on a *.prisma file. Fixed in versions 2.20.0 and 20.0.27. As a workaround users can either edit or delete the `.vscode/settings.json` file or check if the binary is malicious and delete it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21415", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nPrisma\u00bbLanguage-tools\u00bbForVisual Studio CodeVersions  before (<) 2.20.0cpe:2.3:a:prisma:language-tools:*:*:*:*:*:visual_studio_code:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.76% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-04  0.72%  0.76%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-01-13  0.63%  0.72%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-12-04  0.56%  0.63%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.47%  0.56%  +0.09 \n 5  2023-10-12  0.45%  0.47%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  4.84%  0.45%  -4.38 \n 7  2023-02-22  10.74%  4.84%  -5.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/security/advisories/GHSA-4rf9-43m7-x828", "ref_desc": "Visual Studio Code Prisma Extension Remote Code Execution Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 prisma/language-tools \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma", "ref_desc": "Prisma - Visual Studio MarketplaceProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/pull/750", "ref_desc": "feat: introduce explicit allow prompts for custom binaries by pantharshit00 \u00b7 Pull Request #750 \u00b7 prisma/language-tools \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma-insider", "ref_desc": "Prisma - Insider - Visual Studio MarketplaceProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
