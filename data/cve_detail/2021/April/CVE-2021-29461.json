{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29461", "Description": "Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29461", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDemon1a\u00bbDiscord-recon\u00bbVersion:0.0.2cpe:2.3:a:demon1a:discord-recon:0.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-03  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.21%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DEMON1A/Discord-Recon/security/advisories/GHSA-3m9v-v33c-g83x", "ref_desc": "LFI and possible code execution on discord-recon using tools arguments \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DEMON1A/Discord-Recon \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
