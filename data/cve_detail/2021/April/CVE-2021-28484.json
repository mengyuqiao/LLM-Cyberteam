{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28484", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the /api/connector endpoint handler in Yubico yubihsm-connector before 3.0.1 (in YubiHSM SDK before 2021.04). The handler did not validate the length of the request, which can lead to a state where yubihsm-connector becomes stuck in a loop waiting for the YubiHSM to send it data, preventing any further operations until the yubihsm-connector is restarted. An attacker can send 0, 1, or 2 bytes to trigger this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28484", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nYubico\u00bbYubihsm ConnectorVersions  before (<) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:yubico:yubihsm_connector:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.18%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-12-29  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-19  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-10-24  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2021-02/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory YSA-2021-02 - YubicoVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-connector/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 Yubico/yubihsm-connector \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/B7Q2KGXSPQEEONAWMFZRVH2TXWX3QPCQ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: yubihsm-connector-3.0.1-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
