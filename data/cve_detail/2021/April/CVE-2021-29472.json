{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29472", "Description": "Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29472", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetcomposer\u00bbComposerVersions  before (<) 1.10.22cpe:2.3:a:getcomposer:composer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetcomposer\u00bbComposerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0andbefore (<) 2.0.13cpe:2.3:a:getcomposer:composer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "5.98% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  11.75%  5.98%  -5.77 \n 2  2024-05-30  8.65%  11.75%  +3.10 \n 3  2024-04-30  6.30%  8.65%  +2.35 \n 4  2023-11-08  1.99%  6.30%  +4.31 \n 5  2023-07-08  1.51%  1.99%  +0.48 \n 6  2023-05-08  1.99%  1.51%  -0.48 \n 7  2023-03-07  5.47%  1.99%  -3.48 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/php-supply-chain-attack-on-composer/", "ref_desc": "PHP Supply Chain Attack on ComposerExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4907", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4907-1 composerThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00009.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2654-1] composer security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FAQUAMGO4Q4BLNZ2OH4CXQD7UK4IO2GE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: composer-2.0.13-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-h5h8-pc6h-jvvx", "ref_desc": "Missing argument delimiter can lead to command execution via VCS repository URLs or source download URLs on systems with Mercurial \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 composer/composer \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KN3DMFH42BJW45VT6FYF2RXKC26D6VC2/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: composer-2.0.13-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://getcomposer.org/", "ref_desc": "ComposerVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
