{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24229", "Description": "The Jetpack Scan team identified a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the patreon_save_attachment_patreon_level AJAX action of the Patreon WordPress plugin before 1.7.2. This AJAX hook is used to update the pledge level required by Patreon subscribers to access a given attachment. This action is accessible for user accounts with the \u2018manage_options\u2019 privilege (i.e.., only administrators). Unfortunately, one of the parameters used in this AJAX endpoint is not sanitized before being printed back to the user, so the risk it represents is the same as the previous XSS vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24229", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPatreon\u00bbPatreon Wordpress\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 1.7.2cpe:2.3:a:patreon:patreon_wordpress:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.34%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-08-15  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-12-27  0.20%  0.19%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-11-17  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/001755c4-add3-4566-a022-ab1f83546c1f", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jetpack.com/2021/03/26/vulnerabilities-found-in-patreon-wordpress-plugin/", "ref_desc": "Vulnerabilities Found in Patreon WordPress\u00a0pluginExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Ux6HZFcGuEYM5bAC8m1JZcSeTGQ.html"}]}
