{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29468", "Description": "Cygwin Git is a patch set for the git command line tool for the cygwin environment. A specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as files with backslash characters in the file name may cause just-checked out code to be executed while checking out a repository using Git on Cygwin. The problem will be patched in the Cygwin Git v2.31.1-2 release. At time of writing, the vulnerability is present in the upstream Git source code; any Cygwin user who compiles Git for themselves from upstream sources should manually apply a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. As mitigation users should not clone or pull from repositories from untrusted sources. CVE-2019-1354 was an equivalent vulnerability in Git for Visual Studio.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29468", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCygwin\u00bbGITVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.31.1-1cpe:2.3:a:cygwin:git:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.23%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-09-16  0.23%  0.33%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-01-13  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-12-04  0.21%  0.21%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.20%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lore.kernel.org/git/CA+kUOa=juEdBMVr_gyTKjz7PkPt2DZHkXQyzcQmAWCsEHC_ssw@mail.gmail.com/T/#u", "ref_desc": "Security vulnerability in Git for CygwinMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin-announce/2021-April/010018.html", "ref_desc": "Security vulnerability in Git for CygwinMailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/me-and/Cygwin-Git/security/advisories/GHSA-rmp3-wq55-f557", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary code execution when checking out an attacker-controlled Git branch \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 me-and/Cygwin-Git \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/me-and/Cygwin-Git/blob/main/check-backslash-safety.patch", "ref_desc": "Cygwin-Git/check-backslash-safety.patch at main \u00b7 me-and/Cygwin-Git \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
