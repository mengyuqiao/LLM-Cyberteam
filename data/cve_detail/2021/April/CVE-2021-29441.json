{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29441", "Description": "Nacos is a platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration and service management. In Nacos before version 1.4.1, when configured to use authentication (-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true) Nacos uses the AuthFilter servlet filter to enforce authentication. This filter has a backdoor that enables Nacos servers to bypass this filter and therefore skip authentication checks. This mechanism relies on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily spoofed. This issue may allow any user to carry out any administrative tasks on the Nacos server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29441", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAlibaba\u00bbNacosVersions  before (<) 1.4.1cpe:2.3:a:alibaba:nacos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.05%  96.97%  -0.07 \n 2  2024-12-09  96.90%  97.05%  +0.15 \n 3  2024-11-04  96.87%  96.90%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-10-17  96.93%  96.87%  -0.06 \n 5  2024-09-30  97.00%  96.93%  -0.07 \n 6  2024-08-30  96.94%  97.00%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-07-29  96.88%  96.94%  +0.06 \n 8  2024-06-28  96.79%  96.88%  +0.09 \n 9  2024-05-30  96.60%  96.79%  +0.19 \n 10  2024-03-19  96.50%  96.60%  +0.10 \n 11  2024-02-06  96.71%  96.50%  -0.21 \n 12  2024-01-11  96.76%  96.71%  -0.05 \n 13  2023-12-02  96.64%  96.76%  +0.12 \n 14  2023-07-20  96.64%  96.64%  +0.00 \n 15  2023-06-07  96.44%  96.64%  +0.20 \n 16  2023-05-24  96.59%  96.44%  -0.15 \n 17  2023-05-11  96.77%  96.59%  -0.17 \n 18  2023-04-24  96.93%  96.77%  -0.16 \n 19  2023-03-27  97.06%  96.93%  -0.13 \n 20  2023-03-07  22.17%  97.06%  +74.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36hp-jr8h-556f", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass \u00b7 CVE-2021-29441 \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3ESGlFSwPZ9apbUm7q8GrcQ6jDI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/4703", "ref_desc": "[ISSUE #4701] Fix bypass authentication(identity) problem. by KomachiSion \u00b7 Pull Request #4703 \u00b7 alibaba/nacos \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/4701", "ref_desc": "Report a security vulnerability in nacos to bypass authentication(identity) again \u00b7 Issue #4701 \u00b7 alibaba/nacos \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
