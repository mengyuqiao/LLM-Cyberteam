{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29012", "Description": "DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session. The cookie is valid when the admin is logged in, but is invalid (temporarily) during times when the admin is logged out. In other words, the cookie is functionally equivalent to a static password, and thus provides permanent access if stolen.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29012", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDmasoftlab\u00bbDma Radius Manager\u00bbVersion:4.4.0cpe:2.3:a:dmasoftlab:dma_radius_manager:4.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "40.46% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-18  39.14%  40.46%  +1.32 \n 2  2024-12-17  38.30%  39.14%  +0.84 \n 3  2024-09-05  31.51%  38.30%  +6.79 \n 4  2024-08-05  27.84%  31.51%  +3.68 \n 5  2024-07-19  25.79%  27.84%  +2.04 \n 6  2024-07-04  20.22%  25.79%  +5.57 \n 7  2024-06-19  15.35%  20.22%  +4.87 \n 8  2024-02-23  11.68%  15.35%  +3.68 \n 9  2023-12-17  9.91%  11.68%  +1.76 \n 10  2023-11-07  9.17%  9.91%  +0.75 \n 11  2023-06-25  9.78%  9.17%  -0.61 \n 12  2023-04-29  7.15%  9.78%  +2.63 \n 13  2023-04-16  2.66%  7.15%  +4.49 \n 14  2023-03-18  1.34%  2.66%  +1.32 \n 15  2023-03-07  0.95%  1.34%  +0.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164154/DMA-Softlab-Radius-Manager-4.4.0-Session-Management-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 Session Management / Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CPM8JMCrFa40tFlpT9PAXZr4Llg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/radiusmanager/", "ref_desc": "DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.1.6 download | SourceForge.netProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GdlSKVd87meW8gbal-fUnOWbVYo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/1d8/publications/tree/main/cve-2021-29012", "ref_desc": "publications/cve-2021-29012 at main \u00b7 1d8/publications \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
