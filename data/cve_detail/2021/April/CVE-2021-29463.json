{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29463", "Description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29463", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nExiv2\u00bbExiv2Versions  before (<) 0.27.4cpe:2.3:a:exiv2:exiv2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-14  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-23  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-05  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-09  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K3HKXR6JOVKMBE4HY4FDXNVZGNCQG6T3/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: mingw-exiv2-0.27.4-2.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_mPZx2kWcO3hLj1NnOJhWe1Fuio.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K3HKXR6JOVKMBE4HY4FDXNVZGNCQG6T3/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: mingw-exiv2-0.27.4-2.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dFYTvHd51a7Kd5nfInP0-4-edvY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDMZTVQAZSMLPTDVDYLBHAAF7I5QXVYQ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: mingw-exiv2-0.27.4-2.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jLxVNF5QoLGOlZvs84-YY4gqeAs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06", "ref_desc": "Exiv2: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202312-06) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pWbz1VGAGOJZ_ceLObIg2z0V9Pk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDMZTVQAZSMLPTDVDYLBHAAF7I5QXVYQ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: mingw-exiv2-0.27.4-2.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/S9Is7I9mK318yOv1Rc7Rd6nJ9Jw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/commit/783b3a6ff15ed6f82a8f8e6c8a6f3b84a9b04d4b", "ref_desc": "Improve bound checking in WebPImage::doWriteMetadata() \u00b7 Exiv2/exiv2@783b3a6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-5p8g-9xf3-gfrr", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::WebPImage::doWriteMetadata \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Exiv2/exiv2 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
