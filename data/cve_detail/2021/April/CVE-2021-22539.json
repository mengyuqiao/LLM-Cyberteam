{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22539", "Description": "An attacker can place a crafted JSON config file into the project folder pointing to a custom executable. VScode-bazel allows the workspace path to lint *.bzl files to be set via this config file. As such the attacker is able to execute any executable on the system through vscode-bazel. We recommend upgrading to version 0.4.1 or above.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22539", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbBazel\u00bbForVisual StudioVersions  from including (>=) 0.1.0andbefore (<) 0.4.1cpe:2.3:a:google:bazel:*:*:*:*:*:visual_studio:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-31  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/73/External-Control-of-File-Name-or-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bazelbuild/vscode-bazel/security/advisories/GHSA-2rcw-j8x4-hgcv", "ref_desc": "Malicious project can cause vscode-bazel to run arbitrary executable when linting a *.bzl file \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bazelbuild/vscode-bazel \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bazelbuild/vscode-bazel-ghsa-2rcw-j8x4-hgcv/pull/1", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
