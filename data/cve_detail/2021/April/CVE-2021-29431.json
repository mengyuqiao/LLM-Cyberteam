{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29431", "Description": "Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent can be induced to send HTTP GET requests to internal systems, due to lack of parameter validation or IP address blacklisting. It is not possible to exfiltrate data or control request headers, but it might be possible to use the attack to perform an internal port enumeration. This issue has been addressed in in 9e57334, 8936925, 3d531ed, 0f00412. A potential workaround would be to use a firewall to ensure that Sydent cannot reach internal HTTP resources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29431", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSydentVersions  before (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:sydent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.10%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/commit/9e573348d81df8191bbe8c266c01999c9d57cd5f", "ref_desc": "Rework hostname validation to make port checking stricter. \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent@9e57334 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/commit/3d531ed50d2fd41ac387f36d44d3fb2c62dd22d3", "ref_desc": "Add BlacklistingReactor \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent@3d531ed \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/matrix-sydent/", "ref_desc": "matrix-sydent \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mI_E45BtgWItHm0ZiFYTtMbIaWE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/security/advisories/GHSA-9jhm-8m8c-c3f4", "ref_desc": "SSRF due to missing validation of hostnames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/commit/8936925f561b0c352c2fa922d5097d7245aad00a", "ref_desc": "Validate hostname in more places \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent@8936925 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.3.0", "ref_desc": "Release Sydent 2.3.0 (2021-04-15) \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rMhH2zc5q-ne1tq5Lp1-SVBbm3s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/commit/0f00412017f25619bc36c264b29ea96808bf310a", "ref_desc": "Allow IPv6 literals as Matrix server names. \u00b7 matrix-org/sydent@0f00412 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
