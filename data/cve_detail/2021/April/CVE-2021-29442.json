{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29442", "Description": "Nacos is a platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration and service management. In Nacos before version 1.4.1, the ConfigOpsController lets the user perform management operations like querying the database or even wiping it out. While the /data/remove endpoint is properly protected with the @Secured annotation, the /derby endpoint is not protected and can be openly accessed by unauthenticated users. These endpoints are only valid when using embedded storage (derby DB) so this issue should not affect those installations using external storage (e.g. mysql)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29442", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAlibaba\u00bbNacosVersions  before (<) 1.4.1cpe:2.3:a:alibaba:nacos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "96.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  96.72%  96.42%  -0.31 \n 2  2024-12-09  96.61%  96.72%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-11-22  96.88%  96.61%  -0.28 \n 4  2024-09-30  96.98%  96.88%  -0.10 \n 5  2024-08-30  96.93%  96.98%  +0.05 \n 6  2024-07-29  96.81%  96.93%  +0.12 \n 7  2024-06-28  96.72%  96.81%  +0.09 \n 8  2024-03-19  96.76%  96.72%  -0.04 \n 9  2024-01-11  96.80%  96.76%  -0.04 \n 10  2023-12-16  96.87%  96.80%  -0.06 \n 11  2023-12-02  96.99%  96.87%  -0.13 \n 12  2023-08-17  96.97%  96.99%  +0.03 \n 13  2023-07-20  96.98%  96.97%  -0.02 \n 14  2023-06-21  97.04%  96.98%  -0.06 \n 15  2023-05-24  97.05%  97.04%  -0.01 \n 16  2023-04-24  97.16%  97.05%  -0.10 \n 17  2023-03-27  97.24%  97.16%  -0.09 \n 18  2023-03-07  0.95%  97.24%  +96.29 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36hp-jr8h-556f", "ref_desc": "Authentication Bypass \u00b7 CVE-2021-29441 \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3ESGlFSwPZ9apbUm7q8GrcQ6jDI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/4463", "ref_desc": "Report a security vulnerability in nacos to execute arbitrary SQL without authentication \u00b7 Issue #4463 \u00b7 alibaba/nacos \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/4517", "ref_desc": "[ISSUE #4463] fix derbyOps interface security problem by haoyann \u00b7 Pull Request #4517 \u00b7 alibaba/nacos \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
