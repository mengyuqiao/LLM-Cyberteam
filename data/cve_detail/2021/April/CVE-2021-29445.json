{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29445", "Description": "jose-node-esm-runtime is an npm package which provides a number of cryptographic functions. In versions prior to 3.11.4 the AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithm (A128CBC-HS256, A192CBC-HS384, A256CBC-HS512) decryption would always execute both HMAC tag verification and CBC decryption, if either failed `JWEDecryptionFailed` would be thrown. But a possibly observable difference in timing when padding error would occur while decrypting the ciphertext makes a padding oracle and an adversary might be able to make use of that oracle to decrypt data without knowing the decryption key by issuing on average 128*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block). A patch was released which ensures the HMAC tag is verified before performing CBC decryption. The fixed versions are `>=3.11.4`. Users should upgrade to `^3.11.4`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29445", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJose-node-cjs-runtime Project\u00bbJose-node-cjs-runtime\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.11.4cpe:2.3:a:jose-node-cjs-runtime_project:jose-node-cjs-runtime:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-31  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-21  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/panva/jose/security/advisories/GHSA-4v4g-726h-xvfv", "ref_desc": "Padding Oracle Attack due to Observable Timing Discrepancy in jose-node-esm-runtime \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 panva/jose \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose-node-esm-runtime", "ref_desc": "jose-node-esm-runtime - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
