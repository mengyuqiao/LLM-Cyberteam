{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29439", "Description": "The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29439", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGetgrav\u00bbGrav AdminVersions  before (<) 1.10.11cpe:2.3:a:getgrav:grav_admin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-07  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.12%  -1.32 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin/commit/a220359877fd1281f76ba732e5308e0e3002e4b1", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'release/1.10.11' \u00b7 getgrav/grav-plugin-admin@a220359 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/grav-cms-code-execution-vulnerabilities", "ref_desc": "Grav CMS 1.7.10 - Code Execution VulnerabilitiesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U2IDuVZvLu4z89bEeeDWoGTdoz8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin/security/advisories/GHSA-wg37-cf5x-55hq", "ref_desc": "Plugins can be installed with minimal admin privileges \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getgrav/grav-plugin-admin \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
