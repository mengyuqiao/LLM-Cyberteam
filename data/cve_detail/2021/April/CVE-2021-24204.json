{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24204", "Description": "In the Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.1.4, the accordion widget (includes/widgets/accordion.php) accepts a \u2018title_html_tag\u2019 parameter. Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified \u2018save_builder\u2019 request containing JavaScript in the \u2018title_html_tag\u2019 parameter, which is not filtered and is output without escaping. This JavaScript will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24204", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nElementor\u00bbWebsite Builder\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 3.1.4cpe:2.3:a:elementor:website_builder:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/03/cross-site-scripting-vulnerabilities-in-elementor-impact-over-7-million-sites/", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities in Elementor Impact Over 7 Million SitesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rLUMnOrVu3-85cKF2hpBsrAs5F0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/772e172f-c8b4-4a6a-9eb9-9663295cfedf", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
