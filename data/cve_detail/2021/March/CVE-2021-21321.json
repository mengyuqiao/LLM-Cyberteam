{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21321", "Description": "fastify-reply-from is an npm package which is a fastify plugin to forward the current http request to another server. In fastify-reply-from before version 4.0.2, by crafting a specific URL, it is possible to escape the prefix of the proxied backend service. If the base url of the proxied server is \"/pub/\", a user expect that accessing \"/priv\" on the target service would not be possible. In affected versions, it is possible. This is fixed in version 4.0.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21321", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nFastify-reply-from Project\u00bbFastify-reply-from\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.0.2cpe:2.3:a:fastify-reply-from_project:fastify-reply-from:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-07-20  0.22%  0.32%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-11-15  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-06  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-10  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.19%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify-reply-from", "ref_desc": "fastify-reply-from - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-reply-from/security/advisories/GHSA-qmw8-3v4g-gwj4", "ref_desc": "Prefix escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fastify/fastify-reply-from \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-reply-from/commit/dea227dda606900cc01870d08541b4dcc69d3889", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qmw8-3v4g-gwj4 \u00b7 fastify/fastify-reply-from@dea227d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
