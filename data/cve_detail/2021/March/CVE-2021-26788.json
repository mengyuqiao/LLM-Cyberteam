{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-26788", "Description": "Oryx Embedded CycloneTCP 1.7.6 to 2.0.0, fixed in 2.0.2, is affected by incorrect input validation, which may cause a denial of service (DoS). To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to have TCP connectivity to the target system. Receiving a maliciously crafted TCP packet from an unauthenticated endpoint is sufficient to trigger the bug.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26788", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOryx-embedded\u00bbCyclonetcpVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.6andup to, including, (<=) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:oryx-embedded:cyclonetcp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2023-11-22  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-13  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Oryx-Embedded/CycloneTCP/commit/de5336016edbe1e90327d0ed1cba5c4e49114366?branch=de5336016edbe1e90327d0ed1cba5c4e49114366&diff=split", "ref_desc": "Version 2.0.2 \u00b7 Oryx-Embedded/CycloneTCP@de53360 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
