{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1382", "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed with root privileges on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and submitting crafted input to the CLI. The attacker must be authenticated as an administrative user to execute the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1382", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  from including (>=) 17.6.0andbefore (<) 17.6.1acpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  before (<) 17.3.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  from including (>=) 17.5.0andbefore (<) 17.5.1acpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  from including (>=) 17.4.1andup to, including, (<=) 17.4.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.44% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.44%  +0.25 \n 2  2024-11-21  0.15%  0.19%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-10-01  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-10  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-03-12  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-08-24  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xesdwcinj-t68PPW7m", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfm-92p7-qc57", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN - Command Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2021-1382) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 orangecertcc/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
