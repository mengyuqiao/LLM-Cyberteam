{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-23360", "Description": "This affects the package killport before 1.0.2. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This is due to use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization. Running this PoC will cause the command touch success to be executed, leading to the creation of a file called success.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23360", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKillport Project\u00bbKillport\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.0.2cpe:2.3:a:killport_project:killport:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  1.16%  +0.94 \n 2  2024-10-16  0.22%  0.22%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-24  0.25%  0.22%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-02-11  0.26%  0.25%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.26%  -0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ssnau/killport/commit/bec8e371f170a12e11cd222ffc7a6e1ae9942638", "ref_desc": "fix a vulnerability issue if a provided port is not a number \u00b7 ssnau/killport@bec8e37 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ssnau/killport/blob/5268f23ea8f152e47182b263d8f7ef20c12a9f28/index.js%23L9", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-KILLPORT-1078535", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary Command Injection in killport | SnykExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
