{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21381", "Description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. In Flatpack since version 0.9.4 and before version 1.10.2 has a vulnerability in the \"file forwarding\" feature which can be used by an attacker to gain access to files that would not ordinarily be allowed by the app's permissions. By putting the special tokens `@@` and/or `@@u` in the Exec field of a Flatpak app's .desktop file, a malicious app publisher can trick flatpak into behaving as though the user had chosen to open a target file with their Flatpak app, which automatically makes that file available to the Flatpak app. This is fixed in version 1.10.2. A minimal solution is the first commit \"`Disallow @@ and @@U usage in desktop files`\". The follow-up commits \"`dir: Reserve the whole @@ prefix`\" and \"`dir: Refuse to export .desktop files with suspicious uses of @@ tokens`\" are recommended, but not strictly required. As a workaround, avoid installing Flatpak apps from untrusted sources, or check the contents of the exported `.desktop` files in `exports/share/applications/*.desktop` (typically `~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop` and `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop`) to make sure that literal filenames do not follow `@@` or `@@u`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21381", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 0.9.4andbefore (<) 1.10.2cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.12%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-11-25  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-16  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-20  0.08%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.54%  0.08%  -1.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/a7401e638bf0c03102039e216ab1081922f140ae", "ref_desc": "dir: Refuse to export .desktop files with suspicious uses of @@ tokens \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@a7401e6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2MXXLXC2DPJ45HSMTI5MZYHMYEGQN6AA/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: flatpak-1.10.2-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WXNVFOIB6ZP4DGOVKAM25T6OIEP3YLGV/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: flatpak-1.10.2-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-xgh4-387p-hqpp", "ref_desc": "Sandbox escape via special tokens in .desktop file (flatpak#4146) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/4156", "ref_desc": "Disallow @@ and @@u magic tokens in desktop files by smcv \u00b7 Pull Request #4156 \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WXNVFOIB6ZP4DGOVKAM25T6OIEP3YLGV/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: flatpak-1.10.2-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4868", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4868-1 flatpakThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-12", "ref_desc": "Flatpak: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202312-12) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QhrImzUJpyGPk8qiCq8575VbcGg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/1.10.2", "ref_desc": "Release Release 1.10.2 \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/eb7946bb6248923d8c90fe9b84425fef97ae580d", "ref_desc": "dir: Reserve the whole @@ prefix \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@eb7946b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2MXXLXC2DPJ45HSMTI5MZYHMYEGQN6AA/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: flatpak-1.10.2-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/8279c5818425b6812523e3805bbe242fb6a5d961", "ref_desc": "Disallow @@ and @@u usage in desktop files \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@8279c58 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
