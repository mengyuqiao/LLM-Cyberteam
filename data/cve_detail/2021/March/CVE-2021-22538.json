{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22538", "Description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability impacting the Google Exposure Notification Verification Server (versions prior to 0.23.1), allows an attacker who (1) has UserWrite permissions and (2) is using a carefully crafted request or malicious proxy, to create another user with higher privileges than their own. This occurs due to insufficient checks on the allowed set of permissions. The new user creation event would be captured in the Event Log.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22538", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbExposure Notifications Verification ServerVersions  before (<) 0.23.1cpe:2.3:a:google:exposure_notifications_verification_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.13%  -0.13 \n 2  2024-08-18  0.18%  0.26%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-12-02  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/commit/eb8cf40b12dbe79304f1133c06fb73419383cd95", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5v95-v8c8-3rh6 \u00b7 google/exposure-notifications-verification-server@eb8cf40 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/releases/tag/v0.23.1", "ref_desc": "Release v0.23.1 \u00b7 google/exposure-notifications-verification-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/security/advisories/GHSA-5v95-v8c8-3rh6", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation in rbac \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 google/exposure-notifications-verification-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/releases/tag/v0.24.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.24.0 \u00b7 google/exposure-notifications-verification-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
