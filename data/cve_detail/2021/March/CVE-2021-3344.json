{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-3344", "Description": "A privilege escalation flaw was found in OpenShift builder. During build time, credentials outside the build context are automatically mounted into the container image under construction. An OpenShift user, able to execute code during build time inside this container can re-use the credentials to overwrite arbitrary container images in internal registries and/or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. This affects github.com/openshift/builder v0.0.0-20210125201112-7901cb396121 and before.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3344", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 4.5andbefore (<) 4.5.33cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 4.6andbefore (<) 4.6.16cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift BuilderVersions  before (<) 2021-01-26cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_builder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-03  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-07-19  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.09%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921450", "ref_desc": "1921450 \u2013 (CVE-2021-3344) CVE-2021-3344 openshift/builder: privilege escalation during container image builds via mounted secretsIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
