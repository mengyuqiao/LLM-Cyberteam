{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21401", "Description": "Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in ansi C. In Nanopb before versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5, decoding a specifically formed message can cause invalid `free()` or `realloc()` calls if the message type contains an `oneof` field, and the `oneof` directly contains both a pointer field and a non-pointer field. If the message data first contains the non-pointer field and then the pointer field, the data of the non-pointer field is incorrectly treated as if it was a pointer value. Such message data rarely occurs in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed. This has been fixed in versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5. See referenced GitHub Security Advisory for more information including workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21401", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNanopb Project\u00bbNanopbVersions  from including (>=) 0.4.0andbefore (<) 0.4.5cpe:2.3:a:nanopb_project:nanopb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNanopb Project\u00bbNanopbVersions  before (<) 0.3.9.8cpe:2.3:a:nanopb_project:nanopb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-12-08  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-06-15  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-763 Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/763/Release-of-Invalid-Pointer-or-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/commit/e2f0ccf939d9f82931d085acb6df8e9a182a4261", "ref_desc": "Fix invalid free() with oneof (#647) \u00b7 nanopb/nanopb@e2f0ccf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/issues/647", "ref_desc": "Ill-formed oneof message leads to calling free on an arbitrary pointer \u00b7 Issue #647 \u00b7 nanopb/nanopb \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/security/advisories/GHSA-7mv5-5mxh-qg88", "ref_desc": "Invalid free() call with oneofs and PB_ENABLE_MALLOC \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nanopb/nanopb \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/blob/c9124132a604047d0ef97a09c0e99cd9bed2c818/CHANGELOG.txt#L1", "ref_desc": "nanopb/CHANGELOG.txt at c9124132a604047d0ef97a09c0e99cd9bed2c818 \u00b7 nanopb/nanopb \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
