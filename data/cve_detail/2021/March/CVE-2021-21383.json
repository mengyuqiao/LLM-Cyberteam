{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21383", "Description": "Wiki.js an open-source wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js before version 2.5.191 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through mustache expressions in code blocks. This vulnerability exists due to mustache expressions being parsed by Vue during content injection even though it is contained within a `<pre>` element. By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. For an example see referenced GitHub Security Advisory. Commit 5ffa189383dd716f12b56b8cae2ba0d075996cf1 fixes this vulnerability by adding the v-pre directive to all `<pre>` tags during the render.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21383", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRequarks\u00bbWiki.jsVersions  before (<) 2.5.191cpe:2.3:a:requarks:wiki.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-6xx4-m8gx-826r", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS through code blocks with mustache expressions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/releases/tag/2.5.191", "ref_desc": "Release 2.5.191 \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/5ffa189383dd716f12b56b8cae2ba0d075996cf1", "ref_desc": "fix: add v-pre to pre tags at render time \u00b7 Requarks/wiki@5ffa189 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
