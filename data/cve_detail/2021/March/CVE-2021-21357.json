{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21357", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In TYPO3 before versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 due to improper input validation, attackers can by-pass restrictions of predefined options and submit arbitrary data in the Form Designer backend module of the Form Framework. In the default configuration of the Form Framework this allows attackers to explicitly allow arbitrary mime-types for file uploads - however, default _fileDenyPattern_ successfully blocked files like _.htaccess_ or _malicious.php_. Besides that, attackers can persist those files in any writable directory of the corresponding TYPO3 installation. A valid backend user account with access to the form module is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21357", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.25cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.14cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.7.40cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.1.1cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-08-10  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/cms-form", "ref_desc": "typo3/cms-form - PackagistRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DKbegb_Nm-oaeS3Id0uGa1sD62w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-003", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-003: Broken Access Control in Form FrameworkVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-3vg7-jw9m-pc3f", "ref_desc": "Broken Access Control in Form Framework \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
