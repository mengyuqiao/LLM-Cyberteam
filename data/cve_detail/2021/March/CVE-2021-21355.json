{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21355", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In TYPO3 before versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1, due to the lack of ensuring file extensions belong to configured allowed mime-types, attackers can upload arbitrary data with arbitrary file extensions - however, default _fileDenyPattern_ successfully blocked files like _.htaccess_ or _malicious.php_. Besides that, _UploadedFileReferenceConverter_ transforming uploaded files into proper FileReference domain model objects handles possible file uploads for other extensions as well - given those extensions use the Extbase MVC framework, make use of FileReference items in their direct or inherited domain model definitions and did not implement their own type converter. In case this scenario applies, _UploadedFileReferenceConverter_ accepts any file mime-type and persists files in the default location. In any way, uploaded files are placed in the default location _/fileadmin/user_upload/_, in most scenarios keeping the submitted filename - which allows attackers to directly reference files, or even correctly guess filenames used by other individuals, disclosing this information. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21355", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.25cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.14cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.7.40cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.1.1cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-27  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-002", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-002: Unrestricted File Upload in Form FrameworkVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/cms-form", "ref_desc": "typo3/cms-form - PackagistRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DKbegb_Nm-oaeS3Id0uGa1sD62w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-2r6j-862c-m2v2", "ref_desc": "Unrestricted File Upload in Form Framework \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
