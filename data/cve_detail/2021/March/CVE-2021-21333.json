{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21333", "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21333", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.27.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-12-10  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.27.0 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0smCJR-jGVU-6_GLMwAs4wEPdgM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-c5f8-35qr-q4fm", "ref_desc": "HTML injection in email and account expiry notifications \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/e54746bdf7d5c831eabe4dcea76a7626f1de73df", "ref_desc": "Clean-up the template loading code.
