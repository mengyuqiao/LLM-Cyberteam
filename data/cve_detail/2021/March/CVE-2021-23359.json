{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-23359", "Description": "This affects all versions of package port-killer. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This is due to use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization. Running this PoC will cause the command touch success to be executed, leading to the creation of a file called success.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23359", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPort-killer Project\u00bbPort-killer\u00bbForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:port-killer_project:port-killer:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.51%  2.80%  +2.28 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.73%  0.51%  -0.21 \n 3  2024-07-21  0.80%  0.73%  -0.08 \n 4  2024-06-04  0.57%  0.80%  +0.24 \n 5  2024-02-08  0.41%  0.57%  +0.16 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.41%  -0.48 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tylerjpeterson/port-killer/blob/1ca3a99ad80cc9ed5498d12b185189c10329025b/index.js%23L19", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PORTKILLER-1078533", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary Command Injection in port-killer | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
