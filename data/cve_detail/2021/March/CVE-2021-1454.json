{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1454", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access the underlying operating system with root privileges. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation of certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the device and submitting crafted input to the CLI. The attacker must be authenticated as an administrative user to execute the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the underlying operating system with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1454", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe Sd-wan\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe_sd-wan:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xesdwpinj-V4weeqzU", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software Parameter Injection VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UuBAKopgzV-rZXBAg57mXue3spY.html"}]}
