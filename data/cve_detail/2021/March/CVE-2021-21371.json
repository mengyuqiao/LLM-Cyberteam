{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21371", "Description": "Tenable for Jira Cloud is an open source project designed to pull Tenable.io vulnerability data, then generate Jira Tasks and sub-tasks based on the vulnerabilities' current state. It published in pypi as \"tenable-jira-cloud\". In tenable-jira-cloud before version 1.1.21, it is possible to run arbitrary commands through the yaml.load() method. This could allow an attacker with local access to the host to run arbitrary code by running the application with a specially crafted YAML configuration file. This is fixed in version 1.1.21 by using yaml.safe_load() instead of yaml.load().", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21371", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTenable\u00bbJira CloudVersions  before (<) 1.1.21cpe:2.3:a:tenable:jira_cloud:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-24  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pyyaml.docsforge.com/master/documentation/#loading-yaml", "ref_desc": "Documentation - PyYAML - DocsForgeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/tenable-jira-cloud/", "ref_desc": "tenable-jira-cloud \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tenable/integration-jira-cloud/security/advisories/GHSA-8278-88vv-x98r", "ref_desc": "Execution of untrusted code through config file \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tenable/integration-jira-cloud \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tenable/integration-jira-cloud/commit/f8c2095fd529e664e7fa25403a0a4a85bb3907d0", "ref_desc": "switched yaml.load() to yaml.safe_load() to not load serialized pytho\u2026 \u00b7 tenable/integration-jira-cloud@f8c2095 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
