{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21390", "Description": "MinIO is an open-source high performance object storage service and it is API compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z, there is a vulnerability which enables MITM modification of request bodies that are meant to have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. In a PUT request using aws-chunked encoding, MinIO ordinarily verifies signatures at the end of a chunk. This check can be skipped if the client sends a false chunk size that is much greater than the actual data sent: the server accepts and completes the request without ever reaching the end of the chunk + thereby without ever checking the chunk signature. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z. As a workaround one can avoid using \"aws-chunked\" encoding-based chunk signature upload requests instead use TLS. MinIO SDKs automatically disable chunked encoding signature when the server endpoint is configured with TLS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21390", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinioVersions  before (<) 2021-03-17t02-33-02zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-12-04  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-10-24  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-924 Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/924/Improper-Enforcement-of-Message-Integrity-During-Transmissio.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/e197800f9055489415b53cf137e31e194aaf7ba0", "ref_desc": "s3v4: read and verify S3 signature v4 chunks separately (#11801) \u00b7 minio/minio@e197800 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/11801", "ref_desc": "s3v4: read and verify S3 signature v4 chunks separately by aead \u00b7 Pull Request #11801 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-7gpj-5pgp", "ref_desc": "Chunked body signature check not always applied \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
