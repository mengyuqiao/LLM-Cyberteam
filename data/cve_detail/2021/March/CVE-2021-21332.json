{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21332", "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21332", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.27.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-10  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-31  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.27.0 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0smCJR-jGVU-6_GLMwAs4wEPdgM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/e54746bdf7d5c831eabe4dcea76a7626f1de73df", "ref_desc": "Clean-up the template loading code.
