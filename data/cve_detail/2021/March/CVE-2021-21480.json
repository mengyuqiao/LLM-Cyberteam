{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21480", "Description": "SAP MII allows users to create dashboards and save them as JSP through the SSCE (Self Service Composition Environment). An attacker can intercept a request to the server, inject malicious JSP code in the request and forward to server. When this dashboard is opened by users having at least SAP_XMII Developer role, malicious content in the dashboard gets executed, leading to remote code execution in the server, which allows privilege escalation. The malicious JSP code can contain certain OS commands, through which an attacker can read sensitive files in the server, modify files or even delete contents in the server thus compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the server hosting the SAP MII application. Also, an attacker authenticated as a developer can use the application to upload and execute a file which will permit them to execute operating systems commands completely compromising the server hosting the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21480", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbManufacturing Integration And Intelligence\u00bbVersion:15.2cpe:2.3:a:sap:manufacturing_integration_and_intelligence:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbManufacturing Integration And Intelligence\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:a:sap:manufacturing_integration_and_intelligence:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbManufacturing Integration And Intelligence\u00bbVersion:15.3cpe:2.3:a:sap:manufacturing_integration_and_intelligence:15.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbManufacturing Integration And Intelligence\u00bbVersion:15.4cpe:2.3:a:sap:manufacturing_integration_and_intelligence:15.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.67%  2.48%  +0.81 \n 2  2024-11-24  1.62%  1.67%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-09-16  1.81%  1.62%  -0.19 \n 4  2024-08-12  1.55%  1.81%  +0.27 \n 5  2024-06-10  1.69%  1.55%  -0.14 \n 6  2024-05-10  1.46%  1.69%  +0.22 \n 7  2024-03-26  1.61%  1.46%  -0.15 \n 8  2024-02-26  1.30%  1.61%  +0.32 \n 9  2024-02-13  1.28%  1.30%  +0.01 \n 10  2024-01-30  1.19%  1.28%  +0.10 \n 11  2023-12-19  1.02%  1.19%  +0.16 \n 12  2023-03-07  4.57%  1.02%  -3.55 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163164/SAP-XMII-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "SAP XMII Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=571343107", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Patch Day \u2013 March 2021 - Product Security Response at SAP - Community WikiVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kusMDYL009wsQ9ZSUCTaFiEz7nA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Jun/30", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Onapsis Security Advisory 2021-0012: SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence lack of server side validations leads to RCEMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/02/fa865ea4-167e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html", "ref_desc": "SAP Patch Day BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sSrRPvgCRYFgD7GfxMc3pkzb8gk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3022622", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
