{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21385", "Description": "Mifos-Mobile Android Application for MifosX is an Android Application built on top of the MifosX Self-Service platform. Mifos-Mobile before commit e505f62 disables HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP client. Additionally it accepted any self-signed certificate as valid. Hostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. Accepting any certificate, even self-signed ones allows man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is fixed in mifos-mobile commit e505f62.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21385", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMifos\u00bbMifos-mobile\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 2021-03-14cpe:2.3:a:mifos:mifos-mobile:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-08  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2023-10-29  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-297 Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/297/Improper-Validation-of-Certificate-with-Host-Mismatch.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile/commit/e505f62b92b19292bfdabd6e996ab76abfeaa90d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-9657-33wf-rmvx \u00b7 openMF/mifos-mobile@e505f62 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile/security/advisories/GHSA-9657-33wf-rmvx", "ref_desc": "Disabled hostname verification and accepting self-signed certificates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openMF/mifos-mobile \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://openmf.github.io/mobileapps.github.io/", "ref_desc": "Mobile Applications | Mifos Mobile AppsProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
