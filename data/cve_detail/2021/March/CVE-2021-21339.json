{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21339", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In TYPO3 before versions 6.2.57, 7.6.51, 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 user session identifiers were stored in cleartext - without processing of additional cryptographic hashing algorithms. This vulnerability cannot be exploited directly and occurs in combination with a chained attack - like for instance SQL injection in any other component of the system. This is fixed in versions 6.2.57, 7.6.51, 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21339", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.6.51cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.25cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.14cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 6.2.0andbefore (<) 6.2.57cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.7.40cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.1.1cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-06  0.17%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-10-27  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-01  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.16%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-006", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-006: Cleartext storage of session identifierVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/cms-core", "ref_desc": "typo3/cms-core - PackagistRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/N8N_JvE4g98Y_a7CIQtuPeX-mPU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-qx3w-4864-94ch", "ref_desc": "Cleartext storage of session identifier \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
