{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21396", "Description": "wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. In wire-server from version 2021-02-16 and before version 2021-03-02, the client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint. The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID. The exposed metadata included id, class, type, location, time, and cookie. A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users. As a workaround, remove `/list-clients` from nginx config. This has been fixed in version 2021-03-02.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21396", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nWire\u00bbWire ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2021-02-16andbefore (<) 2021-03-02cpe:2.3:a:wire:wire_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/commit/7ba2bf4140282557cf215e0b2c354d4d08cd3421", "ref_desc": "Return PubClient instead of Client from /users/list-clients (#1391) \u00b7 wireapp/wire-server@7ba2bf4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qx8q-rhq2-rg4j", "ref_desc": "Bulk list client endpoint exposes too much metadata about a client \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wireapp/wire-server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases/tag/v2021-03-02", "ref_desc": "Release 2021-03-02 \u00b7 wireapp/wire-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
