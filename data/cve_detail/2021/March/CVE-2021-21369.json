{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21369", "Description": "Hyperledger Besu is an open-source, MainNet compatible, Ethereum client written in Java. In Besu before version 1.5.1 there is a denial-of-service vulnerability involving the HTTP JSON-RPC API service. If username and password authentication is enabled for the HTTP JSON-RPC API service, then prior to making any requests to an API endpoint the requestor must use the login endpoint to obtain a JSON web token (JWT) using their credentials. A single user can readily overload the login endpoint with invalid requests (incorrect password). As the supplied password is checked for validity on the main vertx event loop and takes a relatively long time this can cause the processing of other valid requests to fail. A valid username is required for this vulnerability to be exposed. This has been fixed in version 1.5.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21369", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbBesuVersions  before (<) 1.5.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:besu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#151", "ref_desc": "besu/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 hyperledger/besu \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1144", "ref_desc": "Improvements to authenticated JSON-RPC permissions checking by macfarla \u00b7 Pull Request #1144 \u00b7 hyperledger/besu \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/commit/06e35a58c07a30c0fbdc0aae45a3e8b06b53c022", "ref_desc": "Improvements to authenticated JSON-RPC permissions checking (#1144) \u00b7 hyperledger/besu@06e35a5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/security/advisories/GHSA-qgfj-mjpc-7w3q", "ref_desc": "Potential DoS in Besu HTTP JSON-RPC API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hyperledger/besu \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
