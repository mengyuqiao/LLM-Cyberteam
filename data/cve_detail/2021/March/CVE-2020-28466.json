{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28466", "Description": "This affects all versions of package github.com/nats-io/nats-server/server. Untrusted accounts are able to crash the server using configs that represent a service export/import cycles. Disclaimer from the maintainers: Running a NATS service which is exposed to untrusted users presents a heightened risk. Any remote execution flaw or equivalent seriousness, or denial-of-service by unauthenticated users, will lead to prompt releases by the NATS maintainers. Fixes for denial of service issues with no threat of remote execution, when limited to account holders, are likely to just be committed to the main development branch with no special attention. Those who are running such services are encouraged to build regularly from git.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28466", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNats\u00bbNats ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.0cpe:2.3:a:nats:nats_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.91% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.91%  1.91%  0.00 \n 2  2024-05-08  1.80%  1.91%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-02-24  1.40%  1.80%  +0.40 \n 4  2024-02-11  1.32%  1.40%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-11-21  1.11%  1.32%  +0.21 \n 6  2023-11-08  1.15%  1.11%  -0.04 \n 7  2023-10-12  1.12%  1.15%  +0.04 \n 8  2023-10-01  1.11%  1.12%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-09-16  0.94%  1.11%  +0.17 \n 10  2023-08-20  0.91%  0.94%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-03-07  3.69%  0.91%  -2.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/16/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2020-28466][CVE-2021-3127] NATS.io vulnerabilitiesMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMNATSIONATSSERVERSERVER-1042967", "ref_desc": "SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/16/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [CVE-2020-28466][CVE-2021-3127] NATS.io vulnerabilitiesMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/pull/1731", "ref_desc": "[FIXED] Detect service import cycles. by derekcollison \u00b7 Pull Request #1731 \u00b7 nats-io/nats-server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
