{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21359", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In TYPO3 before versions 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler which again could retrieve content to be shown as error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. This is fixed in versions 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21359", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.25cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.14cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.1.1cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-06  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-10-27  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-01  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.10%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-405 Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/405/Asymmetric-Resource-Consumption-Amplification-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-005", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-005: Denial of Service in Page Error HandlingVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/cms-core", "ref_desc": "typo3/cms-core - PackagistRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/N8N_JvE4g98Y_a7CIQtuPeX-mPU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-4p9g-qgx9-397p", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service in Page Error Handling \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
