{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-23355", "Description": "This affects all versions of package ps-kill. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the kill function, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This is due to use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization in the index.js file. PoC (provided by reporter): var ps_kill = require('ps-kill'); ps_kill.kill('$(touch success)',function(){});", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23355", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPs-kill Project\u00bbPs-kill\u00bbForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:ps-kill_project:ps-kill:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "6.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.46%  6.36%  +5.90 \n 2  2024-07-18  0.50%  0.46%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-02-05  0.36%  0.50%  +0.14 \n 4  2023-12-25  0.39%  0.36%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-11-29  0.36%  0.39%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-10-20  0.29%  0.36%  +0.07 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.29%  -0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PSKILL-1078529", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary Command Injection in ps-kill | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
