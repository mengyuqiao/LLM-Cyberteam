{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28032", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the nano_arena crate before 0.5.2 for Rust. There is an aliasing violation in split_at because two mutable references can exist for the same element, if Borrow<Idx> behaves in certain ways. This can have a resultant out-of-bounds write or use-after-free.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28032", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nNano Arena Project\u00bbNano Arena\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.5.2cpe:2.3:a:nano_arena_project:nano_arena:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.87% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.47%  0.87%  +0.40 \n 2  2024-07-08  0.44%  0.47%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-01-26  0.31%  0.44%  +0.12 \n 4  2023-11-19  0.29%  0.31%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-10-10  0.23%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0031.html", "ref_desc": "RUSTSEC-2021-0031: nano_arena: split_at allows obtaining multiple mutable references to the same data \u203a RustSec Advisory DatabaseExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
