{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-23351", "Description": "The package github.com/pires/go-proxyproto before 0.5.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via the parseVersion1() function. The reader in this package is a default bufio.Reader wrapping a net.Conn. It will read from the connection until it finds a newline. Since no limits are implemented in the code, a deliberately malformed V1 header could be used to exhaust memory in a server process using this code - and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a stream starting with PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a newline) until the target stops acknowledging. The risk here is small, because only trusted sources should be allowed to send proxy protocol headers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23351", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGo-proxyproto Project\u00bbGo-proxyprotoVersions  before (<) 0.5.0cpe:2.3:a:go-proxyproto_project:go-proxyproto:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-08  0.17%  0.15%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.17%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/commit/7f48261db810703d173f27f3309a808cc2b49b8b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #71 from isedev/feature/issue-69-tests \u00b7 pires/go-proxyproto@7f48261 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/issues/69", "ref_desc": "parseVersion1() is not secure \u00b7 Issue #69 \u00b7 pires/go-proxyproto \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/pull/71", "ref_desc": "tests and fixes for issue #69 by isedev \u00b7 Pull Request #71 \u00b7 pires/go-proxyproto \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C36IBVOZXRTWM7MGTRUTOM56P5RR74VU/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: golang-github-pires-proxyproto-0.5.0-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMPIRESGOPROXYPROTO-1081577", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service (DoS) in github.com/pires/go-proxyproto | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4BNVGJMVI3ZTZ675EFPUHPGXCKCGSX46/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: golang-github-pires-proxyproto-0.5.0-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
