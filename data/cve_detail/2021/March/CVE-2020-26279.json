{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26279", "Description": "go-ipfs is an open-source golang implementation of IPFS which is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. In go-ipfs before version 0.8.0-rc1, it is possible for path traversal to occur with DAGs containing relative paths during retrieval. This can cause files to be overwritten, or written to incorrect output directories. The issue can only occur when a get is done on an affected DAG. This is fixed in version 0.8.0-rc1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26279", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nProtocol\u00bbGo-ipfsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.7.0cpe:2.3:a:protocol:go-ipfs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/security/advisories/GHSA-27pv-q55r-222g", "ref_desc": "Path traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ipfs/go-ipfs \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/whyrusleeping/tar-utils/commit/20a61371de5b51380bbdb0c7935b30b0625ac227", "ref_desc": "more closely match default tar errors (GNU + BSD binaries) \u00b7 whyrusleeping/tar-utils@20a6137 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mDH3suqtu1ETZMq3d8kOyF0brmE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/commit/b7ddba7fe47dee5b1760b8ffe897908417e577b2", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #7812 from ipfs/chore/update-deps \u00b7 ipfs/go-ipfs@b7ddba7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
