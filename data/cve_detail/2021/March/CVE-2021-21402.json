{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21402", "Description": "Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System. In Jellyfin before version 10.7.1, with certain endpoints, well crafted requests will allow arbitrary file read from a Jellyfin server's file system. This issue is more prevalent when Windows is used as the host OS. Servers that are exposed to the public Internet are potentially at risk. This is fixed in version 10.7.1. As a workaround, users may be able to restrict some access by enforcing strict security permissions on their filesystem, however, it is recommended to update as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21402", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nJellyfin\u00bbJellyfinVersions  before (<) 10.7.1cpe:2.3:a:jellyfin:jellyfin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "77.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  22.21%  77.16%  +54.95 \n 2  2024-12-08  25.34%  22.21%  -3.13 \n 3  2024-11-20  26.52%  25.34%  -1.18 \n 4  2024-11-04  23.46%  26.52%  +3.07 \n 5  2024-09-30  22.69%  23.46%  +0.77 \n 6  2024-09-12  24.19%  22.69%  -1.50 \n 7  2024-08-26  27.11%  24.19%  -2.92 \n 8  2024-07-26  26.31%  27.11%  +0.80 \n 9  2024-06-24  24.50%  26.31%  +1.81 \n 10  2024-06-09  22.23%  24.50%  +2.27 \n 11  2024-05-24  21.66%  22.23%  +0.57 \n 12  2024-05-09  20.51%  21.66%  +1.15 \n 13  2024-04-25  15.59%  20.51%  +4.92 \n 14  2023-11-24  18.03%  15.59%  -2.44 \n 15  2023-11-11  21.58%  18.03%  -3.55 \n 16  2023-10-16  19.38%  21.58%  +2.20 \n 17  2023-09-05  23.51%  19.38%  -4.14 \n 18  2023-08-09  25.76%  23.51%  -2.25 \n 19  2023-07-13  26.53%  25.76%  -0.77 \n 20  2023-06-27  26.41%  26.53%  +0.12 \n 21  2023-04-19  30.69%  26.41%  -4.28 \n 22  2023-04-06  37.95%  30.69%  -7.25 \n 23  2023-03-08  35.45%  37.95%  +2.50 \n 24  2023-03-07  58.04%  35.45%  -22.58 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/commit/0183ef8e89195f420c48d2600bc0b72f6d3a7fd7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wg4c-c9g9-rxhx \u00b7 jellyfin/jellyfin@0183ef8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/releases/tag/v10.7.1", "ref_desc": "Release Release 10.7.1 \u00b7 jellyfin/jellyfin \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/security/advisories/GHSA-wg4c-c9g9-rxhx", "ref_desc": "Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Access \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jellyfin/jellyfin \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
