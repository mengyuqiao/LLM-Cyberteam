{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21334", "Description": "In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd's CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21334", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbContainerdVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.4.4cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbContainerdVersions  before (<) 1.3.10cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.12%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-33", "ref_desc": "containerd: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202105-33) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dVT9YHqxsESELbk65lR_TWQY58M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QIBPKSX5IOWPM3ZPFB3JVLXWDHSZTTWT/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: golang-github-containerd-cri-1.19.0-3.20210307gitaa2d5a9.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KUE2Z2ZUWBHRU36ZGBD2YSJCYB6ELPXE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: containerd-1.4.4-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.3.10", "ref_desc": "Release containerd 1.3.10 \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.4", "ref_desc": "Release containerd 1.4.4 \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/05f951a3781f4f2c1911b05e61c160e9c30eaa8e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-6g2q-w5j3-fwh4 \u00b7 containerd/containerd@05f951a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-6g2q-w5j3-fwh4", "ref_desc": "containerd CRI plugin: environment variables can leak between containers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VTXHA5JOWQRCCUZH7ZQBEYN6KZKJEYSD/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: golang-github-containerd-cri-1.19.0-3.20210307gitaa2d5a9.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
