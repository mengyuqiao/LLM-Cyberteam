{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21367", "Description": "Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21367", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nElementary\u00bbSwitchboard Bluetooth Plug\u00bbForElementary OsVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.5cpe:2.3:a:elementary:switchboard_bluetooth_plug:*:*:*:*:*:elementary_os:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-26  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-10-17  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-21  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.08%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/O7TCGM4B45VLUJDCE5PHFYA5KBNHD4RA/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: switchboard-plug-bluetooth-2.3.5-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AV7WKO5SZHTF3QEMX4WZ576HRECIG6VQ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: switchboard-plug-bluetooth-2.3.5-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/commit/86500e645a907538abafe5225b67cc12c03e7645", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5p3g-j69g-w2mq \u00b7 elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth@86500e6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/releases/tag/2.3.5", "ref_desc": "Release switchboard-plug-bluetooth 2.3.5 Released \u00b7 elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/security/advisories/GHSA-5p3g-j69g-w2mq", "ref_desc": "Incorrect Authorization in switchboard-plug-bluetooth \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SWUPPVFG76PXQA3AHSGKYPRMVZ5AYHZI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: switchboard-plug-bluetooth-2.3.5-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
