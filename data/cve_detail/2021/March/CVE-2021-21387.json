{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21387", "Description": "Wrongthink peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted messenger with PeerJS and Axolotl ratchet. In wrongthink from version 2.0.0 and before 2.3.0 there was a set of vulnerabilities causing inadequate encryption strength. Part of the secret identity key was disclosed by the fingerprint used for connection. Additionally, the safety number was improperly calculated. It was computed using part of one of the public identity keys instead of being derived from both public identity keys. This caused issues in computing safety numbers which would potentially be exploitable in the real world. Additionally there was inadequate encryption strength due to use of 1024-bit DSA keys. These issues are all fixed in version 2.3.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21387", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWrongthink\u00bbWrongthinkVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:wrongthink:wrongthink:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-03  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-24  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-358 Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/358/Improperly-Implemented-Security-Check-for-Standard.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parabirb/wrongthink/security/advisories/GHSA-5jxh-6378-rg7v", "ref_desc": "Partial secret key disclosure, improper safety number calculation, & inadequate encryption strength \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parabirb/wrongthink \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
