{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22114", "Description": "Addresses partial fix in CVE-2018-1263. Spring-integration-zip, versions prior to 1.0.4, exposes an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22114", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbSpring Integration ZipVersions  before (<) 1.0.4cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_integration_zip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-15  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-06  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22114", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-22114: Zip-slip mitigation bypass in Spring Integration Zip extension | Security | VMware TanzuVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
