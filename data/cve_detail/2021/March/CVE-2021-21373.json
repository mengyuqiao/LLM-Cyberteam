{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21373", "Description": "Nimble is a package manager for the Nim programming language. In Nim release versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, \"nimble refresh\" fetches a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS by default. In case of error it falls back to a non-TLS URL http://irclogs.nim-lang.org/packages.json. An attacker able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21373", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNim-lang\u00bbNIMVersions  before (<) 1.2.10cpe:2.3:a:nim-lang:nim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNim-lang\u00bbNIMVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.4.4cpe:2.3:a:nim-lang:nim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-31  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2023-09-22  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.08%  -2.43 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-348 Use of Less Trusted Source", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/348/Use-of-Less-Trusted-Source.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/blob/master/changelog.markdown#0130", "ref_desc": "nimble/changelog.markdown at master \u00b7 nim-lang/nimble \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5qxGhnL053Jzekhs3-hVGFXrS-Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nim-lang/security/security/advisories/GHSA-8w52-r35x-rgp8", "ref_desc": "Nimble falls back to insecure http url when fetching packages \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nim-lang/security \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://consensys.net/diligence/vulnerabilities/nim-insecure-ssl-tls-defaults-remote-code-execution/", "ref_desc": "Nim - Insecure SSL/TLS Defaults, MitM, and nimble shell command injection | ConsenSys DiligenceExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KrhtDpmcG7OUbT9vnmEmJTbD2_Q.html"}]}
