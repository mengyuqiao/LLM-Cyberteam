{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35492", "Description": "A flaw was found in cairo's image-compositor.c in all versions prior to 1.17.4. This flaw allows an attacker who can provide a crafted input file to cairo's image-compositor (for example, by convincing a user to open a file in an application using cairo, or if an application uses cairo on untrusted input) to cause a stack buffer overflow -> out-of-bounds WRITE. The highest impact from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35492", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nCairographics\u00bbCairoVersions  before (<) 1.17.4cpe:2.3:a:cairographics:cairo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-02  0.18%  0.12%  -0.06 \n 2  2023-10-23  0.10%  0.18%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-09-27  0.12%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-09-14  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-05-12  0.07%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-04  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 \n 8  2023-02-13  0.95%  0.89%  -0.07 \n 9  2023-02-03  0.89%  0.95%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-21", "ref_desc": "Cairo: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (GLSA 202305-21) \u2014 Gentoo security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1898396", "ref_desc": "1898396 \u2013 (CVE-2020-35492) CVE-2020-35492 cairo: libreoffice slideshow aborts with stack smashing in cairo's composite_boxesIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
