{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21412", "Description": "Potential for arbitrary code execution in npm package @thi.ng/egf `#gpg`-tagged property values (only if `decrypt: true` option is enabled). PR with patch has been submitted and will has been released as of v0.4.0 By default the EGF parse functions do NOT attempt to decrypt values (since GPG only available in non-browser env). However, if GPG encrypted values are used/required: 1. Perform a regex search for `#gpg`-tagged values in the EGF source file/string and check for backtick (\\`) chars in the encrypted value string 2. Replace/remove them or skip parsing if present.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21412", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\n@thi.ng/egf Project\u00bb@thi.ng/egf\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.4.0cpe:2.3:a:\\@thi.ng\\/egf_project:\\@thi.ng\\/egf:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-09-26  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.16%  -2.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/security/advisories/GHSA-rj44-gpjc-29r7", "ref_desc": "[thi.ng/egf] Potential arbitrary code execution of `#gpg`-tagged property values \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 thi-ng/umbrella \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thi.ng/egf", "ref_desc": "@thi.ng/egf - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/develop/packages/egf/CHANGELOG.md#040-2021-03-27", "ref_desc": "umbrella/CHANGELOG.md at develop \u00b7 thi-ng/umbrella \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/88f61656e5f5cfba960013b8133186389efaf243", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-rj44-gpjc-29r7 \u00b7 thi-ng/umbrella@88f6165 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
