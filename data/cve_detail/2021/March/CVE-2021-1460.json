{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1460", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco IOx Application Framework of Cisco 809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs), Cisco 829 Industrial ISRs, Cisco CGR 1000 Compute Module, and Cisco IC3000 Industrial Compute Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1460", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIOSVersions  before (<) 15.9\\(3\\)m3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:ios:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb809 Industrial Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb829 Industrial Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbIc3000 Industrial Compute Gateway FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.3.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ic3000_industrial_compute_gateway_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbIc3000 Industrial Compute Gateway\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbCgr1000 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.12.0.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:cgr1000_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCgr1000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-08  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-10-29  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iox-dos-4Fgcjh6", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOx Application Framework Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
