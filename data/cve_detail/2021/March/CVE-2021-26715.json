{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-26715", "Description": "The OpenID Connect server implementation for MITREid Connect through 1.3.3 contains a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The vulnerability arises due to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration request. An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable server to any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might, for example, have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26715", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nMitreid\u00bbConnectVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.3cpe:2.3:a:mitreid:connect:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.48%  +0.26 \n 2  2024-07-28  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-02-15  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 4  2024-01-04  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-12-09  0.15%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-10-30  0.15%  0.15%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://portswigger.net/research/hidden-oauth-attack-vectors", "ref_desc": "Hidden OAuth attack vectors | PortSwigger ResearchExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xhu5bbLGiY0kHirXcEmDb0DZJI8.html"}]}
