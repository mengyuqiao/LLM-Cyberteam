{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28133", "Description": "Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28133", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nZoom\u00bbZoomVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.5.4cpe:2.3:a:zoom:zoom:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.26%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-19  0.18%  0.26%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-12-02  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-23  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-27  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.12%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/syss-2020-044-sicherheitsproblem-in-screen-sharing-funktionalitaet-von-zoom-cve-2021-28133", "ref_desc": "SYSS-2020-044: Sicherheitsproblem in Screen Sharing-Funktionalit\u00e4t von ZoomThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/new-zoom-screen-sharing-bug-lets-other.html", "ref_desc": "New Zoom Screen-Sharing Bug Lets Other Users Access Restricted AppsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2020-044.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/161897/Zoom-5.4.3-54779.1115-5.5.4-13142.0301-Information-Disclosure.html", "ref_desc": "Zoom 5.4.3 (54779.1115) / 5.5.4 (13142.0301) Information Disclosure \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Mar/48", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2020-044]: Zoom - Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere (CWE-668) (CVE-2021-28133)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://zoom.us/trust/security/security-bulletin", "ref_desc": "Security BulletinVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SonmmgQlLzg", "ref_desc": "Zoom Unintended Screen Sharing Issue (CVE-2021-28133) - YouTubeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
