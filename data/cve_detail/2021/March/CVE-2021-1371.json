{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1371", "Description": "A vulnerability in the role-based access control of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with read-only privileges to obtain administrative privileges by using the console port when the device is in the default SD-WAN configuration. This vulnerability occurs because the default configuration is applied for console authentication and authorization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the console port and authenticating as a read-only user. A successful exploit could allow a user with read-only permissions to access administrative privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1371", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe Sd-wan\u00bbVersion:17.2.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe_sd-wan:17.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCloud Services Router 1000v\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1100 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1101 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1109 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1111x Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb111x Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1120 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb1160 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4221 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4321 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4331 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4351 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4431 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4451 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bb4461 Integrated Services Router\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 1000\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-esc-rSNVvTf9", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software Console Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
