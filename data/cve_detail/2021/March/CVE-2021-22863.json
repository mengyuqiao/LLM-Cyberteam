{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22863", "Description": "An improper access control vulnerability was identified in the GitHub Enterprise Server GraphQL API that allowed authenticated users of the instance to modify the maintainer collaboration permission of a pull request without proper authorization. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker would be able to gain access to head branches of pull requests opened on repositories of which they are a maintainer. Forking is disabled by default for organization owned private repositories and would prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server since 2.12.22 and was fixed in versions 2.20.24, 2.21.15, 2.22.7 and 3.0.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22863", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbGithub\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.21.0andbefore (<) 2.21.15cpe:2.3:a:github:github:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbGithub\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.22.0andbefore (<) 2.22.7cpe:2.3:a:github:github:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbGithub\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 2.12.22andbefore (<) 2.20.24cpe:2.3:a:github:github:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbGithubVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:github:github:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-08  0.08%  0.17%  +0.09 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/admin/release-notes#2.22.7", "ref_desc": "Release notes - GitHub DocsRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/a4ofaJx-I2Mv00paIzvW73hQ6n0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release notes - GitHub DocsRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/E3d1Hkses98pKV7UYRiziLHsz2o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.21/admin/release-notes#2.21.15", "ref_desc": "Release notes - GitHub DocsRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Rxzr69TuIX1YHSj62IPwSEw363g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.20/admin/release-notes#2.20.24", "ref_desc": "Release notes - GitHub DocsRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wq49gmwpxu6bETvZH0IRT6MnG60.html"}]}
