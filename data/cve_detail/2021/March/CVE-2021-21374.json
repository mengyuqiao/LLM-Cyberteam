{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21374", "Description": "Nimble is a package manager for the Nim programming language. In Nim release versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, \"nimble refresh\" fetches a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS without full verification of the SSL/TLS certificate due to the default setting of httpClient. An attacker able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21374", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNim-lang\u00bbNIMVersions  before (<) 1.2.10cpe:2.3:a:nim-lang:nim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNim-lang\u00bbNIMVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 1.4.4cpe:2.3:a:nim-lang:nim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.21%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-12-10  0.18%  0.17%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-10-31  0.19%  0.18%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-04-22  0.20%  0.19%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.20%  -2.31 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-348 Use of Less Trusted Source", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/348/Use-of-Less-Trusted-Source.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-349 Acceptance of Extraneous Untrusted Data With Trusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/349/Acceptance-of-Extraneous-Untrusted-Data-With-Trusted-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-599 Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/599/Missing-Validation-of-OpenSSL-Certificate.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/blob/master/changelog.markdown#0130", "ref_desc": "nimble/changelog.markdown at master \u00b7 nim-lang/nimble \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5qxGhnL053Jzekhs3-hVGFXrS-Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nim-lang/security/security/advisories/GHSA-c2wm-v66h-xhxx", "ref_desc": "Nimble fails to validate certificates due to insecure httpClient defaults \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nim-lang/security \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://consensys.net/diligence/vulnerabilities/nim-insecure-ssl-tls-defaults-remote-code-execution/", "ref_desc": "Nim - Insecure SSL/TLS Defaults, MitM, and nimble shell command injection | ConsenSys DiligenceExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KrhtDpmcG7OUbT9vnmEmJTbD2_Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/16940", "ref_desc": "basic cleanups regarding SSL handling by Araq \u00b7 Pull Request #16940 \u00b7 nim-lang/Nim \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
