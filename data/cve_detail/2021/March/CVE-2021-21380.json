{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21380", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions of XWiki Platform (and only those with the Ratings API installed), the Rating Script Service expose an API to perform SQL requests without escaping the from and where search arguments. This might lead to an SQL script injection quite easily for any user having Script rights on XWiki. The problem has been patched in XWiki 12.9RC1. The only workaround besides upgrading XWiki would be to uninstall the Ratings API in XWiki from the Extension Manager.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21380", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 6.4.1andup to, including, (<=) 12.8cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:6.4cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:6.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:6.4UpdateMilestone3cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:6.4:milestone3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:6.4UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:6.4:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17662", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-17662] Rating Script Service expose XWiki to SQL injection - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-79rg-7mv3-jrr5", "ref_desc": "Rating Script Service expose XWiki to SQL injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
