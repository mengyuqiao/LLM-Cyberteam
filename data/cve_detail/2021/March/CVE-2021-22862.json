{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22862", "Description": "An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed an authenticated user with the ability to fork a repository to disclose Actions secrets for the parent repository of the fork. This vulnerability existed due to a flaw that allowed the base reference of a pull request to be updated to point to an arbitrary SHA or another pull request outside of the fork repository. By establishing this incorrect reference in a PR, the restrictions that limit the Actions secrets sent a workflow from forks could be bypassed. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.0.0, 3.0.0.rc2, and 3.0.0.rc1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22862", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbGithub\u00bbVersion:3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:github:github:3.0.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbGithub\u00bbVersion:3.0.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:github:github:3.0.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbGithub\u00bbVersion:3.0.0UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:github:github:3.0.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release notes - GitHub DocsRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/E3d1Hkses98pKV7UYRiziLHsz2o.html"}]}
