{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20206", "Description": "An improper limitation of path name flaw was found in containernetworking/cni in versions before 0.8.1. When specifying the plugin to load in the 'type' field in the network configuration, it is possible to use special elements such as \"../\" separators to reference binaries elsewhere on the system. This flaw allows an attacker to execute other existing binaries other than the cni plugins/types, such as 'reboot'. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20206", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbContainer Network InterfaceVersions  before (<) 0.8.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:container_network_interface:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-08-13  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-10  0.19%  0.12%  -0.08 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.12%  0.19%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-06-30  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-05-20  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMCONTAINERNETWORKINGCNIPKGINVOKE-1070549", "ref_desc": "Directory Traversal in github.com/containernetworking/cni/pkg/invoke | SnykThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1919391", "ref_desc": "1919391 \u2013 (CVE-2021-20206) CVE-2021-20206 containernetworking-cni: Arbitrary path injection via type field in CNI configurationIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
