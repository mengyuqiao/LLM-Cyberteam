{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-3446", "Description": "A flaw was found in libtpms in versions before 0.8.2. The commonly used integration of libtpms with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the initial IV to the caller, thus weakening the subsequent encryption and decryption steps. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3446", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbEnterprise Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0    Advanced VirtualizationEditioncpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8.0:*:*:*:advanced_virtualization:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLibtpms Project\u00bbLibtpmsVersions  before (<) 0.8.2cpe:2.3:a:libtpms_project:libtpms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1939664", "ref_desc": "1939664 \u2013 (CVE-2021-3446) CVE-2021-3446 libtpms: return of wrong initialization vector when certain symmetric ciphers are usedIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
