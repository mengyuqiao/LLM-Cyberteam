{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24033", "Description": "react-dev-utils prior to v11.0.4 exposes a function, getProcessForPort, where an input argument is concatenated into a command string to be executed. This function is typically used from react-scripts (in Create React App projects), where the usage is safe. Only when this function is manually invoked with user-provided values (ie: by custom code) is there the potential for command injection. If you're consuming it from react-scripts then this issue does not affect you.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24033", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbReact-dev-utilsVersions  before (<) 11.0.4cpe:2.3:a:facebook:react-dev-utils:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.80%  +0.63 \n 2  2024-08-29  0.24%  0.17%  -0.07 \n 3  2024-03-26  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-02-26  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-10-13  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.06%  0.10%  -1.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/10644", "ref_desc": "Security Fix for Command Injection - huntr.dev by huntr-helper \u00b7 Pull Request #10644 \u00b7 facebook/create-react-app \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2021-24033", "ref_desc": "FacebookVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
