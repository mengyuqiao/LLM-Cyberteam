{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1452", "Description": "A vulnerability in the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst IE3200, IE3300, and IE3400 Rugged Series Switches, Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series Switches, and Cisco Embedded Services 3300 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker to execute unsigned code at system boot time. This vulnerability is due to incorrect validations of specific function arguments passed to a boot script when specific ROMMON variables are set. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting malicious values for a specific ROMMON variable. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute unsigned code and bypass the image verification check during the secure boot process of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have unauthenticated, physical access to the device or obtain privileged access to the root shell on the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1452", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe Rom MonitorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe_rom_monitor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst Ie3200 Rugged Switch\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst Ie3300 Rugged Switch\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst Ie3400 Heavy Duty Switch\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbCatalyst Ie3400 Rugged Switch\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbEss 3300\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-22  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-12-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-25  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-romvar-cmd-inj-N56fYbrw", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE ROM Monitor Software for Cisco Industrial Switches OS Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
