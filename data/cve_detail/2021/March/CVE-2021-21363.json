{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21363", "Description": "swagger-codegen is an open-source project which contains a template-driven engine to generate documentation, API clients and server stubs in different languages by parsing your OpenAPI / Swagger definition. In swagger-codegen before version 2.4.19, on Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. This vulnerability is local privilege escalation because the contents of the `outputFolder` can be appended to by an attacker. As such, code written to this directory, when executed can be attacker controlled. For more details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory. This vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.19. Note this is a distinct vulnerability from CVE-2021-21364.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21363", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSmartbear\u00bbSwagger-codegenVersions  before (<) 2.4.19cpe:2.3:a:smartbear:swagger-codegen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 \n 2  2023-02-22  1.40%  0.89%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-378 Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/378/Creation-of-Temporary-File-With-Insecure-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-379 Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/379/Creation-of-Temporary-File-in-Directory-with-Insecure-Permis.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/security/advisories/GHSA-pc22-3g76-gm6j", "ref_desc": "Generator Web Application: Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability via System Temp Directory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 swagger-api/swagger-codegen \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/commit/987ea7a30b463cc239580d6ad166c707ae942a89", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-pc22-3g76-gm6j \u00b7 swagger-api/swagger-codegen@987ea7a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
