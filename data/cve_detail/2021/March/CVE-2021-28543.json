{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28543", "Description": "Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28543", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVarnish-cache\u00bbVarnish-modulesVersions  before (<) 0.17.1cpe:2.3:a:varnish-cache:varnish-modules:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVarnish-cache\u00bbVarnish-modules KlarlackVersions  before (<) 0.17.1cpe:2.3:a:varnish-cache:varnish-modules_klarlack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.20%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-11-30  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-10-21  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.20%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OPFBRQUJNWHCB3GQHSSAPRLQU6Q6PY43/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: varnish-modules-0.17.1-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00006.html", "ref_desc": "VSV00006 varnish-modules Denial of Service \u2014 Varnish HTTP CacheVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
