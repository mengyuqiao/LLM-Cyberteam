{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21386", "Description": "APKLeaks is an open-source project for scanning APK file for URIs, endpoints & secrets. APKLeaks prior to v2.0.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via package name inside application manifest. An attacker could include arguments that allow unintended commands or code to be executed, allow sensitive data to be read or modified or could cause other unintended behavior through malicious package name. The problem is fixed in version v2.0.6-dev and above.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21386", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApkleaks Project\u00bbApkleaksVersions  before (<) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:apkleaks_project:apkleaks:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.79%  +0.47 \n 2  2024-12-09  0.33%  0.32%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-12-08  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-10-29  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-09  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.28%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dwisiswant0/apkleaks/security/advisories/GHSA-8434-v7xw-8m9x", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Decompiling Package Process \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dwisiswant0/apkleaks \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dwisiswant0/apkleaks/commit/a966e781499ff6fd4eea66876d7532301b13a382", "ref_desc": "Escapes decompiling arguments \u00b7 dwisiswant0/apkleaks@a966e78 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
