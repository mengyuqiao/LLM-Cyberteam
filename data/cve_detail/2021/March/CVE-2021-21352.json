{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21352", "Description": "Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. In TimeTracker before version 1.19.24.5415 tokens used in password reset feature in Time Tracker are based on system time and, therefore, are predictable. This opens a window for brute force attacks to guess user tokens and, once successful, change user passwords, including that of a system administrator. This vulnerability is pathced in version 1.19.24.5415 (started to use more secure tokens) with an additional improvement in 1.19.24.5416 (limited an available window for brute force token guessing).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21352", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAnuko\u00bbTime TrackerVersions  before (<) 1.19.24.5415cpe:2.3:a:anuko:time_tracker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.19%  -0.08 \n 2  2023-11-16  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-10-07  0.25%  0.25%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-11  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.24%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.anuko.com/time-tracker/index.htm", "ref_desc": "Time TrackerVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-Qwqry7YF5nw1sU0PmD_G_WCfuE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-43c9-rx4h-4gqq", "ref_desc": "Predictable tokens used for password resets in versions prior to 1.19.24.5415 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anuko/timetracker \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/40f3d9345adc20e6f28eb9f59e2489aff87fecf5", "ref_desc": "Fixed a critical security vulnerability with password resets. \u00b7 anuko/timetracker@40f3d93 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
