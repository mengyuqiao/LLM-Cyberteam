{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21364", "Description": "swagger-codegen is an open-source project which contains a template-driven engine to generate documentation, API clients and server stubs in different languages by parsing your OpenAPI / Swagger definition. In swagger-codegen before version 2.4.19, on Unix-Like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between all local users. When files/directories are created, the default `umask` settings for the process are respected. As a result, by default, most processes/apis will create files/directories with the permissions `-rw-r--r--` and `drwxr-xr-x` respectively, unless an API that explicitly sets safe file permissions is used. Because this vulnerability impacts generated code, the generated code will remain vulnerable until fixed manually! This vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.19. Note this is a distinct vulnerability from CVE-2021-21363.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21364", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSmartbear\u00bbSwagger-codegenVersions  before (<) 2.4.19cpe:2.3:a:smartbear:swagger-codegen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 \n 2  2023-02-22  1.40%  0.89%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-378 Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/378/Creation-of-Temporary-File-With-Insecure-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/commit/35adbd552d5f99b3ff1e0e59da228becc85190f2", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hpv8-9rq5-hq7w \u00b7 swagger-api/swagger-codegen@35adbd5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/security/advisories/GHSA-hpv8-9rq5-hq7w", "ref_desc": "Generated Code Contains Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 swagger-api/swagger-codegen \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
