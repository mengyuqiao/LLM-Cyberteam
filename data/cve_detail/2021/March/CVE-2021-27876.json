{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-27876", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Veritas Backup Exec before 21.2. The communication between a client and an Agent requires successful authentication, which is typically completed over a secure TLS communication. However, due to a vulnerability in the SHA Authentication scheme, an attacker is able to gain unauthorized access and complete the authentication process. Subsequently, the client can execute data management protocol commands on the authenticated connection. By using crafted input parameters in one of these commands, an attacker can access an arbitrary file on the system using System privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27876", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nVeritas\u00bbBackup ExecVersions  before (<) 21.2cpe:2.3:a:veritas:backup_exec:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "87.77% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  74.31%  87.77%  +13.46 \n 2  2024-07-04  73.34%  74.31%  +0.98 \n 3  2024-03-18  72.73%  73.34%  +0.61 \n 4  2024-03-04  74.46%  72.73%  -1.73 \n 5  2024-01-22  74.68%  74.46%  -0.23 \n 6  2023-12-26  69.77%  74.68%  +4.91 \n 7  2023-12-11  72.58%  69.77%  -2.81 \n 8  2023-11-29  74.33%  72.58%  -1.75 \n 9  2023-10-20  77.91%  74.33%  -3.58 \n 10  2023-09-10  71.34%  77.91%  +6.57 \n 11  2023-08-14  69.49%  71.34%  +1.85 \n 12  2023-08-01  65.49%  69.49%  +4.00 \n 13  2023-07-08  67.10%  65.49%  -1.61 \n 14  2023-07-03  72.76%  67.10%  -5.66 \n 15  2023-06-05  77.61%  72.76%  -4.85 \n 16  2023-05-08  79.28%  77.61%  -1.67 \n 17  2023-04-11  80.51%  79.28%  -1.23 \n 18  2023-04-08  0.09%  80.51%  +80.43 \n 19  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS21-001#issue2", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory for Backup Exec version 21.2 | Veritas\u2122Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168506/Veritas-Backup-Exec-Agent-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Veritas Backup Exec Agent Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tbqAEev5JG0KF8QBMJeObMnpak0.html"}]}
