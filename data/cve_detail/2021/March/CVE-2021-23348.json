{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-23348", "Description": "This affects the package portprocesses before 1.0.5. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the killProcess function, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This is due to use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23348", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPortprocesses Project\u00bbPortprocesses\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.0.5cpe:2.3:a:portprocesses_project:portprocesses:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.01%  1.29%  -2.72 \n 2  2024-12-16  3.49%  4.01%  +0.52 \n 3  2024-11-12  2.88%  3.49%  +0.61 \n 4  2024-08-03  3.33%  2.88%  -0.46 \n 5  2024-07-02  3.33%  3.33%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-05-03  2.38%  3.33%  +0.95 \n 7  2024-04-17  2.26%  2.38%  +0.12 \n 8  2024-04-03  1.61%  2.26%  +0.66 \n 9  2024-03-19  1.14%  1.61%  +0.47 \n 10  2023-12-02  0.61%  1.14%  +0.53 \n 11  2023-10-24  0.72%  0.61%  -0.11 \n 12  2023-08-31  0.59%  0.72%  +0.13 \n 13  2023-08-02  0.51%  0.59%  +0.09 \n 14  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.51%  -0.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PORTPROCESSES-1078536", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary Command Injection in portprocesses | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rrainn/PortProcesses/security/advisories/GHSA-vm67-7vmg-66vm", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary Command Injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rrainn/PortProcesses \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rrainn/PortProcesses/commit/86811216c9b97b01b5722f879f8c88a7aa4214e1", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vm67-7vmg-66vm \u00b7 rrainn/PortProcesses@8681121 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rrainn/PortProcesses/blob/fffceb09aff7180afbd0bd172e820404b33c8299/index.js%23L23", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
