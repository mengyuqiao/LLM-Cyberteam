{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21322", "Description": "fastify-http-proxy is an npm package which is a fastify plugin for proxying your http requests to another server, with hooks. By crafting a specific URL, it is possible to escape the prefix of the proxied backend service. If the base url of the proxied server is `/pub/`, a user expect that accessing `/priv` on the target service would not be possible. In affected versions, it is possible. This is fixed in version 4.3.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21322", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nFastify-http-proxy Project\u00bbFastify-http-proxy\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.3.1cpe:2.3:a:fastify-http-proxy_project:fastify-http-proxy:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-07-20  0.22%  0.32%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-11-15  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-06  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-09-10  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.19%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-http-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-c4qr-gmr9-v23w", "ref_desc": "Prefix escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fastify/fastify-http-proxy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify-http-proxy", "ref_desc": "fastify-http-proxy - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-http-proxy/commit/02d9b43c770aa16bc44470edecfaeb7c17985016", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-c4qr-gmr9-v23w \u00b7 fastify/fastify-http-proxy@02d9b43 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
