{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21413", "Description": "isolated-vm is a library for nodejs which gives you access to v8's Isolate interface. Versions of isolated-vm before v4.0.0 have API pitfalls which may make it easy for implementers to expose supposed secure isolates to the permissions of the main nodejs isolate. Reference objects allow access to the underlying reference's full prototype chain. In an environment where the implementer has exposed a Reference instance to an attacker they would be able to use it to acquire a Reference to the nodejs context's Function object. Similar application-specific attacks could be possible by modifying the local prototype of other API objects. Access to NativeModule objects could allow an attacker to load and run native code from anywhere on the filesystem. If combined with, for example, a file upload API this would allow for arbitrary code execution. This is addressed in v4.0.0 through a series of related changes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21413", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIsolated-vm Project\u00bbIsolated-vm\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:a:isolated-vm_project:isolated-vm:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.15%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-03-05  0.20%  0.17%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-12-14  0.16%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-11-05  0.17%  0.16%  0.00 \n 5  2023-10-09  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.56%  0.14%  -1.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-913 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/913/Improper-Control-of-Dynamically-Managed-Code-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v400", "ref_desc": "isolated-vm/CHANGELOG.md at main \u00b7 laverdet/isolated-vm \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/2646e6c1558bac66285daeab54c7d490ed332b15", "ref_desc": "Don't invoke accessors or proxies via Reference functions \u00b7 laverdet/isolated-vm@2646e6c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/security/advisories/GHSA-mmhj-4w6j-76h7", "ref_desc": "Misuse of `Reference` and other transferable APIs may lead to access to nodejs isolate \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 laverdet/isolated-vm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/27151bfecc260e96714443613880e3b2e6596704", "ref_desc": "Disallow NativeModule creation unless main isolate \u00b7 laverdet/isolated-vm@27151bf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
