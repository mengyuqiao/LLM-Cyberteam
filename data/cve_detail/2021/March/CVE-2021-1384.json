{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1384", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco IOx application hosting environment of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject commands into the underlying operating system as the root user. This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of fields in the application packages loaded onto IOx. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a crafted application .tar file and loading it onto the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform command injection into the underlying operating system as the root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1384", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  from including (>=) 16.9.0andbefore (<) 16.9.7cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  from including (>=) 17.4.0andbefore (<) 17.4.2cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  before (<) 16.6.9cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos XeVersions  from including (>=) 17.3.2andbefore (<) 17.3.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:17.5.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:17.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.50%  +0.26 \n 2  2024-12-09  0.26%  0.24%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-11-21  0.22%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-07-27  0.25%  0.22%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.25%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-h332-fj6p-2232", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOx - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CVE-2021-1384) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 orangecertcc/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iox-cmdinj-RkSURGHG", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
