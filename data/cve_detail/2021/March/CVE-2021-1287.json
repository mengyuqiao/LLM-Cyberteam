{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1287", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N VPN Routers and Cisco RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1287", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv132w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.1.15cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv132w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv132w\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv134w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.1.21cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv134w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv134w\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-03  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-06-10  0.16%  0.22%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.16%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-132w134w-overflow-Pptt4H2p", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV132W and RV134W Routers Management Interface Remote Command Execution and Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
