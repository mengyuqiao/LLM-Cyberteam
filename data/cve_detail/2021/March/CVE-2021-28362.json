{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28362", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Contiki through 3.0. When sending an ICMPv6 error message because of invalid extension header options in an incoming IPv6 packet, there is an attempt to remove the RPL extension headers. Because the packet length and the extension header length are unchecked (with respect to the available data) at this stage, and these variables are susceptible to integer underflow, it is possible to construct an invalid extension header that will cause memory corruption issues and lead to a Denial-of-Service condition. This is related to rpl-ext-header.c.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28362", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-os\u00bbContikiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.0cpe:2.3:o:contiki-os:contiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-08  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-10-29  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815128", "ref_desc": "VU#815128 - Embedded TCP/IP stacks have memory corruption vulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-FUlxT2jz69AbCp7LSKOixlsgNQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 contiki-os/contiki \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
