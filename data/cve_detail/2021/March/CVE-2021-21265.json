{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21265", "Description": "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October before version 1.1.2, when running on poorly configured servers (i.e. the server routes any request, regardless of the HOST header to an October CMS instance) the potential exists for Host Header Poisoning attacks to succeed. This has been addressed in version 1.1.2 by adding a feature to allow a set of trusted hosts to be specified in the application. As a workaround one may set the configuration setting cms.linkPolicy to force.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21265", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  before (<) 1.1.2cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-11-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-15  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-19  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-644 Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/644/Improper-Neutralization-of-HTTP-Headers-for-Scripting-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/f638d3f78cfe91d7f6658820f9d5e424306a3db0", "ref_desc": "Add app.trustedHosts config and force host checks on password reset (\u2026 \u00b7 octobercms/october@f638d3f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-xhfx-hgmf-v6vp", "ref_desc": "Potential Host Header Poisoning on misconfigured servers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/f86fcbcd066d6f8b939e8fe897409d152b11c3c6", "ref_desc": "Add trusted hosts support to library (#549) \u00b7 octobercms/library@f86fcbc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
