{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20268", "Description": "An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the eBPF code verifier in the way a user running the eBPF script calls dev_map_init_map or sock_map_alloc. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20268", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux KernelVersions  before (<) 5.10.10cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210409-0006/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-20268 Linux Kernel Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/CACAyw99bEYWJCSGqfLiJ9Jp5YE1ZsZSiJxb4RFUTwbofipf0dA@mail.gmail.com/T/#m8929643e99bea9c18ed490a7bc2591145eac6444", "ref_desc": "[PATCH] bpf: Fix integer overflow in argument calculation for bpf_map_area_allocPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1923816", "ref_desc": "1923816 \u2013 (CVE-2021-20268) CVE-2021-20268 kernel: eBPF Improper Input ValidationIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
