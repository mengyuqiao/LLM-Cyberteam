{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22864", "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to override environment variables leading to code execution on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.0.3 and was fixed in 3.0.3, 2.22.9, and 2.21.17. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22864", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbEnterprise ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2.21.0andbefore (<) 2.21.17cpe:2.3:a:github:enterprise_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbEnterprise ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2.22.0andbefore (<) 2.22.9cpe:2.3:a:github:enterprise_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGithub\u00bbEnterprise ServerVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.3cpe:2.3:a:github:enterprise_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-07  0.66%  0.93%  +0.27 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.87%  0.66%  -0.21 \n 3  2023-09-05  0.84%  0.87%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  4.57%  0.84%  -3.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.3", "ref_desc": "Release notes - GitHub DocsRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/admin/release-notes#2.22.9", "ref_desc": "Release notes - GitHub DocsRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.21/admin/release-notes#2.21.17", "ref_desc": "Release notes - GitHub DocsRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
