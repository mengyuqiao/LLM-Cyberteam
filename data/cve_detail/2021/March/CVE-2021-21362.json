{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21362", "Description": "MinIO is an open-source high performance object storage service and it is API compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z it is possible to bypass a readOnly policy by creating a temporary 'mc share upload' URL. Everyone is impacted who uses MinIO multi-users. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z. As a workaround, one can disable uploads with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` as mentioned in the S3 API RESTObjectPOST docs by using a proxy in front of MinIO.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21362", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinioVersions  before (<) 2021-03-04t00-53-13zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-05-31  0.08%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z", "ref_desc": "Release Security Bugfix Release \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/11682", "ref_desc": "fix: missing user policy enforcement in PostPolicyHandler by harshavardhana \u00b7 Pull Request #11682 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-hq5j-6r98-9m8v", "ref_desc": "Bypassing readOnly policy by creating a temporary 'mc share upload' URL \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/039f59b552319fcc2f83631bb421a7d4b82bc482", "ref_desc": "fix: missing user policy enforcement in PostPolicyHandler (#11682) \u00b7 minio/minio@039f59b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
