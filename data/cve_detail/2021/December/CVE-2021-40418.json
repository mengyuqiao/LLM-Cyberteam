{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40418", "Description": "When parsing a file that is submitted to the DPDecoder service as a job, the R3D SDK will mistakenly skip over the assignment of a property containing an object referring to a UUID that was parsed from a frame within the video container. Upon destruction of the object that owns it, the uninitialized member will be dereferenced and then destroyed using the object\u2019s virtual destructor. Due to the object property being uninitialized, this can result in dereferencing an arbitrary pointer for the object\u2019s virtual method table, which can result in code execution under the context of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40418", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBlackmagicdesign\u00bbDavinci Resolve\u00bbVersion:17.3.1.0005cpe:2.3:a:blackmagicdesign:davinci_resolve:17.3.1.0005:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.65% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.57%  0.65%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-11-27  0.54%  0.57%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-11-13  0.39%  0.54%  +0.15 \n 4  2024-10-02  0.42%  0.39%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-09-06  0.40%  0.42%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-07-28  0.34%  0.40%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-07-15  0.33%  0.34%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-06-04  0.31%  0.33%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.09%  0.31%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-457 Use of Uninitialized Variable", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/457/Use-of-Uninitialized-Variable.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/908/Use-of-Uninitialized-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1427", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2021-1427 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
