{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44680", "Description": "An issue (4 of 6) was discovered in Veritas Enterprise Vault through 14.1.2. On start-up, the Enterprise Vault application starts several services that listen on random .NET Remoting TCP ports for possible commands from client applications. These TCP services can be exploited due to deserialization behavior that is inherent to the .NET Remoting service. A malicious attacker can exploit both TCP remoting services and local IPC services on the Enterprise Vault Server. This vulnerability is mitigated by properly configuring the servers and firewall as described in the vendor's security alert for this vulnerability (VTS21-003, ZDI-CAN-14075).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44680", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVeritas\u00bbEnterprise VaultVersions  up to, including, (<=) 14.1.2cpe:2.3:a:veritas:enterprise_vault:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.65%  1.13%  +0.47 \n 2  2024-08-21  0.76%  0.65%  -0.11 \n 3  2024-07-12  0.68%  0.76%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-05-07  0.57%  0.68%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-02-28  0.61%  0.57%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-11-05  0.43%  0.61%  +0.18 \n 7  2023-06-29  0.43%  0.43%  0.00 \n 8  2023-05-19  0.26%  0.43%  +0.17 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.26%  -0.62 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS21-003", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Veritas Enterprise Vault | Veritas\u2122Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/09oObw2ZBNEvLwvmy_S-hWe8o14.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-1590/", "ref_desc": "ZDI-21-1590 | Zero Day InitiativeThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
