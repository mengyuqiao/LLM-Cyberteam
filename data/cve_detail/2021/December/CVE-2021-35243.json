{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-35243", "Description": "The HTTP PUT and DELETE methods were enabled in the Web Help Desk web server (12.7.7 and earlier), allowing users to execute dangerous HTTP requests. The HTTP PUT method is normally used to upload data that is saved on the server with a user-supplied URL. While the DELETE method requests that the origin server removes the association between the target resource and its current functionality. Improper use of these methods may lead to a loss of integrity.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35243", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSolarwinds\u00bbWeb Help DeskVersions  up to, including, (<=) 12.7.7cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:web_help_desk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-09-06  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-16  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-05  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-749 Exposed Dangerous Method or Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/749/Exposed-Dangerous-Method-or-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35243", "ref_desc": "SolarWinds Trust Center Security Advisories | CVE-2021-35243Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Web-Help-Desk-12-7-7-Hotfix-1-Release-Notes?language=en_US", "ref_desc": "Web Help Desk 12.7.7 Hotfix 1 Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LDko89y1zzBsuxDc9aMZ1LP4geM.html"}]}
