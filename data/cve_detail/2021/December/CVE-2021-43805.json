{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43805", "Description": "Solidus is a free, open-source ecommerce platform built on Rails. Versions of Solidus prior to 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have a denial of service vulnerability that could be exploited during a guest checkout. The regular expression used to validate a guest order's email was subject to exponential backtracking through a fragment like `a.a.` Versions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use a different regular expression. The maintainers added a check for email addresses that are no longer valid that will print information about any affected orders that exist. If a prompt upgrade is not an option, a workaround is available. It is possible to edit the file `config/application.rb` manually (with code provided by the maintainers in the GitHub Security Advisory) to check email validity.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43805", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNebulab\u00bbSolidusVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.0andbefore (<) 3.1.4cpe:2.3:a:nebulab:solidus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNebulab\u00bbSolidusVersions  before (<) 2.11.13cpe:2.3:a:nebulab:solidus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNebulab\u00bbSolidusVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nebulab:solidus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-08-22  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-30  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-05-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/9867153e01e3c3b898cdbcedd7b43375ea922401", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qxmr-qxh6-2cc9 \u00b7 solidusio/solidus@9867153 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/security/advisories/GHSA-qxmr-qxh6-2cc9", "ref_desc": "ReDos vulnerability on guest checkout email validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 solidusio/solidus \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
