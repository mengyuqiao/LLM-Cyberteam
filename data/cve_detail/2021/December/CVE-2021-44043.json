{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44043", "Description": "An issue was discovered in UiPath App Studio 21.4.4. There is a persistent XSS vulnerability in the file-upload functionality for uploading icons when attempting to create new Apps. An attacker with minimal privileges in the application can build their own App and upload a malicious file containing an XSS payload, by uploading an arbitrary file and modifying the MIME type in a subsequent HTTP request. This then allows the file to be stored and retrieved from the server by other users in the same organization.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44043", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nUipath\u00bbApp Studio\u00bbVersion:21.4.4cpe:2.3:a:uipath:app_studio:21.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-07-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.uipath.com/robot/docs/uipath-assistant", "ref_desc": "About UiPath AssistantVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2wKaVMT0ebHDpFvZGjRgrNBY_SM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.uipath.com/apps/v2021.10/docs/2021-10-1", "ref_desc": "2021.10.1Release Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
