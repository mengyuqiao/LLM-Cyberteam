{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44152", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. Because /goform/change_password_process does not verify authentication or authorization, an unauthenticated user can change the password of any existing user. This allows an attacker to change the password of any known user, thereby preventing valid users from accessing the system and granting the attacker full access to that user's account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44152", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nReprisesoftware\u00bbReprise License ManagerVersions  before (<) 15.1cpe:2.3:a:reprisesoftware:reprise_license_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "83.85% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  90.14%  83.85%  -6.29 \n 2  2024-12-02  88.97%  90.14%  +1.17 \n 3  2024-11-04  87.22%  88.97%  +1.75 \n 4  2024-09-23  85.92%  87.22%  +1.30 \n 5  2024-09-11  88.09%  85.92%  -2.17 \n 6  2024-08-28  86.80%  88.09%  +1.29 \n 7  2024-08-02  88.11%  86.80%  -1.31 \n 8  2024-07-19  87.54%  88.11%  +0.57 \n 9  2024-05-27  86.03%  87.54%  +1.51 \n 10  2024-03-06  86.60%  86.03%  -0.57 \n 11  2023-12-26  83.45%  86.60%  +3.14 \n 12  2023-11-27  76.59%  83.45%  +6.86 \n 13  2023-10-01  71.33%  76.59%  +5.26 \n 14  2023-09-16  75.41%  71.33%  -4.07 \n 15  2023-09-01  66.75%  75.41%  +8.66 \n 16  2023-08-17  59.30%  66.75%  +7.45 \n 17  2023-08-03  26.18%  59.30%  +33.13 \n 18  2023-07-20  25.95%  26.18%  +0.22 \n 19  2023-07-08  29.27%  25.95%  -3.32 \n 20  2023-07-05  33.73%  29.27%  -4.46 \n 21  2023-06-22  30.82%  33.73%  +2.91 \n 22  2023-05-25  32.23%  30.82%  -1.41 \n 23  2023-05-12  35.43%  32.23%  -3.20 \n 24  2023-05-08  29.63%  35.43%  +5.80 \n 25  2023-04-20  9.54%  29.63%  +20.09 \n 26  2023-04-01  8.71%  9.54%  +0.83 \n 27  2023-03-07  0.89%  8.71%  +7.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.reprisesoftware.com/RELEASE_NOTES", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bfg_f60oUpHB9_1D8Rclt0IyXvQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://reprisesoftware.com/admin/rlm-admin-download.php?&euagree=yes", "ref_desc": "License Administration Bundle Downloads: Reprise License Manager - RLMPatch;Product;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/irPsJHSvRq7cUOH_c5yWP81Kk4c.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165186/Reprise-License-Manager-14.2-Unauthenticated-Password-Change.html", "ref_desc": "Reprise License Manager 14.2 Unauthenticated Password Change \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
