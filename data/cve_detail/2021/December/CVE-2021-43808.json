{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43808", "Description": "Laravel is a web application framework. Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that is unique to each request.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43808", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nLaravel\u00bbFrameworkVersions  before (<) 6.20.42cpe:2.3:a:laravel:framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLaravel\u00bbFrameworkVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.75.0cpe:2.3:a:laravel:framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLaravel\u00bbFrameworkVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.30.6cpe:2.3:a:laravel:framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-13  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-30  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-14  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.18%  0.11%  -1.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39908", "ref_desc": "[6.x] Fix parent call by driesvints \u00b7 Pull Request #39908 \u00b7 laravel/framework \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v7.30.6", "ref_desc": "Release v7.30.6 \u00b7 laravel/framework \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v6.20.42", "ref_desc": "Release v6.20.42 \u00b7 laravel/framework \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/b8174169b1807f36de1837751599e2828ceddb9b", "ref_desc": "[6.x] Fix parent call (#39908) \u00b7 laravel/framework@b817416 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v8.75.0", "ref_desc": "Release v8.75.0 \u00b7 laravel/framework \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-66hf-2p6w-jqfw", "ref_desc": "Blade `@parent` Exploitation Leading To Possible XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 laravel/framework \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39906", "ref_desc": "Parent replacement fix by taylorotwell \u00b7 Pull Request #39906 \u00b7 laravel/framework \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39909", "ref_desc": "[7.x] Fix parent call by GrahamCampbell \u00b7 Pull Request #39909 \u00b7 laravel/framework \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
