{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43843", "Description": "jsx-slack is a package for building JSON objects for Slack block kit surfaces from JSX. The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43843", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nJsx-slack Project\u00bbJsx-slack\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.5.2cpe:2.3:a:jsx-slack_project:jsx-slack:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.30%  0.32%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-04  0.26%  0.30%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-07-26  0.23%  0.26%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-03-13  0.17%  0.23%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-08-11  0.15%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-07-28  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-07-13  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-06-02  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.10%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security/advisories/GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in jsx-slack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yhatt/jsx-slack \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3iA9INBZnnp7xbg98_ZyMqTNyuc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/releases/tag/v4.5.2", "ref_desc": "Release v4.5.2 \u00b7 yhatt/jsx-slack \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/commit/46bc88391d89d5fda4ce689e18ca080bcdd29ecc", "ref_desc": "Prevent catastrophic backtracking in blockquote escape replacer \u00b7 yhatt/jsx-slack@46bc883 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security/advisories/GHSA-hp68-xhvj-x6j6", "ref_desc": "Insufficient patch for Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) to jsx-slack v4.5.1 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yhatt/jsx-slack \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
