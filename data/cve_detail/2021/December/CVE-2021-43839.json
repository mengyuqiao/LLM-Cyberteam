{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43839", "Description": "Cronos is a commercial implementation of a blockchain. In Cronos nodes running versions before v0.6.5, it is possible to take transaction fees from Cosmos SDK's FeeCollector for the current block by sending a custom crafted MsgEthereumTx. This problem has been patched in Cronos v0.6.5. There are no tested workarounds. All validator node operators are recommended to upgrade to Cronos v0.6.5 at their earliest possible convenience.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43839", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCrypto\u00bbCronosVersions  before (<) 0.6.5cpe:2.3:a:crypto:cronos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCrypto\u00bbEthermintVersions  from including (>=) 0.8.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.9.0cpe:2.3:a:crypto:ethermint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCrypto\u00bbEthermintVersions  before (<) 0.7.3cpe:2.3:a:crypto:ethermint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCrypto\u00bbEvmosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.4.2cpe:2.3:a:crypto:evmos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-05  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-27  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-14  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-06-03  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/pull/270", "ref_desc": "Problem: MsgEthereumTx wrapping tx without the extension option is not rejected by yihuang \u00b7 Pull Request #270 \u00b7 crypto-org-chain/cronos \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/security/advisories/GHSA-f854-hpxv-cw9r", "ref_desc": "Drainage of FeeCollector's Block Transaction Fees \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 crypto-org-chain/cronos \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/commit/150ef237b37ac28c8136e1c0f494932860b9ebe8", "ref_desc": "Problem: MsgEthereumTx wrapping tx without the extension option is no\u2026 \u00b7 crypto-org-chain/cronos@150ef23 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
