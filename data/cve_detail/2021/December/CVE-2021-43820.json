{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43820", "Description": "Seafile is an open source cloud storage system. A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43820", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSeafile\u00bbSeafile Server\u00bb     ProfessionalEditionVersions  before (<) 8.0.15cpe:2.3:a:seafile:seafile_server:*:*:*:*:professional:*:*:*Matching versions\nSeafile\u00bbSeafile Server\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.0.2cpe:2.3:a:seafile:seafile_server:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nSeafile\u00bbSeafile Server\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  before (<) 8.0.8cpe:2.3:a:seafile:seafile_server:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-29  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-20  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-07  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-05-27  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-server/pull/520", "ref_desc": "Validate repo_id when validate token from cache by feiniks \u00b7 Pull Request #520 \u00b7 haiwen/seafile-server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-server/security/advisories/GHSA-m3wc-jv6r-hvv8", "ref_desc": "Sync token can be used to access data from other libraries \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 haiwen/seafile-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
