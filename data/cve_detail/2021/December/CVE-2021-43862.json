{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43862", "Description": "jQuery Terminal Emulator is a plugin for creating command line interpreters in your applications. Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a low impact and limited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code for XSS payload is always visible, but an attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the application uses the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker can use this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the javascript attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror` on images is possible. This issue is fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the user can use formatting that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to highlight code in different way).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43862", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nJquery.terminal Project\u00bbJquery.terminalVersions  before (<) 2.31.1cpe:2.3:a:jquery.terminal_project:jquery.terminal:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-27  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-19  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-23  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.08%  -2.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal/commit/77eb044d0896e990d48a9157f0bc6648f81a84b5", "ref_desc": "fix Self XSS by injecting data attrbutte #727 \u00b7 jcubic/jquery.terminal@77eb044 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal/security/advisories/GHSA-x9r5-jxvq-4387", "ref_desc": "Self XSS on user input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jcubic/jquery.terminal \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal/issues/727", "ref_desc": "Self XSS \u00b7 Issue #727 \u00b7 jcubic/jquery.terminal \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal/releases/tag/2.31.1", "ref_desc": "Release 2.31.1 \u00b7 jcubic/jquery.terminal \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
