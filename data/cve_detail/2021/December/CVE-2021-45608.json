{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-45608", "Description": "Certain D-Link, Edimax, NETGEAR, TP-Link, Tenda, and Western Digital devices are affected by an integer overflow by an unauthenticated attacker. Remote code execution from the WAN interface (TCP port 20005) cannot be ruled out; however, exploitability was judged to be of \"rather significant complexity\" but not \"impossible.\" The overflow is in SoftwareBus_dispatchNormalEPMsgOut in the KCodes NetUSB kernel module. Affected NETGEAR devices are D7800 before 1.0.1.68, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.122, and R6700v3 before 1.0.4.122.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45608", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNetgear\u00bbD7800 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.1.68cpe:2.3:o:netgear:d7800_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Netgear\u00bbD7800\u00bbVersion:N/A\nNetgear\u00bbR6400v2 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.4.122cpe:2.3:o:netgear:r6400v2_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Netgear\u00bbR6400v2\u00bbVersion:N/A\nNetgear\u00bbR6700v3 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.4.122cpe:2.3:o:netgear:r6700v3_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Netgear\u00bbR6700v3\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.74% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.11%  0.74%  -0.37 \n 2  2024-12-02  1.05%  1.11%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-09-10  0.98%  1.05%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-08-01  0.73%  0.98%  +0.25 \n 5  2024-06-09  0.70%  0.73%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-03-19  0.65%  0.70%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-12-10  0.63%  0.65%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-08-02  0.61%  0.63%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-07-18  0.48%  0.61%  +0.13 \n 10  2023-06-07  0.49%  0.48%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.49%  -1.49 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/cve-2021-45608-netusb-rce-flaw-in-millions-of-end-user-routers/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-45608 | NetUSB RCE Flaw in Millions of End User Routers - SentinelOneExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kb.netgear.com/000064437/Security-Advisory-for-Pre-Authentication-Buffer-Overflow-on-Multiple-Products-PSV-2021-0278", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory for Pre-Authentication Buffer Overflow on Multiple Products, PSV-2021-0278 | Answer | NETGEAR SupportPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nh2gtgtEf-Ep0oejeFZ2Wuqi4hQ.html"}]}
