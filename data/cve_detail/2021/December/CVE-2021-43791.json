{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43791", "Description": "Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register. The issue is fixed in Zulip 4.8. There are no known workarounds and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43791", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulipVersions  before (<) 4.8cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-08  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-24  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/a014ef75a3a0ed7f24ebb157632ba58751e732c6", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-43791: Validate confirmation keys in /accounts/register/ cod\u2026 \u00b7 zulip/zulip@a014ef7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-wj76-pcqr-mf9f", "ref_desc": "Ineffective expiration validation for invitation links \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
