{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43784", "Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43784", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbRuncVersions  before (<) 1.0.3cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:runc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.82%  0.40%  -0.42 \n 2  2024-02-28  0.32%  0.82%  +0.50 \n 3  2024-02-19  0.28%  0.32%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-06-29  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-06-01  0.16%  0.23%  +0.07 \n 6  2023-03-13  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.16%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/d72d057ba794164c3cce9451a00b72a78b25e1ae", "ref_desc": "runc init: avoid netlink message length overflows \u00b7 opencontainers/runc@d72d057 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00005.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3735-1] runc security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7OCVkA58B_yafH-4cpoPCF47PX4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00005.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2841-1] runc security updateVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/f50369af4b571e358f20b139eea52d612eb55eed", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f \u00b7 opencontainers/runc@f50369a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f", "ref_desc": "Overflow in netlink bytemsg length field allows attacker to override netlink-based container configuration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencontainers/runc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554", "ref_desc": "Open bind mount sources from the host userns \u00b7 opencontainers/runc@9c44407 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2241", "ref_desc": "2241 - runc/libcontainer: insecure handling of bind mount sources - project-zeroExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
