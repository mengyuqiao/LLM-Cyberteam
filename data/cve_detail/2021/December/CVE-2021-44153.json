{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44153", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. When editing the license file, it is possible for an admin user to enable an option to run arbitrary executables, as demonstrated by an ISV demo \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\" entry. An attacker can exploit this to run a malicious binary on startup, or when triggering the Reread/Restart Servers function on the webserver. (Exploitation does not require CVE-2018-15573, because the license file is meant to be changed in the application.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44153", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nReprisesoftware\u00bbReprise License Manager\u00bbVersion:14.2cpe:2.3:a:reprisesoftware:reprise_license_manager:14.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.44% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.44%  +0.34 \n 2  2024-11-04  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 3  2023-07-05  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-22  0.13%  0.10%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-05-25  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165194/Reprise-License-Manager-14.2-Remote-Binary-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://reprisesoftware.com/admin/rlm-admin-download.php?&euagree=yes", "ref_desc": "License Administration Bundle Downloads: Reprise License Manager - RLMPatch;Product;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/irPsJHSvRq7cUOH_c5yWP81Kk4c.html"}]}
