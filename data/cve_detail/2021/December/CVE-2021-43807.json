{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43807", "Description": "Opencast is an Open Source Lecture Capture & Video Management for Education. Opencast versions prior to 9.10 allow HTTP method spoofing, allowing to change the assumed HTTP method via URL parameter. This allows attackers to turn HTTP GET requests into PUT requests or an HTTP form to send DELETE requests. This bypasses restrictions otherwise put on these types of requests and aids in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, which would otherwise not be possible. The vulnerability allows attackers to craft links or forms which may change the server state. This issue is fixed in Opencast 9.10 and 10.0. You can mitigate the problem by setting the `SameSite=Strict` attribute for your cookies. If this is a viable option for you depends on your integrations. We strongly recommend updating in any case.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43807", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nApereo\u00bbOpencastVersions  before (<) 9.10cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-08-29  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-20  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-07  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-07  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-05-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-j4mm-7pj3-jf7v", "ref_desc": "HTTP Method Spoofing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencast/opencast \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/8f8271e1085f6f8e306c689d6a56b0bb8d076444", "ref_desc": "Update CXF \u00b7 opencast/opencast@8f8271e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/59cb6731067283e54f15462be38b6117d8b9ea8b#diff-9c5fb3d1b7e3b0f54bc5c4182965c4fe1f9023d449017cece3005d3f90e8e4d8", "ref_desc": "Update CXF \u00b7 opencast/opencast@59cb673 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
