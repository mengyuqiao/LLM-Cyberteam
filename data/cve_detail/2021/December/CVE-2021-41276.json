{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41276", "Description": "Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. In affected versions Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. This issue has been patched in Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.31, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-5, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41276", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnalean\u00bbTuleap\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 13.1-1andbefore (<) 13.1-5cpe:2.3:a:enalean:tuleap:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnalean\u00bbTuleap\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  before (<) 13.2.99.31cpe:2.3:a:enalean:tuleap:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnalean\u00bbTuleap\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 13.2-1andbefore (<) 13.2-3cpe:2.3:a:enalean:tuleap:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-06  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-07-23  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.16%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-90 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/90/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-LDAP-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/security/advisories/GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm", "ref_desc": "Indirect LDAP injection via the ldap_id attribute of a user \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Enalean/tuleap \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-17QoWKvFawUverSM4ofqJjtKyE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tuleap.net/plugins/tracker/?aid=24149", "ref_desc": "Indirect LDAP injection via the ldap_id attribute of a user - request #24149 - Requests - TuleapIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/commit/bd47f29847fcd6a68d359bc8aefb8749bb8a1b7c", "ref_desc": "request #24149: Indirect LDAP injection via the ldap_id attribute of \u2026 \u00b7 Enalean/tuleap@bd47f29 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tuleap.net/plugins/git/tuleap/tuleap/stable?a=commit&h=bd47f29847fcd6a68d359bc8aefb8749bb8a1b7c", "ref_desc": "Git - TuleapPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
