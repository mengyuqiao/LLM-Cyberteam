{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44466", "Description": "Bitmask Riseup VPN 0.21.6 contains a local privilege escalation flaw due to improper access controls. When the software is installed with a non-default installation directory off of the system root, the installer fails to properly set ACLs. This allows lower privileged users to replace the VPN executable with a malicious one. When a higher privileged user such as an Administrator launches that executable, it is possible for the lower privileged user to escalate to Administrator privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44466", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nLeap\u00bbBitmask Riseup Vpn\u00bbVersion:0.21.6cpe:2.3:a:leap:bitmask_riseup_vpn:0.21.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-58", "ref_desc": "Bitmask Riseup Local Privilege Escalation - Research Advisory | Tenable\u00aePatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
