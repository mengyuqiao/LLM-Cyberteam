{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-42835", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Plex Media Server through 1.24.4.5081-e362dc1ee. An attacker (with a foothold in a endpoint via a low-privileged user account) can access the exposed RPC service of the update service component. This RPC functionality allows the attacker to interact with the RPC functionality and execute code from a path of his choice (local, or remote via SMB) because of a TOCTOU race condition. This code execution is in the context of the Plex update service (which runs as SYSTEM).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42835", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nPlex\u00bbMedia ServerVersions  before (<) 1.25.0.5282cpe:2.3:a:plex:media_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-03-01  0.11%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-30  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-07-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.74%  0.04%  -2.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://forums.plex.tv/t/security-regarding-cve-2021-42835/761510", "ref_desc": "Security: Regarding CVE-2021-42835 - Announcements - Plex ForumVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ir-on.io/2021/12/02/local-privilege-plexcalation/", "ref_desc": "Local Privilege Plexcalation - IRONExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugsec.com/experts_teams/", "ref_desc": "experts_teams - BugSecThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/", "ref_desc": "Media Server Downloads | Plex Media Server for Windows, Mac, Linux, FreeBSD and MoreProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
