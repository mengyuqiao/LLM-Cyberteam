{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43794", "Description": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In affected versions an attacker can poison the cache for anonymous (i.e. not logged in) users, such that the users are shown a JSON blob instead of the HTML page. This can lead to a partial denial-of-service. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43794", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourseVersions  before (<) 2.7.11cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-16  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-07  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-24  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-05-14  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/2da0001965c6d8632d723c46ea5df9f22a1a23f1", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Disallow caching of MIME/Content-Type errors (#14939) \u00b7 discourse/discourse@2da0001 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MIeeAd6JskCQQCsP1v1Mxu-8gRk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-249g-pc77-65hp", "ref_desc": "Anonymous user cache poisoning via development-mode header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
