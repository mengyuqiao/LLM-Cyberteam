{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43836", "Description": "Sulu is an open-source PHP content management system based on the Symfony framework. In affected versions an attacker can read arbitrary local files via a PHP file include. In a default configuration this also leads to remote code execution. The problem is patched with the Versions 1.6.44, 2.2.18, 2.3.8, 2.4.0. For users unable to upgrade overwrite the service `sulu_route.generator.expression_token_provider` and wrap the translator before passing it to the expression language.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43836", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSulu\u00bbSuluVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.8cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSulu\u00bbSuluVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.18cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSulu\u00bbSuluVersions  before (<) 1.6.44cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSulu\u00bbSulu\u00bbVersion:2.4.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:sulu:sulu:2.4.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-29  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-30  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.24%  0.28%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.24%  -1.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sulu/sulu/security/advisories/GHSA-vx6j-pjrh-vgjh", "ref_desc": "PHP file inclusion in the Sulu admin panel \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sulu/sulu \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sulu/sulu/commit/9c948f9ce350c68b53af8c3910e2cefc7f722b54", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vx6j-pjrh-vgjh \u00b7 sulu/sulu@9c948f9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
