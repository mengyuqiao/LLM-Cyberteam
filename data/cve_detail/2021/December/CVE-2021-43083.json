{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43083", "Description": "Apache PLC4X - PLC4C (Only the C language implementation was effected) was vulnerable to an unsigned integer underflow flaw inside the tcp transport. Users should update to 0.9.1, which addresses this issue. However, in order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to actively connect to a mallicious device which could send a response with invalid content. Currently we consider the probability of this being exploited as quite minimal, however this could change in the future, especially with the industrial networks growing more and more together.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43083", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbPlc4xVersions  before (<) 0.9.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:plc4x:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.19%  +0.11 \n 2  2024-11-10  0.11%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-12-16  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-12-04  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-12  0.15%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-06-01  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/jxx6qc84z60xbbhn6vp2s5qf09psrtc7", "ref_desc": "[ANNOUNCE] Apache PLC4X 0.9.1 released-Apache Mail ArchivesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/20/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-43083: Apache PLC4X 0.9.0 Buffer overflow in PLC4C via crafted server responseMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
