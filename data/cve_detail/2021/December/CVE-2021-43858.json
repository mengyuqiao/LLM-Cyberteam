{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43858", "Description": "MinIO is a Kubernetes native application for cloud storage. Prior to version `RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z`, a malicious client can hand-craft an HTTP API call that allows for updating policy for a user and gaining higher privileges. The patch in version `RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z` changes the accepted request body type and removes the ability to apply policy changes through this API. There is a workaround for this vulnerability: Changing passwords can be disabled by adding an explicit `Deny` rule to disable the API for users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43858", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinioVersions  before (<) 2021-12-27t07-23-18zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.13%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-08-18  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-04  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-20  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-13  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-03  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-j6jc-jqqc-p6cx", "ref_desc": "User privilege escalation in AddUser() admin API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13976", "ref_desc": "fix: user privilege escalation bug by donatello \u00b7 Pull Request #13976 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/7949", "ref_desc": "Update on-disk storage format for users system by donatello \u00b7 Pull Request #7949 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z", "ref_desc": "Release Security Bugfix Release \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/5a96cbbeaabd0a82b0fe881378e7c21c85091abf", "ref_desc": "Fix user privilege escalation bug (#13976) \u00b7 minio/minio@5a96cbb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
