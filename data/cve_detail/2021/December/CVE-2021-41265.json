{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41265", "Description": "Flask-AppBuilder is a development framework built on top of Flask. Verions prior to 3.3.4 contain an improper authentication vulnerability in the REST API. The issue allows for a malicious actor with a carefully crafted request to successfully authenticate and gain access to existing protected REST API endpoints. This only affects non database authentication types and new REST API endpoints. Users should upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.3.4 to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41265", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFlask-appbuilder Project\u00bbFlask-appbuilderVersions  before (<) 3.3.4cpe:2.3:a:flask-appbuilder_project:flask-appbuilder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-31  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-07-17  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-02  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-22  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/releases/tag/v3.3.4", "ref_desc": "Release 3.3.4 \u00b7 dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/commit/eba517aab121afa3f3f2edb011ec6bc4efd61fbc", "ref_desc": "chore: improve schema validation (#1712) \u00b7 dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder@eba517a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/security/advisories/GHSA-m3rf-7m4w-r66q", "ref_desc": "Improper Authentication in Flask-AppBuilder \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
