{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43803", "Description": "Next.js is a React framework. In versions of Next.js prior to 12.0.5 or 11.1.3, invalid or malformed URLs could lead to a server crash. In order to be affected by this issue, the deployment must use Next.js versions above 11.1.0 and below 12.0.5, Node.js above 15.0.0, and next start or a custom server. Deployments on Vercel are not affected, along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js. Versions 12.0.5 and 11.1.3 contain patches for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43803", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nVercel\u00bbNext.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andbefore (<) 12.0.5cpe:2.3:a:vercel:next.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Nodejs\u00bbNode.js\nVercel\u00bbNext.js\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 11.1.0andbefore (<) 11.1.3cpe:2.3:a:vercel:next.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Nodejs\u00bbNode.js", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.31%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.28%  0.23%  -0.06 \n 3  2024-07-15  0.39%  0.28%  -0.11 \n 4  2024-06-19  0.37%  0.39%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-31  0.36%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-07-17  0.46%  0.36%  -0.10 \n 7  2023-07-02  0.65%  0.46%  -0.19 \n 8  2023-05-22  0.92%  0.65%  -0.27 \n 9  2023-03-16  1.62%  0.92%  -0.70 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.02%  1.62%  +0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/v12.0.5", "ref_desc": "Release v12.0.5 \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v11.1.3", "ref_desc": "Release v11.1.3 \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/32080", "ref_desc": "Fix server be killed by handling unhandled promise with status 500 by chentsulin \u00b7 Pull Request #32080 \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-25mp-g6fv-mqxx", "ref_desc": "Unexpected server crash in Next.js versions above 11.1.0 and below 12.0.5 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vercel/next.js \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/6d98b4fb4315dec1badecf0e9bdc212a4272b264", "ref_desc": "Ensure invalid URLs respond with 400 correctly (#32092) \u00b7 vercel/next.js@6d98b4f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
