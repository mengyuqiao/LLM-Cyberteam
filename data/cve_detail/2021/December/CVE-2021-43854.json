{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43854", "Description": "NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43854", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNltk\u00bbNltkVersions  before (<) 3.6.5cpe:2.3:a:nltk:nltk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.42%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-11-28  0.37%  0.39%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-07  0.31%  0.37%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-07-29  0.27%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-06-20  0.27%  0.27%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-03-16  0.21%  0.27%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-09-12  0.20%  0.21%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-08-14  0.13%  0.20%  +0.07 \n 9  2023-07-31  0.10%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-07-16  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 11  2023-06-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 12  2023-03-07  2.40%  0.09%  -2.31 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nltk/nltk/commit/1405aad979c6b8080dbbc8e0858f89b2e3690341", "ref_desc": "Resolved serious ReDoS in PunktSentenceTokenizer (#2869) \u00b7 nltk/nltk@1405aad \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nltk/nltk/security/advisories/GHSA-f8m6-h2c7-8h9x", "ref_desc": "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nltk (word_tokenize, sent_tokenize) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nltk/nltk \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/2866", "ref_desc": "word_tokenize/EN hangs on incorrect strings \u00b7 Issue #2866 \u00b7 nltk/nltk \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nltk/nltk/pull/2869", "ref_desc": "Resolved serious ReDoS in PunktSentenceTokenizer by tomaarsen \u00b7 Pull Request #2869 \u00b7 nltk/nltk \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
