{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43815", "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana prior to versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 has a directory traversal for arbitrary .csv files. It only affects instances that have the developer testing tool called TestData DB data source enabled and configured. The vulnerability is limited in scope, and only allows access to files with the extension .csv to authenticated users only. Grafana Cloud instances have not been affected by the vulnerability. Versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 contain a patch for this issue. There is a workaround available for users who cannot upgrade. Running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana that normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. The proxy will have to also be able to handle url encoded paths.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43815", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.3.2cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGrafana\u00bbGrafanaVersions  before (<) 7.5.12cpe:2.3:a:grafana:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-07-03  0.17%  0.12%  -0.05 \n 3  2023-03-17  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.16%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/fd48aee61e4328aae8d5303a9efd045fa0ca308d", "ref_desc": "chore(release-notes): add release notes for 8.2.3 and 7.5.12 (#42987) \u00b7 grafana/grafana@fd48aee \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6HE9bvaSt04tXobdTL8Sn0GLhVk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220107-0006/", "ref_desc": "January 2022 Grafana Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/APgotE58w6L42F-5td4J8eYIrqg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases/tag/v8.3.2", "ref_desc": "Release 8.3.2 (2021-12-10) \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-7533-c8qv-jm9m", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-43815: Grafana directory traversal for `.csv` files, 8.0.0-beta3 - 8.3.1 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 grafana/grafana \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/d6ec6f8ad28f0212e584406730f939105ff6c6d3", "ref_desc": "Backport fix to main (#42979) \u00b7 grafana/grafana@d6ec6f8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://grafana.com/blog/2021/12/10/grafana-8.3.2-and-7.5.12-released-with-moderate-severity-security-fix/", "ref_desc": "Grafana 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 released with moderate severity security fix | Grafana LabsPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tNSbrGBIkiBNoyGQ3C6Eq1mLz88.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/10/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-43813 and CVE-2021-43815 - Grafana directory traversal for some .md and .csv filesMailing List;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XjTFvUE43En8vmZnGkRuNVaOR6Q.html"}]}
