{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43800", "Description": "Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Prior to version 2.5.254, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number 414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities (Local File System, Git).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43800", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nRequarks\u00bbWiki.jsVersions  before (<) 2.5.245cpe:2.3:a:requarks:wiki.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-08-21  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-12  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-06-16  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-29  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 6  2023-05-19  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85", "ref_desc": "fix: asset path traversal on windows \u00b7 Requarks/wiki@414033d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-r363-73gj-6j25", "ref_desc": "Asset directory traversal with some storage modules on Windows \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/releases/tag/2.5.254", "ref_desc": "Release 2.5.254 \u00b7 Requarks/wiki \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
