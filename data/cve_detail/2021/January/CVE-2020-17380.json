{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-17380", "Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow was found in QEMU through 5.0.0 in the SDHCI device emulation support. It could occur while doing a multi block SDMA transfer via the sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() routine in hw/sd/sdhci.c. A guest user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on the host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-17380", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nQemu\u00bbQemuVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.0.0cpe:2.3:a:qemu:qemu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.37%  0.05%  -1.31 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-09/msg01175.html", "ref_desc": "[PATCH v1] sd: sdhci: assert data_count is within fifo_bufferMailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/04/msg00009.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2623-1] qemu security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KqXncRikuCvjC29HOFXxtuqHB9s.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/09/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2021-3409 QEMU: sdhci: incomplete fix for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085Mailing List;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o-3b1kf0CMFE3D6tcKAxXFoo1vM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210312-0003/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-17380 QEMU Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1862167", "ref_desc": "1862167 \u2013 (CVE-2020-17380) CVE-2020-17380 QEMU: heap buffer overflow in sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() in hw/sd/sdhci.cIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
