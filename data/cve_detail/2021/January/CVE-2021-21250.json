{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21250", "Description": "OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is a critical vulnerability which may lead to arbitrary file read. When BuildSpec is provided in XML format, the spec is processed by XmlBuildSpecMigrator.migrate(buildSpecString); which processes the XML document without preventing the expansion of external entities. These entities can be configured to read arbitrary files from the file system and dump their contents in the final XML document to be migrated. If the files are dumped in properties included in the YAML file, it will be possible for an attacker to read them. If not, it is possible for an attacker to exfiltrate the contents of these files Out Of Band. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by ignoring ENTITY instructions in xml file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21250", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOnedev Project\u00bbOnedevVersions  before (<) 4.0.3cpe:2.3:a:onedev_project:onedev:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-538 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/538/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Externally-Accessibl.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-9pph-8gfc-6w2r", "ref_desc": "Post-Auth External Entity Expansion (XXE) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 theonedev/onedev \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/9196fd795e87dab069b4260a3590a0ea886e770f", "ref_desc": "Fix XXE injection attack by disabling XML DTD handling \u00b7 theonedev/onedev@9196fd7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
