{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21259", "Description": "HedgeDoc is open source software which lets you create real-time collaborative markdown notes. In HedgeDoc before version 1.7.2, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into a HedgeDoc note, which is executed when the note is viewed in slide mode. Depending on the configuration of the instance, the attacker may not need authentication to create or edit notes. The problem is patched in HedgeDoc 1.7.2. As a workaround, disallow loading JavaScript from 3rd party sites using the `Content-Security-Policy` header. Note that this will break some embedded content.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21259", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nHedgedoc\u00bbHedgedocVersions  before (<) 1.7.2cpe:2.3:a:hedgedoc:hedgedoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-10-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-29  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/issues/1648", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in slide mode (via reveal-markdown) \u00b7 Issue #1648 \u00b7 hackmdio/codimd \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/35b0d39a12aa35f27fba8c1f50b1886706e7efef", "ref_desc": "added sanitation to the slideMode in frontmatter \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc@35b0d39 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/releases/tag/1.7.2", "ref_desc": "Release HedgeDoc 1.7.2 \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-44w9-vm8p-3cxw", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in slide mode \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
