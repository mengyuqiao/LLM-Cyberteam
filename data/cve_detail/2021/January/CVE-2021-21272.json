{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21272", "Description": "ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21272", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nDeislabs\u00bbOrasVersions  from including (>=) 0.4.0andbefore (<) 0.9.0cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-02-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 \n 5  2023-02-22  6.73%  0.95%  -5.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/oras", "ref_desc": "oras \u00b7 pkg.go.devThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/deislabs/oras/commit/96cd90423303f1bb42bd043cb4c36085e6e91e8e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-g5v4-5x39-vwhx \u00b7 deislabs/oras@96cd904 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/deislabs/oras/releases/tag/v0.9.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.9.0 \u00b7 deislabs/oras \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/deislabs/oras/security/advisories/GHSA-g5v4-5x39-vwhx", "ref_desc": "Tarballs with links can escape working directory upon extraction (\"zip slip\") \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 deislabs/oras \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
