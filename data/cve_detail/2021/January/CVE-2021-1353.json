{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1353", "Description": "A vulnerability in the IPv4 protocol handling of Cisco StarOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a memory leak that occurs during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted IPv4 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the available memory and cause an unexpected restart of the npusim process, leading to a DoS condition on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1353", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbStarosVersions  before (<) 21.22.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:staros:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 5000\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 5500\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsr 5700\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbVirtualized Packet Core-single Instance\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:virtualized_packet_core-single_instance:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-06  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-08-27  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr-mem-leak-dos-MTWGHKk3", "ref_desc": "Cisco StarOS IPv4 Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
