{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1129", "Description": "A vulnerability in the authentication for the general purpose APIs implementation of Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA), and Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access general system information and certain configuration information from an affected device. The vulnerability exists because a secure authentication token is not required when authenticating to the general purpose API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request for information to the general purpose API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain system and configuration information from the affected device, resulting in an unauthorized information disclosure.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1129", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:11.8.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:11.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbContent Security Management Appliance\u00bbVersion:12.5.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:content_security_management_appliance:12.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:13.0.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:13.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-24  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-06  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-08-27  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/201/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-Into-Sent-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-wsa-sma-info-RHp44vAC", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance, Cisco Content Security Management Appliance, and Cisco Web Security Appliance Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
