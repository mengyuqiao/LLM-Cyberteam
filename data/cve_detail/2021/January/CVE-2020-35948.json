{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35948", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the XCloner Backup and Restore plugin before 4.2.13 for WordPress. It gave authenticated attackers the ability to modify arbitrary files, including PHP files. Doing so would allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution. The xcloner_restore.php write_file_action could overwrite wp-config.php, for example. Alternatively, an attacker could create an exploit chain to obtain a database dump.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35948", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXcloner\u00bbXcloner\u00bbForWordpressVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.1andbefore (<) 4.2.13cpe:2.3:a:xcloner:xcloner:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "58.59% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  14.65%  58.59%  +43.94 \n 2  2024-09-18  14.81%  14.65%  -0.15 \n 3  2024-06-06  14.24%  14.81%  +0.57 \n 4  2024-02-03  10.69%  14.24%  +3.55 \n 5  2023-11-23  7.84%  10.69%  +2.85 \n 6  2023-09-16  8.25%  7.84%  -0.40 \n 7  2023-06-15  7.99%  8.25%  +0.26 \n 8  2023-03-07  10.12%  7.99%  -2.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163336/WordPress-XCloner-4.2.12-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "WordPress XCloner 4.2.12 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/09/critical-vulnerabilities-patched-in-xcloner-backup-and-restore-plugin/", "ref_desc": "Critical Vulnerabilities Patched in XCloner Backup and Restore PluginExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4_8Y9xkbutb3YIE6CDdazAH79ps.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/10412", "ref_desc": "XCloner Backup and Restore 4.2.1 - 4.2.12 - Unprotected AJAX Action Security VulnerabilityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Hacker5preme/Exploits/tree/main/Wordpress/CVE-2020-35948", "ref_desc": "Exploits/Wordpress/CVE-2020-35948 at main \u00b7 Hacker5preme/Exploits \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
