{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21236", "Description": "CairoSVG is a Python (pypi) package. CairoSVG is an SVG converter based on Cairo. In CairoSVG before version 2.5.1, there is a regular expression denial of service (REDoS) vulnerability. When processing SVG files, the python package CairoSVG uses two regular expressions which are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS). If an attacker provides a malicious SVG, it can make cairosvg get stuck processing the file for a very long time. This is fixed in version 2.5.1. See Referenced GitHub advisory for more information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21236", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCourtbouillon\u00bbCairosvgVersions  before (<) 2.5.1cpe:2.3:a:courtbouillon:cairosvg:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-09-22  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-13  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-31  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/CairoSVG/", "ref_desc": "CairoSVG \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/commit/cfc9175e590531d90384aa88845052de53d94bf3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hq37-853p-g5cf \u00b7 Kozea/CairoSVG@cfc9175 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/security/advisories/GHSA-hq37-853p-g5cf", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Kozea/CairoSVG \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/releases/tag/2.5.1", "ref_desc": "Release 2.5.1 \u00b7 Kozea/CairoSVG \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
