{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35391", "Description": "Tenda N300 F3 12.01.01.48 devices allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (possibly including an http_passwd line) via a direct request for cgi-bin/DownloadCfg/RouterCfm.cfg, a related issue to CVE-2017-14942. NOTE: the vulnerability report may suggest that either a ? character must be placed after the RouterCfm.cfg filename, or that the HTTP request headers must be unusual, but it is not known why these are relevant to the device's HTTP response behavior.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35391", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTenda\u00bbF3 Firmware\u00bbVersion:12.01.01.48cpe:2.3:o:tenda:f3_firmware:12.01.01.48:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Tenda\u00bbF3\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-18  0.25%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-01-05  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.37%  0.24%  -0.12 \n 4  2023-09-17  0.32%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-08-08  0.32%  0.32%  0.00 \n 6  2023-04-11  0.35%  0.32%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-03-26  0.26%  0.35%  +0.09 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.65%  0.26%  -1.39 \n 9  2023-02-06  1.06%  1.65%  +0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/425/Direct-Request-Forced-Browsing-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://medium.com/@signalhilltech/tenda-n300-authentication-bypass-via-malformed-http-request-header-5b8744ca685e", "ref_desc": "Tenda N300 Authentication Bypass via Malformed HTTP Request Header - Signal Hill Technologies - MediumExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171773/Tenda-N300-F3-12.01.01.48-Header-Processing.html", "ref_desc": "Tenda N300 F3 12.01.01.48 Header Processing \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
