{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21243", "Description": "OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, a Kubernetes REST endpoint exposes two methods that deserialize untrusted data from the request body. These endpoints do not enforce any authentication or authorization checks. This issue may lead to pre-auth RCE. This issue was fixed in 4.0.3 by not using deserialization at KubernetesResource side.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21243", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOnedev Project\u00bbOnedevVersions  before (<) 4.0.3cpe:2.3:a:onedev_project:onedev:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.57%  1.11%  -0.46 \n 2  2023-10-01  1.94%  1.57%  -0.38 \n 3  2023-03-25  1.96%  1.94%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  1.96%  +1.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-9mmq-fm8c-q4fv", "ref_desc": "Pre-Auth Unsafe Deserialization on KubernetesResource \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 theonedev/onedev \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/9637fc8fa461c5777282a0021c3deb1e7a48f137", "ref_desc": "Do not deserialize data from job nodes in Kubernetes resource to avoid \u00b7 theonedev/onedev@9637fc8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
