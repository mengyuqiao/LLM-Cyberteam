{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26293", "Description": "HtmlSanitizer is a .NET library for cleaning HTML fragments and documents from constructs that can lead to XSS attacks. In HtmlSanitizer before version 5.0.372, there is a possible XSS bypass if style tag is allowed. If you have explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing through the sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `<style>` tag so there is no risk if you have not explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag. The problem has been fixed in version 5.0.372.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26293", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nHtmlsanitizer Project\u00bbHtmlsanitizerVersions  before (<) 5.0.372cpe:2.3:a:htmlsanitizer_project:htmlsanitizer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-11-08  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 3  2023-08-11  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlSanitizer/", "ref_desc": "NuGet Gallery | HtmlSanitizer 5.0.372Product;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/releases/tag/v5.0.372", "ref_desc": "Release 5.0.372 \u00b7 mganss/HtmlSanitizer \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-8j9v-h2vp-2hhv", "ref_desc": "Possible XSS bypass if style tag is allowed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mganss/HtmlSanitizer \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/commit/a3a7602a44d4155d51ec0fbbedc2a49e9c7e2eb8", "ref_desc": "Fix hex escape issue in style element \u00b7 mganss/HtmlSanitizer@a3a7602 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
