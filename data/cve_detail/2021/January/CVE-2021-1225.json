{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1225", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface improperly validates values in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the application and sending malicious SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify values on or return values from the underlying database or the operating system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1225", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan VmanageVersions  before (<) 19.2.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan_vmanage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-24  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-10-06  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.12%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vman-sqlinjm-xV8dsjq5", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage SQL Injection VulnerabilitiesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
