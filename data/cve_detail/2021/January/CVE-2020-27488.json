{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27488", "Description": "Loxone Miniserver devices with firmware before 11.1 (aka 11.1.9.3) are unable to use an authentication method that is based on the \"signature of the update package.\" Therefore, these devices (or attackers who are spoofing these devices) can continue to use an unauthenticated cloud service for an indeterminate time period (possibly forever). Once an individual device's firmware is updated, and authentication occurs once, the cloud service recategorizes the device so that authentication is subsequently always required, and spoofing cannot occur.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27488", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nLoxone\u00bbMiniserver Gen 1 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 11.1.9.3cpe:2.3:o:loxone:miniserver_gen_1_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Loxone\u00bbMiniserver Gen 1\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.65%  0.79%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-09-30  0.56%  0.65%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-08-27  0.46%  0.56%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-05-18  0.38%  0.46%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-09-29  0.35%  0.38%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-08-20  0.35%  0.35%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-04-07  0.29%  0.35%  +0.06 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.29%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.loxone.com/dede/sicherheit-cloud-dns/", "ref_desc": "Sicherheitsverbesserungen am Loxone Cloud DNS - Loxone BlogProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://iot-lab-fh-ooe.github.io/loxone_clouddns_vulnerability/", "ref_desc": "Advisory - Loxone Cloud DNS VulnerabilityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.loxone.com/enen/security-cloud-dns/", "ref_desc": "Security Improvements for Loxone Cloud DNS - Loxone BlogVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://iot-lab-fh-ooe.github.io/loxone_clouddns_schwachstelle/", "ref_desc": "Advisory - Schwachstelle im Loxone Cloud DNSExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
