{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21261", "Description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly. This is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21261", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 0.11.4andbefore (<) 1.8.5cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.1andbefore (<) 1.10.0cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.61%  0.05%  -1.55 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-21", "ref_desc": "Flatpak: Sandbox escape (GLSA 202101-21) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6e5ae7a109cdfa9735ea7ccbd8cb79f9e8d3ae8b", "ref_desc": "context: Add --env-fd option \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@6e5ae7a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/1.8.5", "ref_desc": "Release Release 1.8.5 \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-4ppf-fxf6-vxg2", "ref_desc": "Flatpak sandbox escape via spawn portal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6d1773d2a54dde9b099043f07a2094a4f1c2f486", "ref_desc": "run: Convert all environment variables into bwrap arguments \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@6d1773d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/aeb6a7ab0abaac4a8f4ad98b3df476d9de6b8bd4", "ref_desc": "portal: Convert --env in extra-args into --env-fd \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@aeb6a7a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/cc1401043c075268ecc652eac557ef8076b5eaba", "ref_desc": "portal: Do not use caller-supplied variables in environment \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@cc14010 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4830", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4830-1 flatpakThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
