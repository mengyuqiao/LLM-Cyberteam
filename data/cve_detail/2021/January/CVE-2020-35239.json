{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35239", "Description": "A vulnerability exists in CakePHP versions 4.0.x through 4.1.3. The CsrfProtectionMiddleware component allows method override parameters to bypass CSRF checks by changing the HTTP request method to an arbitrary string that is not in the list of request methods that CakePHP checks. Additionally, the route middleware does not verify that this overriden method (which can be an arbitrary string) is actually an HTTP method.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35239", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCakefoundation\u00bbCakephpVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 4.1.3cpe:2.3:a:cakefoundation:cakephp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-20  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-10-06  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 3  2023-09-23  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bakery.cakephp.org/2020/12/07/cakephp_4010_released.html", "ref_desc": "CakePHP 4.0.10 Released \u2014 BakeryVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
