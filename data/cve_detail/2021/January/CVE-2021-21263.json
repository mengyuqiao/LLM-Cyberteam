{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21263", "Description": "Laravel is a web application framework. Versions of Laravel before 6.20.11, 7.30.2 and 8.22.1 contain a query binding exploitation. This same exploit applies to the illuminate/database package which is used by Laravel. If a request is crafted where a field that is normally a non-array value is an array, and that input is not validated or cast to its expected type before being passed to the query builder, an unexpected number of query bindings can be added to the query. In some situations, this will simply lead to no results being returned by the query builder; however, it is possible certain queries could be affected in a way that causes the query to return unexpected results.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21263", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nLaravel\u00bbLaravelVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.22.1cpe:2.3:a:laravel:laravel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLaravel\u00bbLaravelVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.20.11cpe:2.3:a:laravel:laravel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLaravel\u00bbLaravelVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.30.2cpe:2.3:a:laravel:laravel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-23  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 3  2024-11-08  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-05  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-26  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-07-31  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/illuminate/database", "ref_desc": "illuminate/database - PackagistProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework", "ref_desc": "laravel/framework - PackagistProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-3p32-j457-pg5x", "ref_desc": "Query Binding Exploitation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 laravel/framework \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.laravel.com/security-laravel-62011-7302-8221-released", "ref_desc": "Security: Laravel 6.20.11, 7.30.2, 8.22.1 Released - The Laravel BlogVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/35865", "ref_desc": "[6.x] Limit expected bindings by taylorotwell \u00b7 Pull Request #35865 \u00b7 laravel/framework \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
