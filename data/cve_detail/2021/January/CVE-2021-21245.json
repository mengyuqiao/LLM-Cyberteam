{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21245", "Description": "OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, AttachmentUploadServlet also saves user controlled data (`request.getInputStream()`) to a user specified location (`request.getHeader(\"File-Name\")`). This issue may lead to arbitrary file upload which can be used to upload a WebShell to OneDev server. This issue is addressed in 4.0.3 by only allowing uploaded file to be in attachments folder. The webshell issue is not possible as OneDev never executes files in attachments folder.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21245", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOnedev Project\u00bbOnedevVersions  before (<) 4.0.3cpe:2.3:a:onedev_project:onedev:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.17%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.20%  0.19%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.20%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-62m2-38q5-96w9", "ref_desc": "Pre-Auth Arbitrary File Upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 theonedev/onedev \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/0c060153fb97c0288a1917efdb17cc426934dacb", "ref_desc": "Fix the issue that uploaded file can be stored anywhere OneDev has write \u00b7 theonedev/onedev@0c06015 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
