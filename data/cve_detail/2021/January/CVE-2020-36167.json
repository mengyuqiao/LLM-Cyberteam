{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-36167", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the server in Veritas Backup Exec through 16.2, 20.6 before hotfix 298543, and 21.1 before hotfix 657517. On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from the Installation folder. This library in turn attempts to load the /usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf configuration file, which may not exist. On Windows systems, this path could translate to <drive>:\\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf. A low privileged user can create a :\\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications, etc. If the system is also an Active Directory domain controller, then this can affect the entire domain.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36167", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVeritas\u00bbBackup ExecVersions  from including (>=) 21.0andbefore (<) 21.0.1200.1217cpe:2.3:a:veritas:backup_exec:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVeritas\u00bbBackup ExecVersions  from including (>=) 20.0andbefore (<) 20.0.1188.2734cpe:2.3:a:veritas:backup_exec:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.26%  +0.19 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.06%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-010", "ref_desc": "Backup Exec OpenSSL advisory | Veritas\u2122Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/429301", "ref_desc": "VU#429301 - Veritas Backup Exec is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to OPENSSLDIR locationThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SP7cScsf8JZujMnbkiKEzDjDOJ4.html"}]}
