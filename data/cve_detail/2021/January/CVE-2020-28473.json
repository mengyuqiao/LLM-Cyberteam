{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28473", "Description": "The package bottle from 0 and before 0.12.19 are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28473", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBottlepy\u00bbBottleVersions  before (<) 0.12.19cpe:2.3:a:bottlepy:bottle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.72% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.44%  0.72%  +0.28 \n 2  2023-10-04  0.38%  0.44%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-08-25  0.37%  0.38%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-12  0.14%  0.37%  +0.23 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.14%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/blog/cache-poisoning-in-popular-open-source-packages/", "ref_desc": "Cache poisoning in popular open source packages | Snyk BlogThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AQwZFeZUfl2Wj57ELVqZBefByMo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/01/msg00019.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2531-1] python-bottle security updateThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle", "ref_desc": "GitHub - bottlepy/bottle: bottle.py is a fast and simple micro-framework for python web-applications.Product;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-BOTTLE-1017108", "ref_desc": "Web Cache Poisoning in bottle | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
