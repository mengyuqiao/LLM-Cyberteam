{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-36160", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Veritas System Recovery before 21.2. On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from \\usr\\local\\ssl. This library attempts to load the from \\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file, which does not exist. By default, on Windows systems, users can create directories under C:\\. A low privileged user can create a C:\\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data and installed applications, etc. If the system is also an Active Directory domain controller, then this can affect the entire domain.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36160", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVeritas\u00bbSystem RecoveryVersions  before (<) 21.2cpe:2.3:a:veritas:system_recovery:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-017", "ref_desc": "Veritas System Recovery | Veritas\u2122Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
