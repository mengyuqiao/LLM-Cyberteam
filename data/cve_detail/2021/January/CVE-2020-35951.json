{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35951", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin before 7.0.1 for WordPress. It allows users to delete arbitrary files such as wp-config.php file, which could effectively take a site offline and allow an attacker to reinstall with a WordPress instance under their control. This occurred via qsm_remove_file_fd_question, which allowed unauthenticated deletions (even though it was only intended for a person to delete their own quiz-answer files).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35951", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nExpresstech\u00bbQuiz And Survey Master\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 7.0.1cpe:2.3:a:expresstech:quiz_and_survey_master:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.58%  +0.38 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-10-12  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-09-16  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-21  0.19%  0.16%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-06-15  0.22%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/08/critical-vulnerabilities-patched-in-quiz-and-survey-master-plugin/", "ref_desc": "Critical Vulnerabilities Patched in Quiz and Survey Master PluginExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4fhLAJe0Py0fZKcnA9aeKDvUJfc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/10348", "ref_desc": "Quiz and Survey Master < 7.0.1 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion Security VulnerabilityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
