{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27542", "Description": "Rostelecom CS-C2SHW 5.0.082.1 is affected by: Bash command injection. The camera reads configuration from QR code (including network settings). The static IP configuration from QR code is copied to the file /config/ip-static and after reboot data from this file is inserted into bash command (without any escaping). So bash injection is possible. Camera doesn't parse QR codes if it's already successfully configured. Camera is always rebooted after successful configuration via QR code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27542", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCompany\u00bbCs-c2shw Firmware\u00bbVersion:5.0.082.1cpe:2.3:o:company:cs-c2shw_firmware:5.0.082.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Company\u00bbCs-c2shw\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "2.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  2.45%  +2.32 \n 2  2024-08-04  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-17  0.17%  0.12%  -0.05 \n 4  2024-06-30  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-05-30  0.16%  0.15%  -0.02 \n 6  2024-02-28  0.17%  0.16%  0.00 \n 7  2024-02-12  0.11%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-10-11  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-09-01  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 10  2023-05-01  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.11%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://dil4rd.medium.com/groundhog-day-in-iot-valley-or-5-cves-in-1-camera-7dc1d2864707", "ref_desc": "Groundhog Day in IoT Valley, or 5 CVEs in 1 Camera | by Andrey Lovyannikov | MediumExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lCVex-tWFyawSyC1fW0si40W8tA.html"}]}
