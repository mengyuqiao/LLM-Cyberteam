{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26297", "Description": "mdBook is a utility to create modern online books from Markdown files and is written in Rust. In mdBook before version 0.4.5, there is a vulnerability affecting the search feature of mdBook, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the page. The search feature of mdBook (introduced in version 0.1.4) was affected by a cross site scripting vulnerability that allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on an user's browser by tricking the user into typing a malicious search query, or tricking the user into clicking a link to the search page with the malicious search query prefilled. mdBook 0.4.5 fixes the vulnerability by properly escaping the search query. Owners of websites built with mdBook have to upgrade to mdBook 0.4.5 or greater and rebuild their website contents with it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26297", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRust-lang\u00bbMdbook\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.1.4andbefore (<) 0.4.5cpe:2.3:a:rust-lang:mdbook:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-08  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 3  2024-10-24  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-20  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-11  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-07-16  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#mdbook-045", "ref_desc": "mdBook/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 rust-lang/mdBook \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/security/advisories/GHSA-gx5w-rrhp-f436", "ref_desc": "XSS in mdBook's search page \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-lang/mdBook \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/commit/32abeef088e98327ca0dfccdad92e84afa9d2e9b", "ref_desc": "fix xss in the search page \u00b7 rust-lang/mdBook@32abeef \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/3-sO6of29O0", "ref_desc": "mdBook security advisory - 2021-01-04Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://crates.io/crates/mdbook", "ref_desc": "mdbook - crates.io: Rust Package RegistryProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
