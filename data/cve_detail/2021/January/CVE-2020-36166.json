{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-36166", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Veritas InfoScale 7.x through 7.4.2 on Windows, Storage Foundation through 6.1 on Windows, Storage Foundation HA through 6.1 on Windows, and InfoScale Operations Manager (aka VIOM) Windows Management Server 7.x through 7.4.2. On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from \\usr\\local\\ssl. This library attempts to load the \\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file, which may not exist. On Windows systems, this path could translate to <drive>:\\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf, where <drive> could be the default Windows installation drive such as C:\\ or the drive where a Veritas product is installed. By default, on Windows systems, users can create directories under any top-level directory. A low privileged user can create a <drive>:\\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications, etc.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36166", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVeritas\u00bbInfoscaleVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.4.2cpe:2.3:a:veritas:infoscale:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nVeritas\u00bbInfoscale Operations ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.4.2cpe:2.3:a:veritas:infoscale_operations_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nVeritas\u00bbStorage FoundationVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.1cpe:2.3:a:veritas:storage_foundation:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nVeritas\u00bbStorage Foundation And High AvailabilityVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.1cpe:2.3:a:veritas:storage_foundation_and_high_availability:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-014", "ref_desc": "InfoScale OpenSSL advisory | Veritas\u2122Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
