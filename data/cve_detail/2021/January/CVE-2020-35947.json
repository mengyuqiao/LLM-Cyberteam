{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35947", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the PageLayer plugin before 1.1.2 for WordPress. Nearly all of the AJAX action endpoints lacked permission checks, allowing these actions to be executed by anyone authenticated on the site. This happened because nonces were used as a means of authorization, but a nonce was present in a publicly viewable page. The greatest impact was the pagelayer_save_content function that allowed pages to be modified and allowed XSS to occur.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35947", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPagelayer\u00bbPagelayer\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 1.1.2cpe:2.3:a:pagelayer:pagelayer:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/05/high-severity-vulnerabilities-in-pagelayer-plugin-affect-over-200000-wordpress-sites/", "ref_desc": "High Severity Vulnerabilities in PageLayer Plugin Affect Over 200,000 WordPress SitesExploit;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Iuo3Tb-9kLGeFOc1fDG7CDvzY5w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/10239", "ref_desc": "Page Builder: PageLayer - Drag and Drop website builder < 1.1.2 - Unprotected AJAX's leading to XSS Security VulnerabilityExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
