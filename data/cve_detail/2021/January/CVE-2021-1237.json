{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1237", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Network Access Manager and Web Security Agent components of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL injection attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of resources that are loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a configuration file in a specific path in the system which, in turn, causes a malicious DLL file to be loaded when the application starts. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with SYSTEM privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1237", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAnyconnect Secure Mobility Client\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 4.9.04043cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-dll-injec-pQnryXLf", "ref_desc": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows DLL Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
