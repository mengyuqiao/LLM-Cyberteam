{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1272", "Description": "A vulnerability in the session validation feature of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on a targeted system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of parameters in a specific HTTP request by an attacker. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an authenticated user of the DCNM web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to the Device Manager application, which provides access to network devices managed by the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1272", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbData Center Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 11.5\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:data_center_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-23  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-02-07  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-06  0.17%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-08-27  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 5  2023-04-14  0.18%  0.17%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.18%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-ssrf-F2vX6q5p", "ref_desc": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager Server-Side Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
