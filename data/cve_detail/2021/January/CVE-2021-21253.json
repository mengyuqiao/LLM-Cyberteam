{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21253", "Description": "OnlineVotingSystem is an open source project hosted on GitHub. OnlineVotingSystem before version 1.1.2 hashes user passwords without a salt, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Therefore there is a threat of security breach in the voting system. Without a salt, it is much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables to crack passwords. This problem is fixed and published in version 1.1.2. A long randomly generated salt is added to the password hash function to better protect passwords stored in the voting system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21253", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOnlinevotingsystem Project\u00bbOnlinevotingsystemVersions  before (<) 1.1.2cpe:2.3:a:onlinevotingsystem_project:onlinevotingsystem:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-08-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-759 Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/759/Use-of-a-One-Way-Hash-without-a-Salt.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbijaya/OnlineVotingSystem/commit/0181cb0272857696c8eb3e44fcf6cb014ff90f09", "ref_desc": "Add a salt to SHA-256 hash \u00b7 dbijaya/OnlineVotingSystem@0181cb0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dbijaya/OnlineVotingSystem/security/advisories/GHSA-wwg8-372v-v332", "ref_desc": "Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dbijaya/OnlineVotingSystem \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
