{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21235", "Description": "kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21235", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKamadak-exif Project\u00bbKamadak-exif\u00bbVersion:0.5.2ForRustcpe:2.3:a:kamadak-exif_project:kamadak-exif:0.5.2:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.36%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-11-10  0.23%  0.31%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-10-26  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-09-21  0.13%  0.19%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-08-12  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-07-17  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://crates.io/crates/kamadak-exif", "ref_desc": "crates.io: Rust Package RegistryProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kamadak/exif-rs/commit/f21df24616ea611c5d5d0e0e2f8042eb74d5ff48", "ref_desc": "Fix an infinite loop in reading PNG files. \u00b7 kamadak/exif-rs@f21df24 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kamadak/exif-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-px9g-8hgv-jvg2", "ref_desc": "Infinite loop in parsing PNG files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kamadak/exif-rs \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
