{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21238", "Description": "PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21238", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPysaml2 Project\u00bbPysaml2Versions  before (<) 6.5.0cpe:2.3:a:pysaml2_project:pysaml2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-25  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 3  2024-11-10  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-07  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-02  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/commit/1d8fd268f5bf887480a403a7a5ef8f048157cc14", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-f4g9-h89h-jgv9 \u00b7 IdentityPython/pysaml2@1d8fd26 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/releases/tag/v6.5.0", "ref_desc": "Release Version 6.5.0 \u00b7 IdentityPython/pysaml2 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/O2N1aLJ_GelLCPw9HMNDwxxAewc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-f4g9-h89h-jgv9", "ref_desc": "Processing of invalid SAML XML documents \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 IdentityPython/pysaml2 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/pysaml2", "ref_desc": "pysaml2 \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uMt4G0__FR5Aj0I9cxbTkT76qY4.html"}]}
