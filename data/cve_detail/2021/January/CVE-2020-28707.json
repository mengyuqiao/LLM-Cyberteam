{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-28707", "Description": "The Stockdio Historical Chart plugin before 2.8.1 for WordPress is affected by Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via stockdio_chart_historical-wp.js in wp-content/plugins/stockdio-historical-chart/assets/ because the origin of a postMessage() event is not validated. The stockdio_eventer function listens for any postMessage event. After a message event is sent to the application, this function sets the \"e\" variable as the event and checks that the types of the data and data.method are not undefined (empty) before proceeding to eval the data.method received from the postMessage. However, on a different website. JavaScript code can call window.open for the vulnerable WordPress instance and do a postMessage(msg,'*') for that object.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28707", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nStockdio\u00bbStockdio Historical Chart\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.8.1cpe:2.3:a:stockdio:stockdio_historical_chart:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-10-05  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-26  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jondow.eu/cve-2020-28707-xss-in-stockdio-historical-chart-plugin-for-wordpress-before-version-281/", "ref_desc": "jondow | CVE-2020-28707 \u2013 XSS in Stockdio Historical Chart plugin for WordPress before version 2.8.1Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://stockdio.com", "ref_desc": "Stockdio.com - From Zero to Financial Market Analytics in less than 60 seconds!Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/stockdio-historical-chart/#developers", "ref_desc": "Stockdio Historical Chart \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.orgRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
