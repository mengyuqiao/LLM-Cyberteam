{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22873", "Description": "Revive Adserver before 5.1.0 is vulnerable to open redirects via the `dest`, `oadest`, and/or `ct0` parameters of the lg.php and ck.php delivery scripts. Such open redirects had previously been available by design to allow third party ad servers to track such metrics when delivering ads. However, third party click tracking via redirects is not a viable option anymore, leading to such open redirect functionality being removed and reclassified as a vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22873", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nRevive-adserver\u00bbRevive AdserverVersions  before (<) 5.1.0cpe:2.3:a:revive-adserver:revive_adserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.95%  4.80%  +3.85 \n 2  2024-12-12  1.30%  0.95%  -0.35 \n 3  2024-05-26  0.92%  1.30%  +0.38 \n 4  2023-10-07  0.87%  0.92%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-08-28  0.72%  0.87%  +0.15 \n 6  2023-07-06  0.62%  0.72%  +0.10 \n 7  2023-03-07  42.47%  0.62%  -41.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1081406", "ref_desc": "#1081406 Open redirect in ck.php and lg.phpExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/161070/Revive-Adserver-5.0.5-Cross-Site-Scripting-Open-Redirect.html", "ref_desc": "Revive Adserver 5.0.5 Cross Site Scripting / Open Redirect \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8tJ45gBH0gLEk6nzKVgTiZaCyKw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2021-001/", "ref_desc": "Revive Adserver Security Advisory SA-2021-001Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kpwkN5dEwC08BdA8gBcwNigVn2Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Jan/60", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [REVIVE-SA-2021-001] Revive Adserver VulnerabilitiesBroken Link;Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s60_CUEPzVIwy9eXewz52bFWKNk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/issues/1068", "ref_desc": "open redirect (oadest url) ck.php revive 4.2.1 \u00b7 Issue #1068 \u00b7 revive-adserver/revive-adserver \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
