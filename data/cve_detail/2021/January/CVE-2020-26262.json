{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26262", "Description": "Coturn is free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Coturn before version 4.5.2 by default does not allow peers to connect and relay packets to loopback addresses in the range of `127.x.x.x`. However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then is able to relay packets to the loopback interface. Additionally, when coturn is listening on IPv6, which is default, the loopback interface can also be reached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address. By using the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will be able to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless `--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since the default configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. The issue patched in version 4.5.2. As a workaround the addresses in the address block `0.0.0.0/8`, `[::1]` and `[::]` should be denied by default unless `--allow-loopback-peers` has been specified.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26262", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCoturn Project\u00bbCoturnVersions  before (<) 4.5.2cpe:2.3:a:coturn_project:coturn:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.27%  +0.08 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-09-29  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-20  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.11%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-441 Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/441/Unintended-Proxy-or-Intermediary-Confused-Deputy-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/682/Incorrect-Calculation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M4CJOPAQT43MYAFU3UROGLEXN3Z6RS4H/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: coturn-4.5.2-1.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coturn/coturn/commit/abfe1fd08d78baa0947d17dac0f7411c3d948e4d", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'advisory-fix-1' CVE-2020-26262 \u00b7 coturn/coturn@abfe1fd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G54UIUFTEC6RLPOISMB6FUW7456SBZC4/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: coturn-4.5.2-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coturn/coturn/blob/57180ab60afcaeb13537e69ae8cb8aefd8f3f546/ChangeLog#L48", "ref_desc": "coturn/ChangeLog at 57180ab60afcaeb13537e69ae8cb8aefd8f3f546 \u00b7 coturn/coturn \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coturn/coturn/security/advisories/GHSA-6g6j-r9rf-cm7p", "ref_desc": "Loopback bypass by using 0.0.0.0, [::1] or [::] as the peer address \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 coturn/coturn \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vUbJd0ouGhhW3Y3gNkkMZznSsbE.html"}]}
