{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21237", "Description": "Git LFS is a command line extension for managing large files with Git. On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a git.bat or git.exe file in the current directory, that program would be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This does not affect Unix systems. This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-27955. This issue occurs because on Windows, Go includes (and prefers) the current directory when the name of a command run does not contain a directory separator. Other than avoiding untrusted repositories or using a different operating system, there is no workaround. This is fixed in v2.13.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21237", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGit Large File Storage Project\u00bbGit Large File StorageVersions  before (<) 2.13.2cpe:2.3:a:git_large_file_storage_project:git_large_file_storage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.37%  0.05%  -1.31 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v2.13.2", "ref_desc": "Release v2.13.2 \u00b7 git-lfs/git-lfs \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-27955", "ref_desc": "CVE - CVE-2020-27955Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/fc664697ed2c2081ee9633010de0a7f9debea72a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-cx3w-xqmc-84g5 \u00b7 git-lfs/git-lfs@fc66469 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/security/advisories/GHSA-cx3w-xqmc-84g5", "ref_desc": "Git LFS can execute a Git binary from the current directory on Windows \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 git-lfs/git-lfs \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
