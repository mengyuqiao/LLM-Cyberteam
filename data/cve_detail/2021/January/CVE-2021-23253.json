{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-23253", "Description": "Opera Mini for Android below 53.1 displays URL left-aligned in the address field. This allows a malicious attacker to craft a URL with a long domain name, e.g. www.safe.opera.com.attacker.com. With the URL being left-aligned, the user will only see the front part (e.g. www.safe.opera.com\u2026) The exact amount depends on the phone screen size but the attacker can craft a number of different domains and target different phones. Starting with version 53.1 Opera Mini displays long URLs with the top-level domain label aligned to the right of the address field which mitigates the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23253", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpera\u00bbOpera Mini\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 53.1cpe:2.3:a:opera:opera_mini:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.opera.com/address-bar-spoofing-in-opera-mini-opera-security-advisories/", "ref_desc": "Address bar spoofing in Opera Mini \u2013 Opera Security Advisories - Opera Security CornerVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
