{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35488", "Description": "The fileop module of the NXLog service in NXLog Community Edition 2.10.2150 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted Syslog payload to the Syslog service. This attack requires a specific configuration. Also, the name of the directory created must use a Syslog field. (For example, on Linux it is not possible to create a .. directory. On Windows, it is not possible to create a CON directory.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35488", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNxlog\u00bbNxlog\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  before (<) 3.0.2272cpe:2.3:a:nxlog:nxlog:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.45%  2.28%  -1.17 \n 2  2024-08-19  2.46%  3.45%  +0.99 \n 3  2024-06-27  2.19%  2.46%  +0.27 \n 4  2024-05-25  1.56%  2.19%  +0.63 \n 5  2024-04-23  1.48%  1.56%  +0.08 \n 6  2024-03-08  1.30%  1.48%  +0.18 \n 7  2024-02-08  1.18%  1.30%  +0.13 \n 8  2023-11-01  0.93%  1.18%  +0.25 \n 9  2023-09-21  0.75%  0.93%  +0.18 \n 10  2023-08-12  0.64%  0.75%  +0.11 \n 11  2023-03-07  12.94%  0.64%  -12.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/GuillaumePetit84/CVE-2020-35488", "ref_desc": "GitHub - GuillaumePetit84/CVE-2020-35488Exploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gitlab.com/nxlog-public/nxlog-ce/-/blob/master/ChangeLog.txt#L2", "ref_desc": "ChangeLog.txt \u00b7 master \u00b7 nxlog-public / nxlog-ce \u00b7 GitLabRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
