{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21469", "Description": "When security guidelines for SAP NetWeaver Master Data Management running on windows have not been thoroughly reviewed, it might be possible for an external operator to try and set custom paths in the MDS server configuration. When no adequate protection has been enforced on any level (e.g., MDS Server password not set, network and OS configuration not properly secured, etc.), a malicious user might define UNC paths which could then be exploited to put the system at risk using a so-called SMB relay attack and obtain highly sensitive data, which leads to Information Disclosure.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21469", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbNetweaver Master Data Management\u00bbVersion:7.10cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_master_data_management:7.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbNetweaver Master Data Management\u00bbVersion:7.10.750cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_master_data_management:7.10.750:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbNetweaver Master Data Management\u00bbVersion:710cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_master_data_management:710:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-28  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-08-19  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.18%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=564760476", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Patch Day \u2013 January 2021 - Product Security Response at SAP - Community WikiVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/okruwS-4u8I6X51n_-w7DlQCdBA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2993032", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
