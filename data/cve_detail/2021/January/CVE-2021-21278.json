In RSSHub before version 7f1c430 (non-semantic versioning) there is a risk of code injection. Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues The fix in version 7f1c430 is to temporarily remove the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21278", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRsshub\u00bbRsshub\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2021-01-25cpe:2.3:a:rsshub:rsshub:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.71%  0.58%  -0.14 \n 2  2024-11-30  0.73%  0.71%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-11-15  0.61%  0.73%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-07-01  0.43%  0.61%  +0.18 \n 5  2023-12-19  0.31%  0.43%  +0.13 \n 6  2023-10-12  0.22%  0.31%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-09-02  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-08-07  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.21%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commit/7f1c43094e8a82e4d8f036ff7d42568fed00699d", "ref_desc": "feat: remove some routes for security reasons, !!! no-eval no-new-fun\u2026 \u00b7 DIYgod/RSSHub@7f1c430 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsshub", "ref_desc": "rsshub - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/security/advisories/GHSA-pgjj-866w-fc5c", "ref_desc": "Risk of code injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DIYgod/RSSHub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
