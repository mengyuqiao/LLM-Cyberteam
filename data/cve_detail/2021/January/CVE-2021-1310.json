{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1310", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to an untrusted web page, bypassing the warning mechanism that should prompt the user before the redirection. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the URL parameters in an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious website, bypassing the Webex URL check that should result in a warning before the redirection to the web page. Attackers may use this type of vulnerability, known as an open redirect attack, as part of a phishing attack to convince users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1310", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex MeetingsVersions  before (<) 40.11.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-20  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-open-redirect-PWvBQ2q", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Meetings Open Redirect VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
