{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-36168", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Veritas Resiliency Platform 3.4 and 3.5. It leverages OpenSSL on Windows systems when using the Managed Host addon. On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library. This library may attempt to load the openssl.cnf configuration file, which does not exist. By default, on Windows systems, users can create directories under C:\\. A low privileged user can create a C:\\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications, etc.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36168", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVeritas\u00bbResiliency Platform\u00bbVersion:3.4cpe:2.3:a:veritas:resiliency_platform:3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVeritas\u00bbResiliency Platform\u00bbVersion:3.5cpe:2.3:a:veritas:resiliency_platform:3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-015", "ref_desc": "Veritas Resiliency Platform OpenSSL Advisory | Veritas\u2122Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
