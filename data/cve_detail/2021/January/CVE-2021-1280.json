{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1280", "Description": "A vulnerability in the loading mechanism of specific DLLs of Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints for Windows and Immunet for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid credentials on the Windows system. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory search paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file on the targeted system. This file will execute when the vulnerable application launches. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with SYSTEM privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1280", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdvanced Malware Protection For Endpoints\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 7.3.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:advanced_malware_protection_for_endpoints:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbImmunet\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 7.3.12cpe:2.3:a:cisco:immunet:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-amp-imm-dll-5PAZ3hRV", "ref_desc": "Cisco Advanced Malware Protection for Endpoints and Immunet for Windows DLL Hijacking VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
