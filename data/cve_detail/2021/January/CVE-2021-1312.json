{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1312", "Description": "A vulnerability in the system resource management of Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) to the health monitor API on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inadequate provisioning of kernel parameters for the maximum number of TCP connections and SYN backlog. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports that are used by the health monitor API. This vulnerability only affects customers who use the health monitor API.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1312", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbElastic Services ControllerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.3.0.94cpe:2.3:a:cisco:elastic_services_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-06  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-08-27  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esc-dos-4Gw6D527", "ref_desc": "Cisco Elastic Services Controller Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
