{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-3308", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1 through 4.14.x. An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter case, this would affect the entire host.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3308", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nXEN\u00bbXENVersions  from including (>=) 4.13.1andup to, including, (<=) 4.14.1cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXEN\u00bbXEN\u00bbVersion:4.12.3cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:4.12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXEN\u00bbXEN\u00bbVersion:4.12.4cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:4.12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:32cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S5C42TMQYB6SDVT2MPFEWY65A6RSUVBN/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 32 Update: xen-4.13.2-6.fc32 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-360.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-360 - Xen Security AdvisoriesPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-30", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202107-30) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UOh9rWWorJz0YZeHveEaWWYNUBI.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/26/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 360 v2 (CVE-2021-3308) - IRQ vector leak on x86Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
