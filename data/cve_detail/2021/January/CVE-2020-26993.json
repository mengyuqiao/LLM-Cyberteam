{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26993", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files. This could lead to a stack based buffer overflow while trying to copy to a buffer in the font index handling function. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26993", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbJt2goVersions  before (<) 13.1.0cpe:2.3:a:siemens:jt2go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSiemens\u00bbTeamcenter VisualizationVersions  before (<) 13.1.0cpe:2.3:a:siemens:teamcenter_visualization:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-19  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-08-19  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.06%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-622830.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2bpVBco1rwxjYqJGwoIB9cJfvew.html"}]}
