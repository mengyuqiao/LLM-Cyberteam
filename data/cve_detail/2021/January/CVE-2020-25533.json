{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-25533", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Malwarebytes before 4.0 on macOS. A malicious application was able to perform a privileged action within the Malwarebytes launch daemon. The privileged service improperly validated XPC connections by relying on the PID instead of the audit token. An attacker can construct a situation where the same PID is used for running two different programs at different times, by leveraging a race condition during crafted use of posix_spawn.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25533", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMalwarebytes\u00bbMalwarebytes\u00bbForMacosVersions  before (<) 4.0cpe:2.3:a:malwarebytes:malwarebytes:*:*:*:*:-:macos:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-05-20  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wojciechregula.blog/post/learn-xpc-exploitation-part-2-say-no-to-the-pid/", "ref_desc": "Learn XPC exploitation - Part 2: Say no to the PID!Exploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
