{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21242", "Description": "OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is a critical vulnerability which can lead to pre-auth remote code execution. AttachmentUploadServlet deserializes untrusted data from the `Attachment-Support` header. This Servlet does not enforce any authentication or authorization checks. This issue may lead to pre-auth remote code execution. This issue was fixed in 4.0.3 by removing AttachmentUploadServlet and not using deserialization", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21242", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOnedev Project\u00bbOnedevVersions  before (<) 4.0.3cpe:2.3:a:onedev_project:onedev:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "49.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  63.82%  49.10%  -14.72 \n 2  2024-11-04  65.71%  63.82%  -1.89 \n 3  2024-10-02  66.44%  65.71%  -0.73 \n 4  2024-08-29  64.26%  66.44%  +2.17 \n 5  2024-06-20  56.18%  64.26%  +8.08 \n 6  2024-05-20  63.71%  56.18%  -7.53 \n 7  2024-04-18  65.65%  63.71%  -1.94 \n 8  2024-03-18  62.24%  65.65%  +3.41 \n 9  2024-02-18  60.69%  62.24%  +1.55 \n 10  2024-01-19  64.39%  60.69%  -3.71 \n 11  2023-12-22  67.70%  64.39%  -3.31 \n 12  2023-10-01  70.66%  67.70%  -2.96 \n 13  2023-08-22  69.43%  70.66%  +1.23 \n 14  2023-07-14  70.66%  69.43%  -1.23 \n 15  2023-05-19  68.54%  70.66%  +2.13 \n 16  2023-03-11  72.37%  68.54%  -3.83 \n 17  2023-03-07  1.98%  72.37%  +70.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/f864053176c08f59ef2d97fea192ceca46a4d9be", "ref_desc": "Do not use deserialized AttachmentSupport from client side to avoid s\u2026 \u00b7 theonedev/onedev@f864053 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-5q3q-f373-2jv8", "ref_desc": "Pre-Auth Unsafe Deserialization on AttachmentUploadServet \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 theonedev/onedev \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
