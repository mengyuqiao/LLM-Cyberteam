{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21241", "Description": "The Python \"Flask-Security-Too\" package is used for adding security features to your Flask application. It is an is a independently maintained version of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. In Flask-Security-Too from version 3.3.0 and before version 3.4.5, the /login and /change endpoints can return the authenticated user's authentication token in response to a GET request. Since GET requests aren't protected with a CSRF token, this could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring the authentication token. Version 3.4.5 and version 4.0.0 are patched. As a workaround, if you aren't using authentication tokens - you can set the SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to \"0\" (seconds) which should make the token unusable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21241", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nFlask-security-too Project\u00bbFlask-security-tooVersions  from including (>=) 3.3.0andbefore (<) 3.4.5cpe:2.3:a:flask-security-too_project:flask-security-too:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-18  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-09-27  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 3  2023-07-23  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.09%  -1.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/pull/422", "ref_desc": "Fix security vuln - GET on /login or /change could reveal authenticat\u2026 by jwag956 \u00b7 Pull Request #422 \u00b7 Flask-Middleware/flask-security \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/commit/6d50ee9169acf813257c37b75babe9c28e83542a", "ref_desc": "Fix security vuln - GET on /login or /change could reveal authenticat\u2026 \u00b7 Flask-Middleware/flask-security@6d50ee9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/security/advisories/GHSA-hh7m-rx4f-4vpv", "ref_desc": "CSRF Vuln can expose users authentication token \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Flask-Middleware/flask-security \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/commit/61d313150b5f620d0b800896c4f2199005e84b1f", "ref_desc": "I421backport (#425) \u00b7 Flask-Middleware/flask-security@61d3131 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/releases/tag/3.4.5", "ref_desc": "Release Fix CSRF Vulnerability \u00b7 Flask-Middleware/flask-security \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Security-Too", "ref_desc": "Flask-Security-Too \u00b7 PyPIProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
