{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27220", "Description": "The Eclipse Hono AMQP and MQTT protocol adapters do not check whether an authenticated gateway device is authorized to receive command & control messages when it has subscribed only to commands for a specific device. The missing check involves verifying that the command target device is configured giving permission for the gateway device to act on its behalf. This means an authenticated device of a certain tenant, notably also a non-gateway device acting like a gateway, may receive command & control messages targeted at a different device of the same tenant without corresponding permissions getting checked.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27220", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbHonoVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.4.4cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:hono:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbHono\u00bbVersion:1.5.0cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:hono:1.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=569856", "ref_desc": "569856 \u2013 (CVE-2020-27220) Hono's AMQP/MQTT adapter doesn't check if device may subscribe for commands targeted at another deviceVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
