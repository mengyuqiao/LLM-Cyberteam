{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40222", "Description": "Rittal CMC PU III Web management Version affected: V3.11.00_2. Version fixed: V3.17.10 is affected by a remote code execution vulnerablity. It is possible to introduce shell code to create a reverse shell in the PU-Hostname field of the TCP/IP Configuration dialog. Web application fails to sanitize user input on Network TCP/IP configuration page. This allows the attacker to inject commands as root on the device which will be executed once the data is received.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40222", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nRittal\u00bbCmc Pu Iii 7030.000 FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 3.11.00_2andbefore (<) 3.17.10cpe:2.3:o:rittal:cmc_pu_iii_7030.000_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Rittal\u00bbCmc Pu Iii 7030.000\u00bbVersion:3.00", "EPSS Score": "0.42% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.42%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-02-22  0.32%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-02  0.32%  0.32%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-25  0.31%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-17  0.29%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-02  0.29%  0.29%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  15.36%  0.29%  -15.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/asang17/CVE-2021-RCE", "ref_desc": "GitHub - asang17/CVE-2021-RCE: Remote Code Execution at RittalExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
