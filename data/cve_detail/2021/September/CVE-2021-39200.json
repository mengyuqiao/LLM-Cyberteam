{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39200", "Description": "WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. In affected versions output data of the function wp_die() can be leaked under certain conditions, which can include data like nonces. It can then be used to perform actions on your behalf. This has been patched in WordPress 5.8.1, along with any older affected versions via minor releases. It's strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39200", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWordpress\u00bbWordpressVersions  from including (>=) 5.2andbefore (<) 5.8.1cpe:2.3:a:wordpress:wordpress:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.33%  +0.24 \n 2  2023-04-02  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/security/advisories/GHSA-m9hc-7v5q-x8q5", "ref_desc": "WordPress: Information Disclosure in wp_die() via JSONP, leading to CSRF \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 WordPress/wordpress-develop \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4985", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4985-1 wordpressThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/k1z7bKp5Wah87E2AAvJXmhyHItI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions RequiredCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/P6ZRxkRL-hZkBSKELqFFye4sBPI.html"}]}
