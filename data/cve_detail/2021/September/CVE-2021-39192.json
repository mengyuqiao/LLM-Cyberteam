{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39192", "Description": "Ghost is a Node.js content management system. An error in the implementation of the limits service between versions 4.0.0 and 4.9.4 allows all authenticated users (including contributors) to view admin-level API keys via the integrations API endpoint, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability. This issue is patched in Ghost version 4.10.0. As a workaround, disable all non-Administrator accounts to prevent API access. It is highly recommended to regenerate all API keys after patching or applying the workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39192", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGhost\u00bbGhost\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.10.0cpe:2.3:a:ghost:ghost:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-22  0.10%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-27  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/security/advisories/GHSA-j5c2-hm46-wp5c", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation: all users can access Admin-level API keys \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TryGhost/Ghost \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases/tag/v4.10.0", "ref_desc": "Release 4.10.0 \u00b7 TryGhost/Ghost \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
