{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32802", "Description": "Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted personal cloud. Nextcloud supports rendering image previews for user provided file content. For some image types, the Nextcloud server was invoking a third-party library that wasn't suited for untrusted user-supplied content. There are several security concerns with passing user-generated content to this library, such as Server-Side-Request-Forgery, file disclosure or potentially executing code on the system. The risk depends on your system configuration and the installed library version. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. These versions do not use this library anymore. As a workaround users may disable previews by setting `enable_previews` to `false` in `config.php`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32802", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 22.0.0andbefore (<) 22.1.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 20.0.12cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 21.0.0andbefore (<) 21.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.28%  0.38%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-05-23  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-13  0.25%  0.25%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-18  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-29  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-04-15  0.19%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-31  0.19%  0.19%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.19%  -0.83 \n 9  2023-02-22  15.35%  1.02%  -14.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/21/admin_manual/configuration_files/previews_configuration.html#disabling-previews", "ref_desc": "Previews configuration \u2014 Nextcloud latest Administration Manual latest documentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1261413", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-m682-v4g9-wrq7", "ref_desc": "Preview generation used third-party library not suited for user-generated content \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-17) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jZHo9JiHBzcYnpiDroWdMBiDUSQ.html"}]}
