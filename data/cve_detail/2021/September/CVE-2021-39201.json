{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39201", "Description": "WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. ### Impact The issue allows an authenticated but low-privileged user (like contributor/author) to execute XSS in the editor. This bypasses the restrictions imposed on users who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to older versions via minor releases (automatic updates). It's strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### References https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/ https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/wordpress)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39201", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWordpress\u00bbWordpressVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.8cpe:2.3:a:wordpress:wordpress:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-04-02  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/security/advisories/GHSA-wh69-25hr-h94v", "ref_desc": "Authenticated cross-site scripting (XSS) in WordPress editor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 WordPress/wordpress-develop \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4985", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4985-1 wordpressThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/k1z7bKp5Wah87E2AAvJXmhyHItI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions RequiredCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/P6ZRxkRL-hZkBSKELqFFye4sBPI.html"}]}
