{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32782", "Description": "Nextcloud Circles is an open source social network built for the nextcloud ecosystem. In affected versions the Nextcloud Circles application is vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Circles application is upgraded to 0.21.3, 0.20.10 or 0.19.14 to resolve this issue. As a workaround users may use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy. A notable exemption is Internet Explorer which does not support CSP properly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32782", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbCirclesVersions  from including (>=) 0.20.0andbefore (<) 0.20.10cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:circles:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbCirclesVersions  before (<) 0.19.14cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:circles:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbCirclesVersions  from including (>=) 0.21.0andbefore (<) 0.21.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:circles:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1217606", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/circles/commit/dbb97a83ccb342c839a54f088aa19b8ba6844b0e", "ref_desc": "escapeHTML when browsing shared files \u00b7 nextcloud/circles@dbb97a8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-hgpq-28gj-jrj9", "ref_desc": "XSS in Nextcloud Circles \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
