{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-37631", "Description": "Deck is an open source kanban style organization tool aimed at personal planning and project organization for teams integrated with Nextcloud. In affected versions the Deck application didn't properly check membership of users in a Circle. This allowed other users in the instance to gain access to boards that have been shared with a Circle, even if the user was not a member of the circle. It is recommended that Nextcloud Deck is upgraded to 1.5.1, 1.4.4 or 1.2.9. If you are unable to update it is advised to disable the Deck plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37631", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbDeckVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 1.5.1cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:deck:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbDeckVersions  before (<) 1.2.9cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:deck:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbDeckVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0andbefore (<) 1.4.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:deck:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-03-31  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-4mxp-j277-82hr", "ref_desc": "Deck shared with a Circle can be accessed by non-Circle members \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1280931", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1256021", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/deck/pull/3217", "ref_desc": "Move circle checks to a unified service and improve member checks by juliushaertl \u00b7 Pull Request #3217 \u00b7 nextcloud/deck \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
