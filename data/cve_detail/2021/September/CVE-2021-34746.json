{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34746", "Description": "A vulnerability in the TACACS+ authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) feature of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and log in to an affected device as an administrator. This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of user-supplied input that is passed to an authentication script. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting parameters into an authentication request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and log in as an administrator to the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34746", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Nfv Infrastructure SoftwareVersions  before (<) 4.6.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_nfv_infrastructure_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.88%  0.38%  -0.51 \n 2  2024-06-12  0.95%  0.88%  -0.07 \n 3  2024-05-17  0.86%  0.95%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.88%  0.86%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-11-24  0.82%  0.88%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-08-17  0.58%  0.82%  +0.24 \n 7  2023-04-09  0.41%  0.58%  +0.17 \n 8  2023-03-25  0.52%  0.41%  -0.10 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.52%  -0.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-289 Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/289/Authentication-Bypass-by-Alternate-Name.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nfvis-g2DMVVh", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-gqx8-c4xr-c664", "ref_desc": "Cisco ENCS - Authentication Bypass (CVE-2021-34746) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 orangecertcc/security-research \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
