{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32839", "Description": "sqlparse is a non-validating SQL parser module for Python. In sqlparse versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 there is a regular Expression Denial of Service in sqlparse vulnerability. The regular expression may cause exponential backtracking on strings containing many repetitions of '\\r\\n' in SQL comments. Only the formatting feature that removes comments from SQL statements is affected by this regular expression. As a workaround don't use the sqlformat.format function with keyword strip_comments=True or the --strip-comments command line flag when using the sqlformat command line tool. The issues has been fixed in sqlparse 0.4.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32839", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSqlparse Project\u00bbSqlparseVersions  from including (>=) 0.4.0andbefore (<) 0.4.2cpe:2.3:a:sqlparse_project:sqlparse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-05  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-26  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-13  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/8238a9e450ed1524e40cb3a8b0b3c00606903aeb", "ref_desc": "Optimize regular expression for identifying line breaks in comments. \u00b7 andialbrecht/sqlparse@8238a9e \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories/GHSA-p5w8-wqhj-9hhf", "ref_desc": "StripComments filter contains a regular expression that is vulnerable to ReDOS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 andialbrecht/sqlparse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
