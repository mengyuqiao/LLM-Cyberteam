{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41101", "Description": "wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. Before version 2.106.0, the CORS ` Access-Control-Allow-Origin ` header set by `nginz` is set for all subdomains of `.wire.com` (including `wire.com`). This means that if somebody were to find an XSS vector in any of the subdomains, they could use it to talk to the Wire API using the user's Cookie. A patch does not exist, but a workaround does. To make sure that a compromise of one subdomain does not yield access to the cookie of another, one may limit the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to apps that actually require the cookie (account-pages, team-settings and the webapp).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41101", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nWire\u00bbWire ServerVersions  before (<) 2.106.0cpe:2.3:a:wire:wire_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-04-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-13  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/security/advisories/GHSA-v7xx-cx8m-g66p", "ref_desc": "CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` settings are too lenient \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wireapp/wire-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
