{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28701", "Description": "Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28701", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXEN\u00bbXENVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.05%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CEHZLIR5DFYYQBH55AERWHLO54OFU42C/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: xen-4.14.2-4.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-384.txt", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3HEHUIUWSSMCQGQY3GWX4J2SZGYP5W2Z/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: xen-4.15.0-7.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23", "ref_desc": "Xen: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-23) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8nq3bhrOFCdJ_sZAElOOX_nOUoc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L4MI3MQAPGILCLXBGQWPZHGE3ALSO4ZU/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: xen-4.14.2-4.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4977", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4977-1 xenThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MVRPNx4SoEN5Aig_4ZO3QdhnBig.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/08/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 384 v3 (CVE-2021-28701) - Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handlingMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-384.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-384 - Xen Security AdvisoriesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
