{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39162", "Description": "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, can abnormally terminate if an H/2 GOAWAY and SETTINGS frame are received in the same IO event. This can lead to a DoS in the presence of untrusted *upstream* servers. 0.15.1 contains an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched. If only trusted upstreams are configured, there is not substantial risk of this condition being triggered.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39162", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.18.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoy\u00bbVersion:1.19.0cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:1.19.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPomerium\u00bbPomerium\u00bbVersion:0.15.0cpe:2.3:a:pomerium:pomerium:0.15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-05-25  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-15  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-20  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-05-01  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-02  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/security/advisories/GHSA-gjcg-vrxg-xmgv", "ref_desc": "Incorrect handling of H2 GOAWAY + SETTINGS frames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pomerium/pomerium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/envoy-announce/c/5xBpsEZZDfE/m/wD05NZBbAgAJ", "ref_desc": "Security releases of Envoy 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, and 1.16.5 are now availableNot Applicable;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CuixvTAGB4QCW8drd5ip1qZnT6Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-j374-mjrw-vvp8", "ref_desc": "Incorrect handling of H/2 GOAWAY followed by SETTINGS frames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hzk5gC40-NtkxEXzoeWWLHH76l0.html"}]}
