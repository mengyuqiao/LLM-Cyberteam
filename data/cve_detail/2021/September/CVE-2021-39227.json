{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39227", "Description": "ZRender is a lightweight graphic library providing 2d draw for Apache ECharts. In versions prior to 5.2.1, using `merge` and `clone` helper methods in the `src/core/util.ts` module results in prototype pollution. It affects the popular data visualization library Apache ECharts, which uses and exports these two methods directly. The GitHub Security Advisory page for this vulnerability contains a proof of concept. This issue is patched in ZRender version 5.2.1. One workaround is available: Check if there is `__proto__` in the object keys. Omit it before using it as an parameter in these affected methods. Or in `echarts.util.merge` and `setOption` if project is using ECharts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39227", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBaidu\u00bbZrenderVersions  before (<) 5.2.1cpe:2.3:a:baidu:zrender:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.34%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-06-02  0.22%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-23  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-28  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-09  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-25  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-04-10  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.18%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender/security/advisories/GHSA-fhv8-fx5f-7fxf", "ref_desc": "Prototype Pollution in zrender \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ecomfe/zrender \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender/releases/tag/5.2.1", "ref_desc": "Release 5.2.1 \u00b7 ecomfe/zrender \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender/pull/826", "ref_desc": "fix prototype pollution in merge, clone, extend utilities by pissang \u00b7 Pull Request #826 \u00b7 ecomfe/zrender \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
