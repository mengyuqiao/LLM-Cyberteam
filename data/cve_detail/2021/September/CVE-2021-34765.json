{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34765", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web UI for Cisco Nexus Insights could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view and download files related to the web application. The attacker requires valid device credentials. This vulnerability exists because proper role-based access control (RBAC) filters are not applied to file download actions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the application and then navigating to the directory listing and download functions. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download sensitive files that should be restricted, which could result in disclosure of sensitive information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34765", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbNexus InsightsVersions  before (<) 6.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:nexus_insights:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-552 Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/552/Files-or-Directories-Accessible-to-External-Parties.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-insight-infodis-2By2ZpBB", "ref_desc": "Cisco Nexus Insights Authenticated Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
