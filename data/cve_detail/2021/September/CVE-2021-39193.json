{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39193", "Description": "Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints. A patch is available in commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26. There are no workarounds aside from applying the patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39193", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nParity\u00bbFrontierVersions  before (<) 2021-09-03cpe:2.3:a:parity:frontier:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-05-19  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-09  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-14  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-27  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/465", "ref_desc": "Validate transaction cost by tgmichel \u00b7 Pull Request #465 \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/security/advisories/GHSA-hw4v-5x4h-c3xm", "ref_desc": "Transaction validity oversight in pallet-ethereum \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/465/commits/8a2b890a2fb477d5fedd0e4335b00623832849ae", "ref_desc": "Validate transaction cost by tgmichel \u00b7 Pull Request #465 \u00b7 paritytech/frontier \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/commit/0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26", "ref_desc": "Add transaction cost pre-validation (#465) \u00b7 paritytech/frontier@0b962f2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
