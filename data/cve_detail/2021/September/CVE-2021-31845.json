{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-31845", "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in McAfee Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Discover prior to 11.6.100 allows an attacker in the same network as the DLP Discover to execute arbitrary code through placing carefully constructed Ami Pro (.sam) files onto a machine and having DLP Discover scan it, leading to remote code execution with elevated privileges. This is caused by the destination buffer being of fixed size and incorrect checks being made on the source size.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31845", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMcafee\u00bbData Loss Prevention DiscoverVersions  from including (>=) 11.7.0andbefore (<) 11.7.100cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_discover:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMcafee\u00bbData Loss Prevention DiscoverVersions  before (<) 11.6.100cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_discover:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-01  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-10  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-02  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-04-10  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.06%  -1.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10368", "ref_desc": "Security Bulletin - Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Endpoint Windows and DLP Discover updates fix two vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31844, CVE-2021-31845)Broken LinkCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/d6KuRemLpv9Lm6nEhLFUqd6nfvw.html"}]}
