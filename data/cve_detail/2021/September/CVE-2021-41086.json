{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41086", "Description": "jsuites is an open source collection of common required javascript web components. In affected versions users are subject to cross site scripting (XSS) attacks via clipboard content. jsuites is vulnerable to DOM based XSS if the user can be tricked into copying _anything_ from a malicious and pasting it into the html editor. This is because a part of the clipboard content is directly written to `innerHTML` allowing for javascript injection and thus XSS. Users are advised to update to version 4.9.11 to resolve.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41086", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nJsuites\u00bbJsuitesVersions  before (<) 4.9.11cpe:2.3:a:jsuites:jsuites:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-08  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jsuites/jsuites/security/advisories/GHSA-qh7x-j4v8-qw5w", "ref_desc": "Clipboard-based XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jsuites/jsuites \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jsuites/jsuites/commit/d47a6f4e143188dde2742f4cffd313e1068ad3b3", "ref_desc": "Editor sanitize parser updates. \u00b7 jsuites/jsuites@d47a6f4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jsuites/jsuites/commit/fe1d3cc5e339f2f4da8ed1f9f42271fdf9cbd8d2", "ref_desc": "Editor sec fix, toolbar reponsiveness tracking fix, responsive \u00b7 jsuites/jsuites@fe1d3cc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
