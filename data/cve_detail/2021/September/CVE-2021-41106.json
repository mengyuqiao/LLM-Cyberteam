{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41106", "Description": "JWT is a library to work with JSON Web Token and JSON Web Signature. Prior to versions 3.4.6, 4.0.4, and 4.1.5, users of HMAC-based algorithms (HS256, HS384, and HS512) combined with `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\LocalFileReference` as key are having their tokens issued/validated using the file path as hashing key - instead of the contents. The HMAC hashing functions take any string as input and, since users can issue and validate tokens, users are lead to believe that everything works properly. Versions 3.4.6, 4.0.4, and 4.1.5 have been patched to always load the file contents, deprecated the `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\LocalFileReference`, and suggest `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\InMemory` as the alternative. As a workaround, use `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\InMemory` instead of `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\LocalFileReference` to create the instances of one's keys.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41106", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJwt Project\u00bbJWTVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.0.4cpe:2.3:a:jwt_project:jwt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJwt Project\u00bbJWTVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.1.5cpe:2.3:a:jwt_project:jwt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJwt Project\u00bbJWTVersions  from including (>=) 3.4.0andbefore (<) 3.4.6cpe:2.3:a:jwt_project:jwt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-7322-jrq4-x5hf", "ref_desc": "File reference keys leads to incorrect hashes on HMAC algorithms \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 lcobucci/jwt \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt/commit/8175de5b841fbe3fd97d2d49b3fc15c4ecb39a73", "ref_desc": "Ensure key contents is used for all hashing algorithms \u00b7 lcobucci/jwt@8175de5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt/commit/c45bb8b961a8e742d8f6b88ef5ff1bd5cca5d01c", "ref_desc": "Ensure key contents is used for all hashing algorithms \u00b7 lcobucci/jwt@c45bb8b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
