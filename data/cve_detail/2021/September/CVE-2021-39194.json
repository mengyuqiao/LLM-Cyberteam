{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39194", "Description": "kaml is an open source implementation of the YAML format with support for kotlinx.serialization. In affected versions attackers that could provide arbitrary YAML input to an application that uses kaml could cause the application to endlessly loop while parsing the input. This could result in resource starvation and denial of service. This only affects applications that use polymorphic serialization with the default tagged polymorphism style. Applications using the property polymorphism style are not affected. YAML input for a polymorphic type that provided a tag but no value for the object would trigger the issue. Version 0.35.3 or later contain the fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39194", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nKaml Project\u00bbKamlVersions  before (<) 0.35.3cpe:2.3:a:kaml_project:kaml:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-11-30  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-04-29  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/charleskorn/kaml/issues/179", "ref_desc": "Polymorphic serialization hangs \u00b7 Issue #179 \u00b7 charleskorn/kaml \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/charleskorn/kaml/security/advisories/GHSA-fmm9-3gv8-58f4", "ref_desc": "Potential denial of service while parsing polymorphic input with tagged polymorphism style \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 charleskorn/kaml \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/charleskorn/kaml/commit/e18785d043fc6324c81e968aae9764b4b060bc6a", "ref_desc": "Fix issue where decoding a polymorphic type that uses the tag polymor\u2026 \u00b7 charleskorn/kaml@e18785d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
