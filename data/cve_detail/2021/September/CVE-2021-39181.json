{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39181", "Description": "OpenOlat is a web-based learning management system (LMS). Prior to version 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0, using a prepared import XML file (e.g. a course) any class on the Java classpath can be instantiated, including spring AOP bean factories. This can be used to execute code arbitrary code by the attacker. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account with the authoring role. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39181", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFrentix\u00bbOpenolatVersions  from including (>=) 15.5.0andbefore (<) 15.5.3cpe:2.3:a:frentix:openolat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrentix\u00bbOpenolatVersions  before (<) 15.3.18cpe:2.3:a:frentix:openolat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-02-28  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-22  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-23  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-04-09  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-25  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.15%  -2.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-91 XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/91/XML-Injection-aka-Blind-XPath-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/security/advisories/GHSA-596v-3gwh-2m9w", "ref_desc": "Unsafe Deserialization of User Data Using XStream \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.openolat.org/browse/OO-5548", "ref_desc": "Log in - OpenOlat Issue ManagementPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/commit/3f219ac457afde82e3be57bc614352ab92c05684", "ref_desc": "OO-5548: setup security of XStream by default \u00b7 OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT@3f219ac \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
