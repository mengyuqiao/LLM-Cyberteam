{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39199", "Description": "remark-html is an open source nodejs library which compiles Markdown to HTML. In affected versions the documentation of remark-html has mentioned that it was safe by default. In practice the default was never safe and had to be opted into. That is, user input was not sanitized. This means arbitrary HTML can be passed through leading to potential XSS attacks. The problem has been patched in 13.0.2 and 14.0.1: `remark-html` is now safe by default, and the implementation matches the documentation. On older affected versions, pass `sanitize: true` if you cannot update.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39199", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRemark\u00bbRemark-html\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 13.0.2cpe:2.3:a:remark:remark-html:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nRemark\u00bbRemark-html\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 14.0.0andbefore (<) 14.0.1cpe:2.3:a:remark:remark-html:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-23  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-13  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-31  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html/commit/b75c9dde582ad87ba498e369c033dc8a350478c1", "ref_desc": "Fix to sanitize by default \u00b7 remarkjs/remark-html@b75c9dd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html/releases/tag/14.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release 14.0.1 \u00b7 remarkjs/remark-html \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-html", "ref_desc": "remark-html - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html/security/advisories/GHSA-9q5w-79cv-947m", "ref_desc": "Unsafe defaults in `remark-html` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 remarkjs/remark-html \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
