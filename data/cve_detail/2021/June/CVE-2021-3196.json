{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-3196", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Hitachi ID Bravura Security Fabric 11.0.0 through 11.1.3, 12.0.0 through 12.0.2, and 12.1.0. When using federated identity management (authenticating via SAML through a third-party identity provider), an attacker can inject additional data into a signed SAML response being transmitted to the service provider (ID Bravura Security Fabric). The application successfully validates the signed values but uses the unsigned malicious values. An attacker with lower-privilege access to the application can inject the username of a high-privilege user to impersonate that user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3196", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHitachi\u00bbId Bravura Security FabricVersions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 11.1.3cpe:2.3:a:hitachi:id_bravura_security_fabric:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHitachi\u00bbId Bravura Security FabricVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.0.2cpe:2.3:a:hitachi:id_bravura_security_fabric:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHitachi\u00bbId Bravura Security Fabric\u00bbVersion:12.1.0cpe:2.3:a:hitachi:id_bravura_security_fabric:12.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.68% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.61%  0.68%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-10-12  0.57%  0.61%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-07-12  0.40%  0.57%  +0.17 \n 4  2024-06-12  0.28%  0.40%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-05-01  0.29%  0.28%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-09-01  0.24%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.hitachi.com/hirt/security/index.html", "ref_desc": "Security Information : Hitachi Incident Response Team : HitachiVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1cR_gOwYvc4lyWhiJlGj2vAMccg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.hitachi.com/hirt/hitachi-sec/2021/601.html", "ref_desc": "hitachi-sec-2021-601XML Signature Wrapping Attack (XSW) issue in Hitachi ID Bravura Security Fabric : Hitachi Incident Response Team : HitachiExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.hitachi-id.com/cve-2021-3196-attackers-can-impersonate-another-user", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability Alert | CVE-2021-3196 Attackers Can Impersonate Another UserVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
