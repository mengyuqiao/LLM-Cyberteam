{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32659", "Description": "Matrix-appservice-bridge is the bridging service for the Matrix communication program's application services. In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32659", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbMatrix-appservice-bridge\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix-appservice-bridge:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/security/advisories/GHSA-35g4-qx3c-vjhx", "ref_desc": "Automatic room upgrade handling can be used maliciously to bridge a room non-consentually \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/commit/b69e745584a34fcfd858df33e4631e420da07b9f", "ref_desc": "Check m.room.create event on room upgrade \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge@b69e745 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/2.6.1", "ref_desc": "Release 2.6.1 (2021-06-02) \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
