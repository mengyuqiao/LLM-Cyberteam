{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21279", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things devices. In verions prior to 4.6, an attacker can perform a denial-of-service attack by triggering an infinite loop in the processing of IPv6 neighbor solicitation (NS) messages. This type of attack can effectively shut down the operation of the system because of the cooperative scheduling used for the main parts of Contiki-NG and its communication stack. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6. Users can apply the patch for this vulnerability out-of-band as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21279", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  before (<) 4.6cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-03-03  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-23  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-rr5j-j8m8-fc4f", "ref_desc": "Infinite loop in IPv6 neighbor solicitation processing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
