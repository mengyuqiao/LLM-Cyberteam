{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32496", "Description": "SICK Visionary-S CX up version 5.21.2.29154R are vulnerable to an Inadequate Encryption Strength vulnerability concerning the internal SSH interface solely used by SICK for recovering returned devices. The use of weak ciphers make it easier for an attacker to break the security that protects information transmitted from the client to the SSH server, assuming the attacker has access to the network on which the device is connected. This can increase the risk that encryption will be compromised, leading to the exposure of sensitive user information and man-in-the-middle attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32496", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSick\u00bbVisionary-s Cx FirmwareVersions  before (<) 5.21.2.29154rcpe:2.3:o:sick:visionary-s_cx_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Sick\u00bbVisionary-s Cx\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.sick.com/de/en/service-and-support/the-sick-product-security-incident-response-team-sick-psirt/w/psirt/#advisories", "ref_desc": "The SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT) | SICKVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/n8CqJxhP55uNJsxtCfd1B7ak4Ww.html"}]}
