{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21422", "Description": "mongo-express is a web-based MongoDB admin interface, written with Node.js and express. 1: As mentioned in this issue: https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/issues/577, when the content of a cell grows larger than supported size, clicking on a row will show full document unescaped, however this needs admin interaction on cell. 2: Data cells identified as media will be rendered as media, without being sanitized. Example of different renders: image, audio, video, etc. As an example of type 1 attack, an unauthorized user who only can send a large amount of data in a field of a document may use a payload with embedded javascript. This could send an export of a collection to the attacker without even an admin knowing. Other types of attacks such as dropping a database\\collection are possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21422", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMongo-express Project\u00bbMongo-express\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.54.0cpe:2.3:a:mongo-express_project:mongo-express:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nMongo-express Project\u00bbMongo-express\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateAlpha1cpe:2.3:a:mongo-express_project:mongo-express:1.0.0:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMongo-express Project\u00bbMongo-express\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateAlpha3cpe:2.3:a:mongo-express_project:mongo-express:1.0.0:alpha3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2024-03-06  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/security/advisories/GHSA-7p8h-86p5-wv3p", "ref_desc": "Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mongo-express/mongo-express \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/commit/f5e0d4931f856f032f22664b5e5901d5950cfd4b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7p8h-86p5-wv3p \u00b7 mongo-express/mongo-express@f5e0d49 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/issues/577", "ref_desc": "HTML in String fields is not escaped if only preview is loaded \u00b7 Issue #577 \u00b7 mongo-express/mongo-express \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
