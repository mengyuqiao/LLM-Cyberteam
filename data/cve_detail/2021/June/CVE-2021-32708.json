{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32708", "Description": "Flysystem is an open source file storage library for PHP. The whitespace normalisation using in 1.x and 2.x removes any unicode whitespace. Under certain specific conditions this could potentially allow a malicious user to execute code remotely. The conditions are: A user is allowed to supply the path or filename of an uploaded file, the supplied path or filename is not checked against unicode chars, the supplied pathname checked against an extension deny-list, not an allow-list, the supplied path or filename contains a unicode whitespace char in the extension, the uploaded file is stored in a directory that allows PHP code to be executed. Given these conditions are met a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the system under attack. The unicode whitespace removal has been replaced with a rejection (exception). For 1.x users, upgrade to 1.1.4. For 2.x users, upgrade to 2.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32708", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nThephpleague\u00bbFlysystemVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.1.1cpe:2.3:a:thephpleague:flysystem:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nThephpleague\u00bbFlysystemVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.1.4cpe:2.3:a:thephpleague:flysystem:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.90% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.71%  0.90%  +0.19 \n 2  2024-03-09  0.66%  0.71%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-01-29  0.67%  0.66%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-01-03  0.57%  0.67%  +0.10 \n 5  2023-12-21  0.57%  0.57%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-11-08  0.51%  0.57%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-03-14  0.50%  0.51%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  2.76%  0.50%  -2.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/commit/f3ad69181b8afed2c9edf7be5a2918144ff4ea32", "ref_desc": "Reject paths with funky whitespace. \u00b7 thephpleague/flysystem@f3ad691 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NWPTENBYKI2IG47GI4DHAACLNRLTWUR5/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: php-league-flysystem-1.1.4-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/security/advisories/GHSA-9f46-5r25-5wfm", "ref_desc": "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition in league/flysystem \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 thephpleague/flysystem \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/commit/a3c694de9f7e844b76f9d1b61296ebf6e8d89d74", "ref_desc": "Reject funky whitspace paths. \u00b7 thephpleague/flysystem@a3c694d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/league/flysystem", "ref_desc": "league/flysystem - PackagistProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RNZSWK4GOMJOOHKLZEOE5AQSLC4DNCRZ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: php-league-flysystem-1.1.4-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
