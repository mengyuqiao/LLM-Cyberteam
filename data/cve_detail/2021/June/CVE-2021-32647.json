{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32647", "Description": "Emissary is a P2P based data-driven workflow engine. Affected versions of Emissary are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE). The [`CreatePlace`](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/blob/30c54ef16c6eb6ed09604a929939fb9f66868382/src/main/java/emissary/server/mvc/internal/CreatePlaceAction.java#L36) REST endpoint accepts an `sppClassName` parameter which is used to load an arbitrary class. This class is later instantiated using a constructor with the following signature: `<constructor>(String, String, String)`. An attacker may find a gadget (class) in the application classpath that could be used to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or disrupt the application. Even though the chances to find a gadget (class) that allow arbitrary code execution are low, an attacker can still find gadgets that could potentially crash the application or leak sensitive data. As a work around disable network access to Emissary from untrusted sources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32647", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNSA\u00bbEmissary\u00bbVersion:6.4.0cpe:2.3:a:nsa:emissary:6.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.40%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-30  0.39%  0.39%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-07-29  0.27%  0.39%  +0.12 \n 4  2023-11-10  0.26%  0.27%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-13  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.25%  -1.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-470 Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/470/Use-of-Externally-Controlled-Input-to-Select-Classes-or-Code.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/security/advisories/GHSA-ph73-7v9r-wg32", "ref_desc": "Post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) in emissary:emissary \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NationalSecurityAgency/emissary \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/blob/30c54ef16c6eb6ed09604a929939fb9f66868382/src/main/java/emissary/server/mvc/internal/CreatePlaceAction.java#L36", "ref_desc": "emissary/CreatePlaceAction.java at 30c54ef16c6eb6ed09604a929939fb9f66868382 \u00b7 NationalSecurityAgency/emissary \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
