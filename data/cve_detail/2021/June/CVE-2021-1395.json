{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1395", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1395", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Intelligence CenterVersions  up to, including, (<=) 12.0\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:unified_intelligence_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Intelligence Center\u00bbVersion:12.5(1)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:unified_intelligence_center:12.5\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbPackaged Contact Center Enterprise\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:cisco:packaged_contact_center_enterprise:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Contact Center Enterprise\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:cisco:unified_contact_center_enterprise:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Contact Center ExpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 12.5\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:o:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-19  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-03-01  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-21  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.14%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cuic-xss-csHUdtrL", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Intelligence Center Reflected Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
