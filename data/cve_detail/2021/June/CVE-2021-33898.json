{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33898", "Description": "In Invoice Ninja before 4.4.0, there is an unsafe call to unserialize() in app/Ninja/Repositories/AccountRepository.php that may allow an attacker to deserialize arbitrary PHP classes. In certain contexts, this can result in remote code execution. The attacker's input must be hosted at http://www.geoplugin.net (cleartext HTTP), and thus a successful attack requires spoofing that site or obtaining control of it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33898", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nInvoiceninja\u00bbInvoice NinjaVersions  before (<) 4.4.0cpe:2.3:a:invoiceninja:invoice_ninja:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.84%  1.12%  +0.29 \n 2  2024-05-12  0.79%  0.84%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-02-20  0.74%  0.79%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-01-11  0.55%  0.74%  +0.19 \n 5  2023-11-19  0.53%  0.55%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-29  0.51%  0.53%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-05-22  0.49%  0.51%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.49%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/issues/5909", "ref_desc": "Insecure deserialization versions <= 4.3.1 \u00b7 Issue #5909 \u00b7 invoiceninja/invoiceninja \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
