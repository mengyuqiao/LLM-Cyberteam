{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32719", "Description": "RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging broker. In rabbitmq-server prior to version 3.8.18, when a federation link was displayed in the RabbitMQ management UI via the `rabbitmq_federation_management` plugin, its consumer tag was rendered without proper <script> tag sanitization. This potentially allows for JavaScript code execution in the context of the page. The user must be signed in and have elevated permissions (manage federation upstreams and policies) for this to occur. The vulnerability is patched in RabbitMQ 3.8.18. As a workaround, disable the `rabbitmq_federation_management` plugin and use [CLI tools](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html) instead.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32719", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbRabbitmqVersions  before (<) 3.8.18cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.23%  +0.14 \n 2  2023-03-18  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.09%  -2.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://herolab.usd.de/security-advisories/usd-2021-0011/", "ref_desc": "usd-2021-0011 | usd HerolabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3122", "ref_desc": "Escape the consumer-tag value in federation mgmt by dentarg \u00b7 Pull Request #3122 \u00b7 rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/security/advisories/GHSA-5452-hxj4-773x", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) in RabbitMQ federation management plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
