{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24037", "Description": "A use after free in hermes, while emitting certain error messages, prior to commit d86e185e485b6330216dee8e854455c694e3a36e allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24037", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermesVersions  before (<) 0.8.0cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.36%  0.34%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-11-02  0.37%  0.36%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-10-18  0.36%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-21  0.34%  0.36%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-29  0.32%  0.34%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-01-20  0.31%  0.32%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.31%  -1.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/CVE-2021-24037", "ref_desc": "FacebookVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/d86e185e485b6330216dee8e854455c694e3a36e", "ref_desc": "Fix a bug in transient object property assignment and getUTF16Ref \u00b7 facebook/hermes@d86e185 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
