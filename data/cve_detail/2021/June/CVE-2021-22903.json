{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22903", "Description": "The actionpack ruby gem before 6.1.3.2 suffers from a possible open redirect vulnerability. Specially crafted Host headers in combination with certain \"allowed host\" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. This is similar to CVE-2021-22881. Strings in config.hosts that do not have a leading dot are converted to regular expressions without proper escaping. This causes, for example, `config.hosts << \"sub.example.com\"` to permit a request with a Host header value of `sub-example.com`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22903", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nRubyonrails\u00bbRailsVersions  from including (>=) 6.1.1andbefore (<) 6.1.3.2cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRubyonrails\u00bbRails\u00bbVersion:6.1.0UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:6.1.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-02-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-16  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1148025", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2021-22903-possible-open-redirect-vulnerability-in-action-pack/77867", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2021-22903] Possible Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack - Security Announcements - Ruby on Rails DiscussionsMitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
