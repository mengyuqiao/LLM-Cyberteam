{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33541", "Description": "Phoenix Contact Classic Line Controllers ILC1x0 and ILC1x1 in all versions/variants are affected by a Denial-of-Service vulnerability. The communication protocols and device access do not feature authentication measures. Remote attackers can use specially crafted IP packets to cause a denial of service on the PLC's network communication module. A successful attack stops all network communication. To restore the network connectivity the device needs to be restarted. The automation task is not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33541", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPhoenixcontact\u00bbIlc1x0 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:phoenixcontact:ilc1x0_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Phoenixcontact\u00bbIlc1x0\u00bbVersion:N/A\nPhoenixcontact\u00bbIlc1x1 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:phoenixcontact:ilc1x1_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Phoenixcontact\u00bbIlc1x1\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-03-08  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-01-30  0.19%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.19%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2021-019", "ref_desc": "PHOENIX CONTACT : Security Advisory for ILC1x1 Industrial controllers \u2014 English (USA)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
