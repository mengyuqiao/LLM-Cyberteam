{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25641", "Description": "Each Apache Dubbo server will set a serialization id to tell the clients which serialization protocol it is working on. But for Dubbo versions before 2.7.8 or 2.6.9, an attacker can choose which serialization id the Provider will use by tampering with the byte preamble flags, aka, not following the server's instruction. This means that if a weak deserializer such as the Kryo and FST are somehow in code scope (e.g. if Kryo is somehow a part of a dependency), a remote unauthenticated attacker can tell the Provider to use the weak deserializer, and then proceed to exploit it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25641", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbDubboVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.6.9cpe:2.3:a:apache:dubbo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbDubboVersions  from including (>=) 2.7.0andbefore (<) 2.7.8cpe:2.3:a:apache:dubbo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.90% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  7.76%  2.90%  -4.86 \n 2  2024-06-15  8.48%  7.76%  -0.72 \n 3  2024-04-20  15.28%  8.48%  -6.80 \n 4  2024-02-12  18.21%  15.28%  -2.93 \n 5  2024-01-03  23.39%  18.21%  -5.18 \n 6  2023-08-21  25.86%  23.39%  -2.47 \n 7  2023-05-14  25.26%  25.86%  +0.60 \n 8  2023-03-18  31.91%  25.26%  -6.65 \n 9  2023-03-07  9.03%  31.91%  +22.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r99ef7fa35585d3a68762de07e8d2b2bc48b8fa669a03e8d84b9673f3%40%3Cdev.dubbo.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2021-25641] Potential deserialization id tampering from network - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
