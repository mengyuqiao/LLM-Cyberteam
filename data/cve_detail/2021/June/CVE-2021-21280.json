{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21280", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things devices. It is possible to cause an out-of-bounds write in versions of Contiki-NG prior to 4.6 when transmitting a 6LoWPAN packet with a chain of extension headers. Unfortunately, the written header is not checked to be within the available space, thereby making it possible to write outside the buffer. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6. Users can apply the patch for this vulnerability out-of-band as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21280", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  before (<) 4.6cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.42%  0.32%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.35%  0.42%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-05-10  0.25%  0.35%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-03-03  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-23  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-r768-hrhf-v592", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds write when processing 6LoWPAN extension headers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1409", "ref_desc": "Prevent out-of-bounds write when processing external headers in sicslowpan by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #1409 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
