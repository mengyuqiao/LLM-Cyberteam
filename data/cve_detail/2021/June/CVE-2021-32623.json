{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32623", "Description": "Opencast is a free and open source solution for automated video capture and distribution. Versions of Opencast prior to 9.6 are vulnerable to the billion laughs attack, which allows an attacker to easily execute a (seemingly permanent) denial of service attack, essentially taking down Opencast using a single HTTP request. To exploit this, users need to have ingest privileges, limiting the group of potential attackers The problem has been fixed in Opencast 9.6. There is no known workaround for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32623", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nApereo\u00bbOpencastVersions  before (<) 9.6cpe:2.3:a:apereo:opencast:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-776 Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/776/Improper-Restriction-of-Recursive-Entity-References-in-DTDs-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/8ae27da5a6f658011a5741b3210e715b0dc6213e", "ref_desc": "Clarifies debug options in setenv file (#2735) \u00b7 opencast/opencast@8ae27da \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-9gwx-9cwp-5c2m", "ref_desc": "Opencast vulnerable to billion laughs attack (XML bomb) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencast/opencast \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
