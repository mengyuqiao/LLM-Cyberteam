{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33031", "Description": "In LabCup before <v2_next_18022, it is possible to use the save API to perform unauthorized actions for users without access to user management in order to, after successful exploitation, gain access to a victim's account. A user without the user-management privilege can change another user's email address if the attacker knows details of the victim such as the exact roles and group roles, ID, and remote authentication ID settings. These must be sent in a modified save API request. It was fixed in 6.3.0.03.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33031", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLabcup\u00bbLabcupVersions  before (<) v2_next_18022cpe:2.3:a:labcup:labcup:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-09-14  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Accenture/AARO-Bugs/blob/master/AARO-CVE-List.md", "ref_desc": "AARO-Bugs/AARO-CVE-List.md at master \u00b7 Accenture/AARO-Bugs \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Dmfjp8RMZTlEGhHqVzm6dRA2Ysg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://labcup.net/privacy-data-security/", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
