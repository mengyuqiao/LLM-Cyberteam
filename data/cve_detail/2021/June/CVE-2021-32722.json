{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32722", "Description": "GlobalNewFiles is a mediawiki extension. Versions prior to 48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d are affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. A large amount of page moves within a short space of time could overwhelm Database servers due to improper handling of load balancing and a lack of an appropriate index. As a workaround, one may avoid use of the extension unless additional rate limit at the MediaWiki level or via PoolCounter / MySQL is enabled. A patch is available in version 48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32722", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMiraheze\u00bbGlobalnewfiles\u00bbForMediawikicpe:2.3:a:miraheze:globalnewfiles:*:*:*:*:*:mediawiki:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.14%  -0.06 \n 2  2024-02-29  0.14%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/GlobalNewFiles/pull/17", "ref_desc": "Use PageMoveComplete hook by Universal-Omega \u00b7 Pull Request #17 \u00b7 miraheze/GlobalNewFiles \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://phabricator.miraheze.org/T7532", "ref_desc": "\u2693 T7532 GlobalNewFiles disabled as caused too many connections to db11 (CVE-2021-32722)Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/GlobalNewFiles/commit/48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d", "ref_desc": "Use PageMoveComplete hook (#17) \u00b7 miraheze/GlobalNewFiles@48be7ad \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miraheze/GlobalNewFiles/security/advisories/GHSA-cwv5-c938-5h5h", "ref_desc": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in GlobalNewFiles \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 miraheze/GlobalNewFiles \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
