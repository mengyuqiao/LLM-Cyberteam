{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21257", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things devices. The RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite implementations in the Contiki-NG operating system versions prior to 4.6 do not validate the address pointer in the RPL source routing header This makes it possible for an attacker to cause out-of-bounds writes with packets injected into the network stack. Specifically, the problem lies in the rpl_ext_header_srh_update function in the two rpl-ext-header.c modules for RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite respectively. The addr_ptr variable is calculated using an unvalidated CMPR field value from the source routing header. An out-of-bounds write can be triggered on line 151 in os/net/routing/rpl-lite/rpl-ext-header.c and line 261 in os/net/routing/rpl-classic/rpl-ext-header.c, which contain the following memcpy call with addr_ptr as destination. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6. Users can apply a patch out-of-band as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21257", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  before (<) 4.6cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-03  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-23  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-mvc7-9p4q-c5cm", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds write in RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1431", "ref_desc": "Validate the address pointer in the source routing header by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #1431 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
