{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29481", "Description": "Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior to 1.9.0, the default configuration of client side sessions results in unencrypted, but signed, data being set as cookie values. This means that if something sensitive goes into the session, it could be read by something with access to the cookies. For this to be a vulnerability, some kind of sensitive data would need to be stored in the session and the session cookie would have to leak. For example, the cookies are not configured with httpOnly and an adjacent XSS vulnerability within the site allowed capture of the cookies. As of version 1.9.0, a securely randomly generated signing key is used. As a workaround, one may supply an encryption key, as per the documentation recommendation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29481", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRatpack Project\u00bbRatpackVersions  before (<) 1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:ratpack_project:ratpack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-14  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-03  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/pull/1590", "ref_desc": "Use random UUID for default client side session encryption secret by ldaley \u00b7 Pull Request #1590 \u00b7 ratpack/ratpack \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/security/advisories/GHSA-phj8-4cq3-794g", "ref_desc": "Client side sessions should not allow unencrypted storage \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ratpack/ratpack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
