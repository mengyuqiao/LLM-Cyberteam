{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32662", "Description": "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals, and techdocs-common contains common functionalities for Backstage's TechDocs. In `@backstage/techdocs-common` versions prior to 0.6.3, a malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be available over the TechDocs backend API. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to modify the `mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would also need access to the TechDocs backend API. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32662", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbBackstageVersions  before (<) 0.6.3cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:backstage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-pgf8-28gg-vpr6", "ref_desc": "TechDocs mkdocs.yml path traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/8cefadca04cbf01d0394b0cb1983247e5f1d6208", "ref_desc": "Add validation to prevent docs_dir from being an absolute path \u00b7 backstage/backstage@8cefadc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/release-2021-05-27", "ref_desc": "Release release-2021-05-27 \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
