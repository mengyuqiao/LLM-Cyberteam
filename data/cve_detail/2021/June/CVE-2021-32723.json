{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32723", "Description": "Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or ERB to highlight untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32723", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOracle\u00bbApplication ExpressVersions  before (<) 21.1.4cpe:2.3:a:oracle:application_express:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPrismjs\u00bbPrism\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.24.0cpe:2.3:a:prismjs:prism:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-03-13  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-02  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-01-07  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.11%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2774", "ref_desc": "Updated refa + fixed 2 cases of exponential backtracking by RunDevelopment \u00b7 Pull Request #2774 \u00b7 PrismJS/prism \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DdEXkXwhusNG2Ywp50abCVReuBM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2688", "ref_desc": "Tests: Exhaustive pattern tests by RunDevelopment \u00b7 Pull Request #2688 \u00b7 PrismJS/prism \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg", "ref_desc": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Prism \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrismJS/prism \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
