{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-26707", "Description": "The merge-deep library before 3.0.3 for Node.js can be tricked into overwriting properties of Object.prototype or adding new properties to it. These properties are then inherited by every object in the program, thus facilitating prototype-pollution attacks against applications using this library.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26707", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetapp\u00bbE-series Performance Analyzer\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:e-series_performance_analyzer:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMerge-deep Project\u00bbMerge-deep\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.0.3cpe:2.3:a:merge-deep_project:merge-deep:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.63%  0.61%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.57%  0.63%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-01-07  0.57%  0.57%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-12  0.55%  0.57%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.55%  -0.47 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210716-0008/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-26707 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jonschlinkert/merge-deep/commit/11e5dd56de8a6aed0b1ed022089dbce6968d82a5", "ref_desc": "add isValidKey function to ensure only valid keys are merged \u00b7 jonschlinkert/merge-deep@11e5dd5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/merge-deep", "ref_desc": "merge-deep - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2020-160-merge-deep/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2020-160: Prototype pollution in Merge-deep | GitHub Security LabThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
