{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32720", "Description": "Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is to decorate the `\\Sylius\\Bundle\\ApiBundle\\Doctrine\\QueryCollectionExtension\\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Exception\\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for unauthorized user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32720", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSylius\u00bbSyliusVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.0andbefore (<) 1.9.5cpe:2.3:a:sylius:sylius:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-02  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.9.5", "ref_desc": "Release v1.9.5 \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/security/advisories/GHSA-rpxh-vg2x-526v", "ref_desc": "List of order ids, number, items total and token value exposed for unauthorized uses via new API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sylius/Sylius \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
