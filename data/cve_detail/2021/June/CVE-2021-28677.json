{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28677", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For EPS data, the readline implementation used in EPSImageFile has to deal with any combination of \\r and \\n as line endings. It used an accidentally quadratic method of accumulating lines while looking for a line ending. A malicious EPS file could use this to perform a DoS of Pillow in the open phase, before an image was accepted for opening.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28677", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPython\u00bbPillowVersions  before (<) 8.2.0cpe:2.3:a:python:pillow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.22%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-01-07  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-12  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.12%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/07/msg00018.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2716-1] pillow security updateThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4iPqfVbxWvaMO4OV941-RjLHfAA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/8.2.0.html#cve-2021-28677-fix-eps-dos-on-open", "ref_desc": "8.2.0 \u2014 Pillow (PIL Fork) 8.2.0 documentationThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/5377", "ref_desc": "Security fixes for 8.2.0 by hugovk \u00b7 Pull Request #5377 \u00b7 python-pillow/Pillow \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Re_S1hIp6dg3UUV8g5dM1Y5W-L4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MQHA5HAIBOYI3R6HDWCLAGFTIQP767FL/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: mingw-python-pillow-7.2.0-6.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v8tOzxB5HjtGTBfd6LATaB4sl_g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-33", "ref_desc": "Pillow: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 202107-33) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vimQGyiGjUm9cmiWZIR07UQ3jmM.html"}]}
