{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32700", "Description": "Ballerina is an open source programming language and platform for cloud application programmers. Ballerina versions 1.2.x and SL releases up to alpha 3 have a potential for a supply chain attack via MiTM against users. Http connections did not make use of TLS and certificate checking was ignored. The vulnerability allows an attacker to substitute or modify packages retrieved from BC thus allowing to inject malicious code into ballerina executables. This has been patched in Ballerina 1.2.14 and Ballerina SwanLake alpha4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32700", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBallerina\u00bbBallerinaVersions  before (<) 1.2.14cpe:2.3:a:ballerina:ballerina:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBallerina\u00bbSwan Lake\u00bbVersion:Alpha1cpe:2.3:a:ballerina:swan_lake:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBallerina\u00bbSwan Lake\u00bbVersion:Alpha2cpe:2.3:a:ballerina:swan_lake:alpha2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBallerina\u00bbSwan Lake\u00bbVersion:Alpha3cpe:2.3:a:ballerina:swan_lake:alpha3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-07  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2024-01-27  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/commit/4609ffee1744ecd16aac09303b1783bf0a525816", "ref_desc": "Fix central connection \u00b7 ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang@4609ffe \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/security/advisories/GHSA-f5qg-fqrw-v5ww", "ref_desc": "Potential for a supply chain attack via MiTM against users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
