{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32661", "Description": "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. In versions of Backstage's Techdocs Plugin (`@backstage/plugin-techdocs`) prior to 0.9.5, a malicious internal actor can potentially upload documentation content with malicious scripts by embedding the script within an `object` element. This may give access to sensitive data when other users visit that same documentation page. The ability to upload malicious content may be limited by internal code review processes, unless the chosen TechDocs deployment method is to use an object store and the actor has access to upload files directly to that store. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.9.5` release of `@backstage/plugin-techdocs`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32661", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bb@backstage/plugin-techdocs\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.9.5cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:\\@backstage\\/plugin-techdocs:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-17  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-gg96-f8wr-p89f", "ref_desc": "TechDocs object element script injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/release-2021-06-03", "ref_desc": "Release release-2021-06-03 \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eRdPvq71XIf4C5fGerhZEHSynzA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/aad98c544e59369901fe9e0a85f6357644dceb5c", "ref_desc": "Initial changeset. \u00b7 backstage/backstage@aad98c5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Rna9geQsIbsUgo5KkL5BOSM8V8A.html"}]}
