{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1564", "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Cisco Discovery Protocol and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP packets at ingress time. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol or LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to continuously consume memory, which could cause the device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP are Layer 2 protocols. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1564", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbVideo Surveillance 7530pd FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.12.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:video_surveillance_7530pd_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVideo Surveillance 7530pd\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbVideo Surveillance 7070 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.12.3cpe:2.3:o:cisco:video_surveillance_7070_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbVideo Surveillance 7070\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipcamera-lldpcdp-mem-yTQDmjRO", "ref_desc": "Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras Cisco Discovery and Link Layer Discovery Protocol Memory Leak VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NbdShdRHrIexghfrZoTjwxBD9vQ.html"}]}
