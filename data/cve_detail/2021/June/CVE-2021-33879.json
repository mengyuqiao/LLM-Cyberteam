{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33879", "Description": "Tencent GameLoop before 4.1.21.90 downloaded updates over an insecure HTTP connection. A malicious attacker in an MITM position could spoof the contents of an XML document describing an update package, replacing a download URL with one pointing to an arbitrary Windows executable. Because the only integrity check would be a comparison of the downloaded file's MD5 checksum to the one contained within the XML document, the downloaded executable would then be executed on the victim's machine.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33879", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTencent\u00bbGameloopVersions  before (<) 4.1.21.90cpe:2.3:a:tencent:gameloop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.31%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-10-09  0.23%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-17  0.19%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-02-20  0.20%  0.19%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-01-11  0.20%  0.20%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.20%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-494 Download of Code Without Integrity Check", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/494/Download-of-Code-Without-Integrity-Check.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.gameloop.com", "ref_desc": "Download and Play Hot Mobile Games on PC for Free on GameLoopVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mmiszczyk/cve-2021-33879", "ref_desc": "GitHub - mmiszczyk/cve-2021-33879: GameLoop update MITMExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
