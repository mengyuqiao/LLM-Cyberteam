{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32033", "Description": "Protectimus SLIM NFC 70 10.01 devices allow a Time Traveler attack in which attackers can predict TOTP passwords in certain situations. The time value used by the device can be set independently from the used seed value for generating time-based one-time passwords, without authentication. Thus, an attacker with short-time physical access to a device can set the internal real-time clock (RTC) to the future, generate one-time passwords, and reset the clock to the current time. This allows the generation of valid future time-based one-time passwords without having further access to the hardware token.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32033", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nProtectimus\u00bbSlim Nfc 70 Firmware\u00bbVersion:10.01cpe:2.3:o:protectimus:slim_nfc_70_firmware:10.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Protectimus\u00bbSlim Nfc 70\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.05%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-10-19  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-01  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-335 Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/335/Incorrect-Usage-of-Seeds-in-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2021-007.txt", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163223/Protectimus-SLIM-NFC-Time-Manipulation.html", "ref_desc": "Protectimus SLIM NFC Time Manipulation \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry;Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Jun/39", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2021-007]: Protectimus SLIM NFC - External Control of System or Configuration Setting (CWE-15) (CVE-2021-32033)Mailing List;Third Party Advisory;Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
