{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-31615", "Description": "Unencrypted Bluetooth Low Energy baseband links in Bluetooth Core Specifications 4.0 through 5.2 may permit an adjacent device to inject a crafted packet during the receive window of the listening device before the transmitting device initiates its packet transmission to achieve full MITM status without terminating the link. When applied against devices establishing or using encrypted links, crafted packets may be used to terminate an existing link, but will not compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the link.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31615", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBluetooth\u00bbBluetooth Core SpecificationVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.2cpe:2.3:a:bluetooth:bluetooth_core_specification:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/injectable/", "ref_desc": "Security Notice | Bluetooth\u00ae Technology WebsiteVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bluetooth.com", "ref_desc": "Bluetooth\u00ae Technology WebsiteVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KXAs2tHNNKpXtt00fxlBmrJ03Sg.html"}]}
