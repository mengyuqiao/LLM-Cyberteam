{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32685", "Description": "tEnvoy contains the PGP, NaCl, and PBKDF2 in node.js and the browser (hashing, random, encryption, decryption, signatures, conversions), used by TogaTech.org. In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32685", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTogatech\u00bbTenvoy\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 7.0.3cpe:2.3:a:togatech:tenvoy:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.29%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-03-01  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-01-20  0.19%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-25  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.18%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TogaTech/tEnvoy/security/advisories/GHSA-7r96-8g3x-g36m", "ref_desc": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in tenvoy \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TogaTech/tEnvoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TogaTech/tEnvoy/releases/tag/v7.0.3", "ref_desc": "Release Critical Security Fix in verifyWithMessage \u00b7 TogaTech/tEnvoy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory;Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TogaTech/tEnvoy/commit/a121b34a45e289d775c62e58841522891dee686b", "ref_desc": "Critical security fix in verifyWithMessage \u00b7 TogaTech/tEnvoy@a121b34 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
