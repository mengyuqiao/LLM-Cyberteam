{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29620", "Description": "Report portal is an open source reporting and analysis framework. Starting from version 3.1.0 of the service-api XML parsing was introduced. Unfortunately the XML parser was not configured properly to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user to import a specifically-crafted XML file which imports external Document Type Definition (DTD) file with external entities for extraction of secrets from Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery. This will be resolved in the 5.4.0 release.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29620", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection;Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nReportportal\u00bbService-apiVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.0andbefore (<) 5.4.0cpe:2.3:a:reportportal:service-api:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.19%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-03-08  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-28  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-01-02  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.epam.reportportal/service-api", "ref_desc": "Maven Repository: com.epam.reportportal \u00bb service-apiRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/security/advisories/GHSA-24wf-7vf2-pv59", "ref_desc": "XXE vulnerability on Launch import with externally-defined DTD file \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 reportportal/reportportal \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/reportportal/service-api/pull/1392", "ref_desc": "EPMRPP-62610 || Sax parser fix by Yumfriez \u00b7 Pull Request #1392 \u00b7 reportportal/service-api \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
