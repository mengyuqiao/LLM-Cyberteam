{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32699", "Description": "Wings is the control plane software for the open source Pterodactyl game management system. All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the issue. There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32699", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPterodactyl\u00bbWingsVersions  before (<) 1.4.4cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-jj6m-r8jc-2gp7", "ref_desc": "Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification) in Docker containers created by Wings \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/e0078eee0a71d61573a94c75e6efcad069d78de3", "ref_desc": "[security] enforce process limits at a per-container level to avoid a\u2026 \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings@e0078ee \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
