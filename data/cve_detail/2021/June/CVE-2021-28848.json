{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28848", "Description": "Mintty before 3.4.5 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (Windows GUI hang) by telling the Mintty window to change its title repeatedly at high speed, which results in many SetWindowTextA or SetWindowTextW calls. In other words, it does not implement a usleep or similar delay upon processing a title change.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28848", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMintty Project\u00bbMinttyVersions  before (<) 3.4.5cpe:2.3:a:mintty_project:mintty:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-17  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-01-08  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-13  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mintty.github.io/", "ref_desc": "Mintty \u2014 Cygwin Terminal emulatorVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mintty/mintty/commit/bd52109993440b6996760aaccb66e68e782762b9", "ref_desc": "tame some window operations, just in case \u00b7 mintty/mintty@bd52109 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mintty/mintty/compare/3.4.4...3.4.5", "ref_desc": "Comparing 3.4.4...3.4.5 \u00b7 mintty/mintty \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
