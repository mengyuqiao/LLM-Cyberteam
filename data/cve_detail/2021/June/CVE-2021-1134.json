{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1134", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) integration feature of the Cisco DNA Center Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. The vulnerability is due to an incomplete validation of the X.509 certificate used when establishing a connection between DNA Center and an ISE server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted certificate and could then intercept communications between the ISE and DNA Center. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and alter sensitive information that the ISE maintains about clients that are connected to the network.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1134", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbDna CenterVersions  before (<) 2.2.2.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:dna_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-19  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-01  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-09-20  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-06-13  0.18%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.18%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dnac-certvalid-USEj2CZk", "ref_desc": "Cisco DNA Center Certificate Validation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
