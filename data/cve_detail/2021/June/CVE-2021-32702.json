{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32702", "Description": "The Auth0 Next.js SDK is a library for implementing user authentication in Next.js applications. Versions before and including `1.4.1` are vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by providing an XSS payload in the `error` query parameter which is then processed by the callback handler as an error message. You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` version `1.4.1` or lower **unless** you are using custom error handling that does not return the error message in an HTML response. Upgrade to version `1.4.1` to resolve. The fix adds basic HTML escaping to the error message and it should not impact your users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32702", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAuth0\u00bbNextjs-auth0\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.4.2cpe:2.3:a:auth0:nextjs-auth0:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-31  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-10  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-30  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-22  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-03-15  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.13%  -2.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/commit/6996e2528ceed98627caa28abafbc09e90163ccf", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-954c-jjx6-cxv7 \u00b7 auth0/nextjs-auth0@6996e25 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@auth0/nextjs-auth0", "ref_desc": "@auth0/nextjs-auth0 - npmProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-954c-jjx6-cxv7", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS from the callback handler's error query parameter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 auth0/nextjs-auth0 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
