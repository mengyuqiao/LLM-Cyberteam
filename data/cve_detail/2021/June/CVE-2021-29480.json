{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29480", "Description": "Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior to 1.9.0, the client side session module uses the application startup time as the signing key by default. This means that if an attacker can determine this time, and if encryption is not also used (which is recommended, but is not on by default), the session data could be tampered with by someone with the ability to write cookies. The default configuration is unsuitable for production use as an application restart renders all sessions invalid and is not multi-host compatible, but its use is not actively prevented. As of Ratpack 1.9.0, the default value is a securely randomly generated value, generated at application startup time. As a workaround, supply an alternative signing key, as per the documentation's recommendation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29480", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRatpack Project\u00bbRatpackVersions  before (<) 1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:ratpack_project:ratpack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-340 Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/340/Generation-of-Predictable-Numbers-or-Identifiers.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/blob/29434f7ac6fd4b36a4495429b70f4c8163100332/ratpack-session/src/main/java/ratpack/session/clientside/ClientSideSessionConfig.java#L29", "ref_desc": "ratpack/ClientSideSessionConfig.java at 29434f7ac6fd4b36a4495429b70f4c8163100332 \u00b7 ratpack/ratpack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/security/advisories/GHSA-2cc5-23r7-vc4v", "ref_desc": "Default client side session signing key is highly predictable \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ratpack/ratpack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
