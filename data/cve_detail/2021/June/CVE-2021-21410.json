{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21410", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read can be triggered by 6LoWPAN packets sent to devices running Contiki-NG 4.6 and prior. The IPv6 header decompression function (<code>uncompress_hdr_iphc</code>) does not perform proper boundary checks when reading from the packet buffer. Hence, it is possible to construct a compressed 6LoWPAN packet that will read more bytes than what is available from the packet buffer. As of time of publication, there is not a release with a patch available. Users can apply the patch for this vulnerability out-of-band as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21410", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.6cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-03  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-01-23  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1482", "ref_desc": "Added buffer boundary checks for 6LoWPAN decompression by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #1482 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-hhwj-2p59-v8p9", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read in the 6LoWPAN implementation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
