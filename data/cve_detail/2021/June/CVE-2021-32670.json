{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32670", "Description": "Datasette is an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data. The `?_trace=1` debugging feature in Datasette does not correctly escape generated HTML, resulting in a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks) vulnerability. This vulnerability is particularly relevant if your Datasette installation includes authenticated features using plugins such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords) as an attacker could use the vulnerability to access protected data. Datasette 0.57 and 0.56.1 both include patches for this issue. If you run Datasette behind a proxy you can workaround this issue by rejecting any incoming requests with `?_trace=` or `&_trace=` in their query string parameters.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32670", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDatasette\u00bbDatasetteVersions  before (<) 0.56.1cpe:2.3:a:datasette:datasette:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-02-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/datasette/", "ref_desc": "datasette \u00b7 PyPIRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks", "ref_desc": "Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Software Attack | OWASP FoundationThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1360", "ref_desc": "Security flaw, to be fixed in 0.56.1 and 0.57 \u00b7 Issue #1360 \u00b7 simonw/datasette \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-xw7c-jx9m-xh5g", "ref_desc": "Reflected cross-site scripting issue in Datasette \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 simonw/datasette \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords", "ref_desc": "datasette-auth-passwords - a plugin for DatasetteVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
