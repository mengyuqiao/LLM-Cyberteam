{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1527", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Player for Windows and MacOS could allow an attacker to cause the affected software to terminate or to gain access to memory state information that is related to the vulnerable application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of values in Webex recording files that are stored in Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious WRF file to a user as a link or email attachment and then persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the affected software and view memory state information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1527", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Player\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 41.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_player:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbWebex Player\u00bbForMacosVersions  before (<) 41.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_player:*:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-player-kxtkFbnR", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Player Memory Corruption VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
