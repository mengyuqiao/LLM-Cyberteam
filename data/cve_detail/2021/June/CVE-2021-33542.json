{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33542", "Description": "Phoenix Contact Classic Automation Worx Software Suite in Version 1.87 and below is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability. Manipulated PC Worx or Config+ projects could lead to a remote code execution when unallocated memory is freed because of incompletely initialized data. The attacker needs to get access to an original bus configuration file (*.bcp) to be able to manipulate data inside. After manipulation the attacker needs to exchange the original file by the manipulated one on the application programming workstation. Availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an application programming workstation might be compromised by attacks using these vulnerabilities. Automated systems in operation which were programmed with one of the above-mentioned products are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33542", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nPhoenixcontact\u00bbPc Worx ExpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.87cpe:2.3:a:phoenixcontact:pc_worx_express:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPhoenixcontact\u00bbConfig+Versions  up to, including, (<=) 1.87cpe:2.3:a:phoenixcontact:config\\+:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPhoenixcontact\u00bbPc WorxVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.87cpe:2.3:a:phoenixcontact:pc_worx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.28%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-07-10  0.25%  0.21%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-03-08  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-30  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-12-08  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-25  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 7  2023-10-27  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-06-10  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-05-25  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-12  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.61%  0.15%  -1.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/824/Access-of-Uninitialized-Pointer.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2021-020", "ref_desc": "PHOENIX CONTACT : Security Advisory for Automation Worx Software Suite \u2014 English (USA)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-782/", "ref_desc": "ZDI-21-782 | Zero Day InitiativeThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
