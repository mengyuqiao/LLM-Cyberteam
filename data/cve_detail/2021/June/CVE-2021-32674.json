{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32674", "Description": "Zope is an open-source web application server. This advisory extends the previous advisory at https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36 with additional cases of TAL expression traversal vulnerabilities. Most Python modules are not available for using in TAL expressions that you can add through-the-web, for example in Zope Page Templates. This restriction avoids file system access, for example via the 'os' module. But some of the untrusted modules are available indirectly through Python modules that are available for direct use. By default, you need to have the Manager role to add or edit Zope Page Templates through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope Page Templates through the web are at risk. The problem has been fixed in Zope 5.2.1 and 4.6.1. The workaround is the same as for https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36: A site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web should be restricted to trusted users only.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32674", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  before (<) 4.6.1cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.2.1cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.41%  0.14%  -0.27 \n 2  2024-02-09  0.20%  0.41%  +0.21 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.20%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/commit/1d897910139e2c0b11984fc9b78c1da1365bec21", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-rpcg-f9q6-2mq6 \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope@1d89791 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/Zope/", "ref_desc": "Zope \u00b7 PyPIProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-rpcg-f9q6-2mq6", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via traversal in TAL expressions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via traversal in TAL expressions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vP5fUkqg1uub4tRpKJcKCyodF68.html"}]}
