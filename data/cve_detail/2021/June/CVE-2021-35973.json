{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-35973", "Description": "NETGEAR WAC104 devices before 1.0.4.15 are affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability in /usr/sbin/mini_httpd, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to invoke any action by adding the &currentsetting.htm substring to the HTTP query, a related issue to CVE-2020-27866. This directly allows the attacker to change the web UI password, and eventually to enable debug mode (telnetd) and gain a shell on the device as the admin limited-user account (however, escalation to root is simple because of weak permissions on the /etc/ directory).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35973", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetgear\u00bbWac104 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.4.15cpe:2.3:o:netgear:wac104_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Netgear\u00bbWac104\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.61%  +0.23 \n 2  2024-11-02  0.36%  0.39%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-22  0.26%  0.36%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-04-10  0.28%  0.26%  -0.02 \n 5  2024-03-15  0.26%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-02-04  0.26%  0.26%  0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.26%  -0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/697/Incorrect-Comparison.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kb.netgear.com/000063785/Security-Advisory-for-Authentication-Bypass-on-WAC104-PSV-2021-0075", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory for Authentication Bypass on WAC104, PSV-2021-0075 | Answer | NETGEAR SupportVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&id=736", "ref_desc": "Gears of Chaos vulnerability chain (NETGEAR WAC104 access point) - gynvael.coldwind//vx.logExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
