{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32682", "Description": "elFinder is an open-source file manager for web, written in JavaScript using jQuery UI. Several vulnerabilities affect elFinder 2.1.58. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and commands on the server hosting the elFinder PHP connector, even with minimal configuration. The issues were patched in version 2.1.59. As a workaround, ensure the connector is not exposed without authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32682", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nStd42\u00bbElfinderVersions  before (<) 2.1.59cpe:2.3:a:std42:elfinder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  97.37%  97.04%  -0.33 \n 2  2024-12-04  97.36%  97.37%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-11-01  97.34%  97.36%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-09-30  97.30%  97.34%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-08-31  97.29%  97.30%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-07-31  97.30%  97.29%  -0.01 \n 7  2024-07-01  97.31%  97.30%  -0.01 \n 8  2024-03-25  97.29%  97.31%  +0.02 \n 9  2024-02-28  97.26%  97.29%  +0.04 \n 10  2024-02-15  97.28%  97.26%  -0.03 \n 11  2024-01-19  97.21%  97.28%  +0.08 \n 12  2023-12-24  97.20%  97.21%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-12-11  97.19%  97.20%  +0.01 \n 14  2023-11-27  97.24%  97.19%  -0.05 \n 15  2023-11-14  97.28%  97.24%  -0.04 \n 16  2023-10-16  96.73%  97.28%  +0.55 \n 17  2023-09-18  96.72%  96.73%  +0.01 \n 18  2023-09-06  96.68%  96.72%  +0.04 \n 19  2023-08-22  96.86%  96.68%  -0.18 \n 20  2023-08-08  96.88%  96.86%  -0.02 \n 21  2023-07-11  96.91%  96.88%  -0.03 \n 22  2023-06-28  96.70%  96.91%  +0.21 \n 23  2023-06-11  96.59%  96.70%  +0.11 \n 24  2023-05-30  96.46%  96.59%  +0.12 \n 25  2023-05-08  96.68%  96.46%  -0.22 \n 26  2023-05-01  97.22%  96.68%  -0.54 \n 27  2023-04-17  97.24%  97.22%  -0.02 \n 28  2023-04-03  97.25%  97.24%  -0.01 \n 29  2023-03-07  49.42%  97.25%  +47.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/commit/a106c350b7dfe666a81d6b576816db9fe0899b17", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wph3-44rj-92pr \u00b7 Studio-42/elFinder@a106c35 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164173/elFinder-Archive-Command-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "elFinder Archive Command Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/elfinder-case-study-of-web-file-manager-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "elFinder - A Case Study of Web File Manager VulnerabilitiesExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rQsbLxu29v083NIoZkBcVzTYSA4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/security/advisories/GHSA-wph3-44rj-92pr", "ref_desc": "Multiple vulnerabilities leading to RCE \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Studio-42/elFinder \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
