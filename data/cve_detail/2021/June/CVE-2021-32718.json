{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32718", "Description": "RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging broker. In rabbitmq-server prior to version 3.8.17, a new user being added via management UI could lead to the user's bane being rendered in a confirmation message without proper `<script>` tag sanitization, potentially allowing for JavaScript code execution in the context of the page. In order for this to occur, the user must be signed in and have elevated permissions (other user management). The vulnerability is patched in RabbitMQ 3.8.17. As a workaround, disable `rabbitmq_management` plugin and use CLI tools for management operations and Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and monitoring.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32718", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbRabbitmqVersions  before (<) 3.8.17cpe:2.3:a:vmware:rabbitmq:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.23%  +0.14 \n 2  2023-03-18  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.09%  -2.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/security/advisories/GHSA-c3hj-rg5h-2772", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) in RabbitMQ management UI \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Dec/3", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: usd AG Security Advisories 11/2021Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GgradzvPDbXMYGGokoP6MfBoBWI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3028", "ref_desc": "Escape username before displaying it in a pop-up message by michaelklishin \u00b7 Pull Request #3028 \u00b7 rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
