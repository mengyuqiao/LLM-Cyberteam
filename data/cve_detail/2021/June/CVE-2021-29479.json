{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29479", "Description": "Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior to 1.9.0, a user supplied `X-Forwarded-Host` header can be used to perform cache poisoning of a cache fronting a Ratpack server if the cache key does not include the `X-Forwarded-Host` header as a cache key. Users are only vulnerable if they do not configure a custom `PublicAddress` instance. For versions prior to 1.9.0, by default, Ratpack utilizes an inferring version of `PublicAddress` which is vulnerable. This can be used to perform redirect cache poisoning where an attacker can force a cached redirect to redirect to their site instead of the intended redirect location. The vulnerability was patched in Ratpack 1.9.0. As a workaround, ensure that `ServerConfigBuilder::publicAddress` correctly configures the server in production.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29479", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRatpack Project\u00bbRatpackVersions  before (<) 1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:ratpack_project:ratpack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-03-14  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-03  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-807 Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/807/Reliance-on-Untrusted-Inputs-in-a-Security-Decision.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning", "ref_desc": "Web cache poisoning | Web Security AcademyExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/security/advisories/GHSA-w6rq-6h34-vh7q", "ref_desc": "Cached redirect poisoning via X-Forwarded-Host header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ratpack/ratpack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
