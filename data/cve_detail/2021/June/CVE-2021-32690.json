{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32690", "Description": "Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32690", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nHelm\u00bbHelmVersions  before (<) 3.6.1cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-01  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-21  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.13%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf", "ref_desc": "Repository credentials passed to alternate domain \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.6.1", "ref_desc": "Release Helm 3.6.1 \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
