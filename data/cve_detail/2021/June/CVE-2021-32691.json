{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32691", "Description": "Apollos Apps is an open source platform for launching church-related apps. In Apollos Apps versions prior to 2.20.0, new user registrations are able to access anyone's account by only knowing their basic profile information (name, birthday, gender, etc). This includes all app functionality within the app, as well as any authenticated links to Rock-based webpages (such as giving and events). There is a patch in version 2.20.0. As a workaround, one can patch one's server by overriding the `create` data source method on the `People` class.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32691", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApollosapp\u00bbData-connector-rock\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.20.0cpe:2.3:a:apollosapp:data-connector-rock:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.33%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-06-04  0.18%  0.24%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-03-01  0.17%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-21  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 5  2023-12-26  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.16%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-303 Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/303/Incorrect-Implementation-of-Authentication-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ApollosProject/apollos-apps/releases/tag/v2.20.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.20.0 \u00b7 ApollosProject/apollos-apps \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ApollosProject/apollos-apps/security/advisories/GHSA-r578-pj6f-r4ff", "ref_desc": "Auto-merging Person Records Compromised \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ApollosProject/apollos-apps \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ApollosProject/apollos-apps/commit/cb5f8f1c0b24f1b215b2bb5eb6f9a8e16d728ce2", "ref_desc": "fix: turns off automerging new people (#1989) \u00b7 ApollosProject/apollos-apps@cb5f8f1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
