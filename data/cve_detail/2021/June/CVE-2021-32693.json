{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32693", "Description": "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. A vulnerability related to firewall authentication is in Symfony starting with version 5.3.0 and prior to 5.3.2. When an application defines multiple firewalls, the token authenticated by one of the firewalls was available for all other firewalls. This could be abused when the application defines different providers for each part of the application, in such a situation, a user authenticated on a part of the application could be considered authenticated on the rest of the application. Starting in version 5.3.2, a patch ensures that the authenticated token is only available for the firewall that generates it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32693", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 5.3.0andbefore (<) 5.3.2cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-05  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/security-http/commit/6bf4c31219773a558b019ee12e54572174ff8129", "ref_desc": "security #cve-2021-32693 [SecurityHttp] Fix \"Authentication granted w\u2026 \u00b7 symfony/security-http@6bf4c31 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/3084764ad82f29dbb025df19978b9cbc3ab34728", "ref_desc": "Only trigger for the correct firewall in ContextListener::onKernelRes\u2026 \u00b7 symfony/symfony@3084764 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://symfony.com/blog/cve-2021-32693-authentication-granted-to-all-firewalls-instead-of-just-one", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-32693: Authentication granted to all firewalls instead of just one (Symfony Blog)Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-rfcf-m67m-jcrq", "ref_desc": "Authentication granted to all firewalls instead of just one \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
