{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29485", "Description": "Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior to 1.9.0, a malicious attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) via a maliciously crafted Java deserialization gadget chain leveraged against the Ratpack session store. If one's application does not use Ratpack's session mechanism, it is not vulnerable. Ratpack 1.9.0 introduces a strict allow-list mechanism that mitigates this vulnerability when used. Two possible workarounds exist. The simplest mitigation for users of earlier versions is to reduce the likelihood of attackers being able to write to the session data store. Alternatively or additionally, the allow-list mechanism could be manually back ported by providing an alternative implementation of `SessionSerializer` that uses an allow-list.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29485", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nRatpack Project\u00bbRatpackVersions  before (<) 1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:ratpack_project:ratpack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-12-12  0.23%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-14  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.98%  0.22%  -1.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/security/advisories/GHSA-hc33-32vw-rpp9", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Session Storage \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ratpack/ratpack \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ratpack/ratpack-core", "ref_desc": "Maven Repository: io.ratpack \u00bb ratpack-coreRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
