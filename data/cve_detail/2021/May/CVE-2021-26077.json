{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-26077", "Description": "Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot (ACSB) in version 1.1.0 before 2.1.3 and from version 2.1.4 before 2.1.5: Atlassian Connect Spring Boot is a Java Spring Boot package for building Atlassian Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Spring Boot app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Spring Boot versions 1.1.0 before 2.1.3 and versions 2.1.4 before 2.1.5 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation events to an app.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26077", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAtlassian\u00bbConnect Spring BootVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:connect_spring_boot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAtlassian\u00bbConnect Spring BootVersions  from including (>=) 2.1.4andbefore (<) 2.1.5cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:connect_spring_boot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.10%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-09-09  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-29  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1063555147", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-26077 - Broken authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot (ACSB) - Security - Atlassian DocumentationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/action-required-atlassian-connect-vulnerability-allows-bypass-of-app-qsh-verification-via-context-jwts/47072", "ref_desc": "Action required: Atlassian Connect vulnerability allows bypass of app qsh verification via context JWTs - Announcements - The Atlassian Developer CommunityExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/im-G9wThGc4L3CPFOMiVRXkU8ls.html"}]}
