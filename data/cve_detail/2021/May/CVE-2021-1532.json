This vulnerability is due to insufficient path validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command request to the xAPI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read the contents of any file that is located on the device filesystem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1532", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRoomosVersions  before (<) 10.3.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:roomos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Collaboration EndpointVersions  from including (>=) 9.15.0.11andbefore (<) 9.15.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_collaboration_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbTelepresence Collaboration EndpointVersions  before (<) 9.14.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:telepresence_collaboration_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.09%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-tp-rmos-fileread-pE9sL3g", "ref_desc": "Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint and RoomOS Software Arbitrary File Read VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
