{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28149", "Description": "Hongdian H8922 3.0.5 devices allow Directory Traversal. The /log_download.cgi log export handler does not validate user input and allows a remote attacker with minimal privileges to download any file from the device by substituting ../ (e.g., ../../etc/passwd) This can be carried out with a web browser by changing the file name accordingly. Upon visiting log_download.cgi?type=../../etc/passwd and logging in, the web server will allow a download of the contents of the /etc/passwd file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28149", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nHongdian\u00bbH8922 Firmware\u00bbVersion:3.0.5cpe:2.3:o:hongdian:h8922_firmware:3.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Hongdian\u00bbH8922\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "31.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-18  27.46%  31.34%  +3.88 \n 2  2024-12-17  22.26%  27.46%  +5.20 \n 3  2024-11-13  17.02%  22.26%  +5.24 \n 4  2024-10-09  12.78%  17.02%  +4.25 \n 5  2024-08-22  13.94%  12.78%  -1.16 \n 6  2024-08-07  7.58%  13.94%  +6.36 \n 7  2024-05-09  5.50%  7.58%  +2.08 \n 8  2023-12-25  6.89%  5.50%  -1.39 \n 9  2023-07-29  5.23%  6.89%  +1.66 \n 10  2023-04-21  5.27%  5.23%  -0.04 \n 11  2023-03-07  1.06%  5.27%  +4.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-hongdian-h8922-multiple-vulnerabilities/", "ref_desc": "SSD Advisory \u2013 Hongdian H8922 Multiple Vulnerabilities - SSD Secure DisclosureExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/g3Oz0Xs1wyWWmvzPO4GuxtQ3a6s.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://en.hongdian.com/Products/Details/H8922", "ref_desc": "LTE industrial routerProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UOgEqokqqlmRhfroyzlALs6YEAA.html"}]}
