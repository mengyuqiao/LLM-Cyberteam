{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-26559", "Description": "Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning in the Bluetooth Mesh profile 1.0 and 1.0.1 may permit a nearby device (participating in the provisioning protocol) to identify the AuthValue used given the Provisioner\u2019s public key, and the confirmation number and nonce provided by the provisioning device. This could permit a device without the AuthValue to complete provisioning without brute-forcing the AuthValue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26559", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBluetooth\u00bbMesh Profile\u00bbVersion:1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:bluetooth:mesh_profile:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBluetooth\u00bbMesh Profile\u00bbVersion:1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:bluetooth:mesh_profile:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2024-02-07  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/reporting-security/", "ref_desc": "Reporting Security Vulnerabilities | Bluetooth\u00ae Technology WebsiteVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nOmJ8xfcFhU6JHbjuJAY_CxuZWU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/799380", "ref_desc": "VU#799380 - Devices supporting Bluetooth Core and Mesh Specifications are vulnerable to impersonation attacks and AuthValue disclosureThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/U5FyqwH_C1Y5T-Ad-EIKq7Dhh0E.html"}]}
