{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-31924", "Description": "Yubico pam-u2f before 1.1.1 has a logic issue that, depending on the pam-u2f configuration and the application used, could lead to a local PIN bypass. This issue does not allow user presence (touch) or cryptographic signature verification to be bypassed, so an attacker would still need to physically possess and interact with the YubiKey or another enrolled authenticator. If pam-u2f is configured to require PIN authentication, and the application using pam-u2f allows the user to submit NULL as the PIN, pam-u2f will attempt to perform a FIDO2 authentication without PIN. If this authentication is successful, the PIN requirement is bypassed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31924", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:35cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nYubico\u00bbPam-u2fVersions  before (<) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:yubico:pam-u2f:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-02-08  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-04  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IL3I5AKECLMK4ADLLACLOEF7H5CMNDP2/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: pam-u2f-1.2.0-2.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CRBVOZEMVO72FV4Z5O4GBGSURXHWRGD3/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 35 Update: pam-u2f-1.2.0-2.fc35 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2021-03", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory YSA-2021-03 - YubicoVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-11", "ref_desc": "Yubico pam-u2f: Local PIN Bypass vulnerability (GLSA 202208-11) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developers.yubico.com/pam-u2f/", "ref_desc": "pam-u2fProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
