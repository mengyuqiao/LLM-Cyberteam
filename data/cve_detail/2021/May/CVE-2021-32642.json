{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32642", "Description": "radsecproxy is a generic RADIUS proxy that supports both UDP and TLS (RadSec) RADIUS transports. Missing input validation in radsecproxy's `naptr-eduroam.sh` and `radsec-dynsrv.sh` scripts can lead to configuration injection via crafted radsec peer discovery DNS records. Users are subject to Information disclosure, Denial of Service, Redirection of Radius connection to a non-authenticated server leading to non-authenticated network access. Updated example scripts are available in the master branch and 1.9 release. Note that the scripts are not part of the installation package and are not updated automatically. If you are using the examples, you have to update them manually. The dyndisc scripts work independently of the radsecproxy code. The updated scripts can be used with any version of radsecproxy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32642", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUninett\u00bbRadsecproxyVersions  before (<) 1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:uninett:radsecproxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.53%  0.38%  -0.16 \n 2  2024-10-15  0.38%  0.53%  +0.16 \n 3  2024-05-31  0.37%  0.38%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-16  0.41%  0.37%  -0.04 \n 5  2024-04-19  0.29%  0.41%  +0.12 \n 6  2024-01-02  0.29%  0.29%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-12-07  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.28%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/jeitner", "ref_desc": "Injection Attacks Reloaded: Tunnelling Malicious Payloads over DNS | USENIXThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/enugqw3JRaHmKWEnAZ6goeWSDn8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W7QK5M2SZVMCAFSRQMM6PRZZRQQ372XI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: radsecproxy-1.9.0-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/radsecproxy/radsecproxy/security/advisories/GHSA-56gw-9rj9-55rc", "ref_desc": "Missing input validation in dynamic discovery example scripts. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 radsecproxy/radsecproxy \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HOC5AFG65NYLMMUTNSBOPC5F4LBAC7BR/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: radsecproxy-1.9.0-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
