This vulnerability is due to a procedural flaw in the password generation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enabling specific Administrator-only features and connecting to the appliance through the CLI with elevated privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root and access the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid Administrator credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1447", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbContent Security Management ApplianceVersions  from including (>=) 13.0.0-249andbefore (<) 13.8.1-068cpe:2.3:a:cisco:content_security_management_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbContent Security Management ApplianceVersions  before (<) 12.8.1-002cpe:2.3:a:cisco:content_security_management_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-priv-esc-JJ8zxQsC", "ref_desc": "Cisco\u00a0Content Security Management Appliance Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
