{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32633", "Description": "Zope is an open-source web application server. In Zope versions prior to 4.6 and 5.2, users can access untrusted modules indirectly through Python modules that are available for direct use. By default, only users with the Manager role can add or edit Zope Page Templates through the web, but sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope Page Templates through the web are at risk from this vulnerability. The problem has been fixed in Zope 5.2 and 4.6. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web should be restricted to trusted users only.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32633", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.2cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  before (<) 4.6cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPlone\u00bbPloneVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.2.4cpe:2.3:a:plone:plone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPlone\u00bbPloneVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.3.20cpe:2.3:a:plone:plone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.84% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.69%  0.84%  -0.85 \n 2  2024-06-23  1.20%  1.69%  +0.49 \n 3  2024-05-24  0.85%  1.20%  +0.35 \n 4  2024-02-04  0.60%  0.85%  +0.25 \n 5  2024-01-22  0.30%  0.60%  +0.30 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.26%  0.30%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.26%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/22/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: Plone security hotfix 20210518Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dpaSEaR0VH2HZrMjyeF3RbOZW7A.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://cyllective.com/blog/post/plone-authenticated-rce-cve-2021-32633/", "ref_desc": "Write-up: Plone Authenticated RCE (CVE-2021-32633)Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/commit/1f8456bf1f908ea46012537d52bd7e752a532c91", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36 \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope@1f8456b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via traversal in TAL expressions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vP5fUkqg1uub4tRpKJcKCyodF68.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/21/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Plone security hotfix 20210518Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VTsMsBbdw4c0FXZm0-q1gVudbHg.html"}]}
