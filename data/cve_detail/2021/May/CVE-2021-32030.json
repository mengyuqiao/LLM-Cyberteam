{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32030", "Description": "The administrator application on ASUS GT-AC2900 devices before 3.0.0.4.386.42643 allows authentication bypass when processing remote input from an unauthenticated user, leading to unauthorized access to the administrator interface. This relates to handle_request in router/httpd/httpd.c and auth_check in web_hook.o. An attacker-supplied value of '\\0' matches the device's default value of '\\0' in some situations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32030", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAsus\u00bbGt-ac2900 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 3.0.0.4.386.42643cpe:2.3:o:asus:gt-ac2900_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Asus\u00bbGt-ac2900\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "56.82% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  43.34%  56.82%  +13.48 \n 2  2024-11-13  43.84%  43.34%  -0.50 \n 3  2024-10-09  52.41%  43.84%  -8.57 \n 4  2024-08-07  55.14%  52.41%  -2.73 \n 5  2024-06-22  50.60%  55.14%  +4.54 \n 6  2024-04-24  53.62%  50.60%  -3.02 \n 7  2024-04-11  48.09%  53.62%  +5.53 \n 8  2024-03-14  46.34%  48.09%  +1.76 \n 9  2024-02-15  57.50%  46.34%  -11.16 \n 10  2024-01-20  62.00%  57.50%  -4.50 \n 11  2023-12-25  65.43%  62.00%  -3.43 \n 12  2023-12-11  61.92%  65.43%  +3.51 \n 13  2023-10-19  68.38%  61.92%  -6.46 \n 14  2023-09-07  66.31%  68.38%  +2.07 \n 15  2023-08-26  65.00%  66.31%  +1.31 \n 16  2023-07-29  68.00%  65.00%  -3.00 \n 17  2023-06-02  66.68%  68.00%  +1.33 \n 18  2023-05-03  64.46%  66.68%  +2.22 \n 19  2023-03-07  0.89%  64.46%  +63.57 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2020-0010.md", "ref_desc": "advisories/ATREDIS-2020-0010.md at master \u00b7 atredispartners/advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.asus.com/Networking-IoT-Servers/WiFi-Routers/ASUS-Gaming-Routers/RT-AC2900/HelpDesk_BIOS/", "ref_desc": "RT-AC2900\uff5cWiFi Routers\uff5cASUS GlobalProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
