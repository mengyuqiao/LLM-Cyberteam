{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29510", "Description": "Pydantic is a data validation and settings management using Python type hinting. In affected versions passing either `'infinity'`, `'inf'` or `float('inf')` (or their negatives) to `datetime` or `date` fields causes validation to run forever with 100% CPU usage (on one CPU). Pydantic has been patched with fixes available in the following versions: v1.8.2, v1.7.4, v1.6.2. All these versions are available on pypi(https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/#history), and will be available on conda-forge(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pydantic) soon. See the changelog(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for details. If you absolutely can't upgrade, you can work around this risk using a validator(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/) to catch these values. This is not an ideal solution (in particular you'll need a slightly different function for datetimes), instead of a hack like this you should upgrade pydantic. If you are not using v1.8.x, v1.7.x or v1.6.x and are unable to upgrade to a fixed version of pydantic, please create an issue at https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues requesting a back-port, and we will endeavour to release a patch for earlier versions of pydantic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29510", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPydantic Project\u00bbPydanticVersions  from including (>=) 1.7andbefore (<) 1.7.4cpe:2.3:a:pydantic_project:pydantic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPydantic Project\u00bbPydanticVersions  before (<) 1.6.2cpe:2.3:a:pydantic_project:pydantic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPydantic Project\u00bbPydanticVersions  from including (>=) 1.8andbefore (<) 1.8.2cpe:2.3:a:pydantic_project:pydantic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-27  0.15%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-12-18  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-22  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-08  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.13%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UMKAJX4O6IGBBCE32CO2G7PZQCCQSBLV/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: python-pydantic-1.6.2-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S2HT266L6Q7H6ICP7DFGXOGBJHNNKMKB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: python-pydantic-1.7.4-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UEFWM7DYKD2ZHE7R5YT5EQWJPV4ZKYRB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: python-fastapi-0.65.1-2.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-5jqp-qgf6-3pvh", "ref_desc": "Use of \"infinity\" as an input to datetime and date fields causes infinite loop \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 samuelcolvin/pydantic \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/commit/7e83fdd2563ffac081db7ecdf1affa65ef38c468", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5jqp-qgf6-3pvh \u00b7 samuelcolvin/pydantic@7e83fdd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
