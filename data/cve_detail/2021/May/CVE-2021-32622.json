{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32622", "Description": "Matrix-React-SDK is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32622", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix-react-sdk Project\u00bbMatrix-react-sdk\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.21.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix-react-sdk_project:matrix-react-sdk:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-31  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-22  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-11  0.07%  0.13%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.07%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-8796-gc9j-63rv", "ref_desc": "File upload local preview can run embedded scripts after user interaction \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5981", "ref_desc": "Adjust MIME type of upload confirmation if needed by jryans \u00b7 Pull Request #5981 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
