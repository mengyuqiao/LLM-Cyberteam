{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-31876", "Description": "Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31876", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nBitcoin\u00bbBitcoinVersions  from including (>=) 0.12.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.21.1cpe:2.3:a:bitcoin:bitcoin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.30%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-01-27  0.14%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-18  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-22  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.14%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin", "ref_desc": "GitHub - bitcoin/bitcoin: Bitcoin Core integration/staging treeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures#CVE-2021-31876", "ref_desc": "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - Bitcoin WikiThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-May/018893.html", "ref_desc": "[bitcoin-dev] Full Disclosure: CVE-2021-31876 Defect in Bitcoin Core's bip125 logicMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/05/12/", "ref_desc": "Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #148 | Bitcoin OptechVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/replace-by-fee/", "ref_desc": "Replace-by-fee (RBF) | Bitcoin OptechVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
