{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32635", "Description": "Singularity is an open source container platform. In verions 3.7.2 and 3.7.3, Dde to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://` URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint. An attacker may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container. Only action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected. Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote endpoint. The vulnerability is patched in Singularity version 3.7.4. Two possible workarounds exist: Users can only interact with the default remote endpoint, or an installation can have an execution control list configured to restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure keys.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32635", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSylabs\u00bbSingularity\u00bbVersion:3.7.2cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:3.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSylabs\u00bbSingularity\u00bbVersion:3.7.3cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:3.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-15  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-05-03  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-11  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-01-02  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-12-07  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.13%  -2.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-923 Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/923/Improper-Restriction-of-Communication-Channel-to-Intended-En.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-50", "ref_desc": "Singularity: Remote code execution (GLSA 202107-50) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/security/advisories/GHSA-5mv9-q7fq-9394", "ref_desc": "Action Commands (run/shell/exec) Against Library URIs Ignore Configured Remote Endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sylabs/singularity \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/tag/v3.7.4", "ref_desc": "Release Singularity 3.7.4 \u00b7 sylabs/singularity \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
