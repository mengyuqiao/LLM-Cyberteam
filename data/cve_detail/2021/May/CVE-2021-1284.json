{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1284", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based messaging service interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass authentication and authorization and modify the configuration of an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to access an associated Cisco SD-WAN vEdge device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based messaging service interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated read and write access to the affected vManage system. With this access, the attacker could access information about the affected vManage system, modify the configuration of the system, or make configuration changes to devices that are managed by the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1284", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan VmanageVersions  before (<) 20.3.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan_vmanage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCatalyst Sd-wan ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 20.5andbefore (<) 20.5.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:catalyst_sd-wan_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCatalyst Sd-wan ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 20.4andbefore (<) 20.4.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:catalyst_sd-wan_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-06  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2024-05-22  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-01-20  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
