{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32614", "Description": "A flaw was found in dmg2img through 20170502. fill_mishblk() does not check the length of the read buffer, and copy 0xCC bytes from it. The length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32614", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDmg2img Project\u00bbDmg2imgVersions  up to, including, (<=) 20170502cpe:2.3:a:dmg2img_project:dmg2img:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-09  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-31  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.06%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1959911", "ref_desc": "1959911 \u2013 (CVE-2021-32614) CVE-2021-32614 dmg2img: OOB read in memcpy() for up to 204 bytes in fill_mishblk()Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
