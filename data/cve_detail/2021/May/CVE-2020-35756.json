{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35756", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Libre Wireless LS9 LS1.5/p7040 devices. There is a luci_service GETPASS Configuration Password Information Leak. The luci_service daemon running on port 7777 does not require authentication to return the device configuration password in cleartext when using the GETPASS command. As such, any unauthenticated person with access to port 7777 on the device will be able to leak the user's personal device configuration password by issuing the GETPASS command.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35756", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLibrewireless\u00bbLs9 Firmware\u00bbVersion:7040cpe:2.3:o:librewireless:ls9_firmware:7040:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Librewireless\u00bbLS9\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.49%  +0.18 \n 2  2024-09-05  0.29%  0.31%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-25  0.29%  0.29%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-02-12  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-01-17  0.24%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-12-08  0.17%  0.24%  +0.07 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.iot-inspector.com/blog/advisory-multiple-issues-libre-wireless-ls9/", "ref_desc": "Advisory: Multiple Issues in Libre Wireless LS9 Modules - And the Problem with Third Party Products - IoT InspectorExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_kE1DbouAiDIGtQNlh0kCwSds38.html"}]}
