{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-33026", "Description": "The Flask-Caching extension through 1.10.1 for Flask relies on Pickle for serialization, which may lead to remote code execution or local privilege escalation. If an attacker gains access to cache storage (e.g., filesystem, Memcached, Redis, etc.), they can construct a crafted payload, poison the cache, and execute Python code. NOTE: a third party indicates that exploitation is extremely unlikely unless the machine is already compromised; in other cases, the attacker would be unable to write their payload to the cache and generate the required collision", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33026", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFlask-caching Project\u00bbFlask-caching\u00bbForFlaskVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.10.1cpe:2.3:a:flask-caching_project:flask-caching:*:*:*:*:*:flask:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-14  0.80%  1.13%  +0.33 \n 2  2024-04-18  0.76%  0.80%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-01-27  0.71%  0.76%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-12-18  0.69%  0.71%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-26  0.66%  0.69%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-04-28  0.64%  0.66%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-07  23.85%  0.64%  -23.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/pull/209", "ref_desc": "Extensible serializers support by subnix \u00b7 Pull Request #209 \u00b7 sh4nks/flask-caching \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-caching/pull/209#issuecomment-1136397937", "ref_desc": "Extensible serializers support by subnix \u00b7 Pull Request #209 \u00b7 pallets-eco/flask-caching \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
