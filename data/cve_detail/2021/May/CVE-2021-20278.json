{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20278", "Description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in Kiali in versions before 1.31.0 when the authentication strategy `OpenID` is used. When RBAC is enabled, Kiali assumes that some of the token validation is handled by the underlying cluster. When OpenID `implicit flow` is used with RBAC turned off, this token validation doesn't occur, and this allows a malicious user to bypass the authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20278", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nKiali\u00bbKialiVersions  before (<) 1.31.0cpe:2.3:a:kiali:kiali:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.07%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-02-11  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-01-02  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1937171", "ref_desc": "1937171 \u2013 (CVE-2021-20278) CVE-2021-20278 kiali: authentication bypass when using the OpenID login strategyIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kiali.io/news/security-bulletins/kiali-security-002/", "ref_desc": "Kiali: Service mesh observability and configurationVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
