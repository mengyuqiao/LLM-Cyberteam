{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32646", "Description": "Roomer is a discord bot cog (extension) which provides automatic voice channel generation as well as private voice and text channels. A vulnerability has been discovered allowing discord users to get the ``manage channel`` permissions in a private VC they have joined. This allowed them to make changes to or delete the voice channel they have taken over. The exploit does not allow access or control to any other channels in the server. Upgrade to version 1.0.1 for a patched version of the cog. As a workaround you may disable private VCs in your guild(server) or unload the roomer cog to render the exploit unusable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32646", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDav-cogs Project\u00bbDav-cogsVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:dav-cogs_project:dav-cogs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-11  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Dav-Git/Dav-Cogs/commit/fbe2ae8ec851a2e9e3e2370db3b812f268e8c8cb", "ref_desc": "change some permissions stuff \u00b7 Dav-Git/Dav-Cogs@fbe2ae8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Dav-Git/Dav-Cogs/security/advisories/GHSA-3f73-8j6q-28v8", "ref_desc": "Unwanted escalation of permissions in roomer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Dav-Git/Dav-Cogs \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
