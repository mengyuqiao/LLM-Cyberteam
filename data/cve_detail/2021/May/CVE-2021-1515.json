{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1515", "Description": "A vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain access to sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on API endpoints when Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software is running in multi-tenant mode. An attacker with access to a device that is managed in the multi-tenant environment could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an affected API endpoint on the vManage system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information that may include hashed credentials that could be used in future attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1515", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan VmanageVersions  before (<) 20.4.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan_vmanage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sd-wan-vmanage-9VZO4gfU", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
