{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1306", "Description": "A vulnerability in the restricted shell of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager, Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, local attacker to identify directories and write arbitrary files to the file system. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters that are sent to a CLI command within the restricted shell. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device and issuing certain CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to identify file directories on the affected device and write arbitrary files to the file system on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated shell user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1306", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.8.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbPrime Infrastructure\u00bbVersion:3.8.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_infrastructure:3.8.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEvolved Programmable Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 5.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:evolved_programmable_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services EngineVersions  before (<) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.7.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdatePatch2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.7.0:patch2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:3.0.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIdentity Services Engine\u00bbVersion:3.0.0UpdatePatch1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:3.0.0:patch1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/73/External-Control-of-File-Name-or-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ade-xcvAQEOZ", "ref_desc": "Cisco ADE-OS Local File Inclusion VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
