{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29609", "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Incomplete validation in `SparseAdd` results in allowing attackers to exploit undefined behavior (dereferencing null pointers) as well as write outside of bounds of heap allocated data. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_add_op.cc) has a large set of validation for the two sparse tensor inputs (6 tensors in total), but does not validate that the tensors are not empty or that the second dimension of `*_indices` matches the size of corresponding `*_shape`. This allows attackers to send tensor triples that represent invalid sparse tensors to abuse code assumptions that are not protected by validation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29609", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.1.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-08-06  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-665 Improper Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/665/Improper-Initialization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6fd02f44810754ae7481838b6a67c5df7f909ca3", "ref_desc": "Fix `tf.raw_ops.SparseAdd ` invalid memory access failure. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@6fd02f4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/41727ff06111117bdf86b37db198217fd7a143cc", "ref_desc": "Validate that a and b are proper sparse tensors \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@41727ff \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cjc7-49v2-jp64", "ref_desc": "Incomplete validation in `SparseAdd` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
