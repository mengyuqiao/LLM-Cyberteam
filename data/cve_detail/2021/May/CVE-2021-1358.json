This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the URL parameters in an HTTP request that is sent to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the interface to redirect the user to a specific, malicious URL.
