{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29586", "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Optimized pooling implementations in TFLite fail to check that the stride arguments are not 0 before calling `ComputePaddingHeightWidth`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3f24ccd932546416ec906a02ddd183b48a1d2c83/tensorflow/lite/kernels/pooling.cc#L90). Since users can craft special models which will have `params->stride_{height,width}` be zero, this will result in a division by zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29586", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.1.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-369 Divide By Zero", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/369/Divide-By-Zero.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-26j7-6w8w-7922", "ref_desc": "Division by zero in optimized pooling implementations in TFLite \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc", "ref_desc": "Prevent another div by 0 in optimized pooling implementations TFLite \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@5f7975d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
