{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29622", "Description": "Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system and time series database. In 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure a seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new redirect to /. Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an attacker to craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint. If a user visits a prometheus server with a specially crafted address, they can be redirected to an arbitrary URL. The issue was patched in the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases. In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely. The workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front of Prometheus.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29622", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nPrometheus\u00bbPrometheusVersions  from including (>=) 2.23.0andbefore (<) 2.26.1cpe:2.3:a:prometheus:prometheus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPrometheus\u00bbPrometheus\u00bbVersion:2.27.0cpe:2.3:a:prometheus:prometheus:2.27.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPrometheus\u00bbPrometheus\u00bbVersion:2.27.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:prometheus:prometheus:2.27.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.66%  +0.37 \n 2  2024-02-02  0.27%  0.29%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-24  0.21%  0.27%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-11-28  0.23%  0.21%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  33.92%  0.23%  -33.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/security/advisories/GHSA-vx57-7f4q-fpc7", "ref_desc": "Open Redirect under the /new endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 prometheus/prometheus \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.26.1", "ref_desc": "Release 2.26.1 / 2021-05-18 \u00b7 prometheus/prometheus \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.27.1", "ref_desc": "Release 2.27.1 / 2021-05-18 \u00b7 prometheus/prometheus \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
