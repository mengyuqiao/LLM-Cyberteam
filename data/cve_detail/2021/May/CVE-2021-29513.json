{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29513", "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Calling TF operations with tensors of non-numeric types when the operations expect numeric tensors result in null pointer dereferences. The conversion from Python array to C++ array(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ff70c47a396ef1e3cb73c90513da4f5cb71bebba/tensorflow/python/lib/core/ndarray_tensor.cc#L113-L169) is vulnerable to a type confusion. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
