{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32630", "Description": "Admidio is a free, open source user management system for websites of organizations and groups. In Admidio before version 4.0.4, there is an authenticated RCE via .phar file upload. A php web shell can be uploaded via the Documents & Files upload feature. Someone with upload permissions could rename the php shell with a .phar extension, visit the file, triggering the payload for a reverse/bind shell. This can be mitigated by excluding a .phar file extension to be uploaded (like you did with .php .phtml .php5 etc). The vulnerability is patched in version 4.0.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32630", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAdmidio\u00bbAdmidioVersions  before (<) 4.0.4cpe:2.3:a:admidio:admidio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.30%  -0.09 \n 2  2024-05-08  0.30%  0.39%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-04-11  0.31%  0.30%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-08-12  0.24%  0.31%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-xpqj-67r8-25j2", "ref_desc": "Possible upload of PHAR files and wrong check of backslash in filenames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Admidio/admidio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/issues/994", "ref_desc": "Authenticated local file inclusion possible \u00b7 Issue #994 \u00b7 Admidio/admidio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/releases/tag/v4.0.4", "ref_desc": "Release 4.0.4 \u00b7 Admidio/admidio \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
