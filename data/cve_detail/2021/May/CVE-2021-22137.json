{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22137", "Description": "In Elasticsearch versions before 7.11.2 and 6.8.15 a document disclosure flaw was found when Document or Field Level Security is used. Search queries do not properly preserve security permissions when executing certain cross-cluster search queries. This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents the attacker should not be able to view. This could result in an attacker gaining additional insight into potentially sensitive indices.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22137", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbElasticsearchVersions  before (<) 6.8.15cpe:2.3:a:elastic:elasticsearch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nElastic\u00bbElasticsearchVersions  from including (>=) 7.11.0andbefore (<) 7.11.2cpe:2.3:a:elastic:elasticsearch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-01-27  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-18  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210625-0003/", "ref_desc": "May 2021 Elasticsearch Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nzvMYm3efUkrsj-Znv43y-qb0J0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-7-12-0-and-6-8-15-security-update/268125", "ref_desc": "Elastic Stack 7.12.0 and 6.8.15 Security Update - Announcements / Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rIeOnXNdzFzdxyhPbbeNLdFvRI4.html"}]}
