{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27833", "Description": "A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27833", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift Container PlatformVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.7cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift_container_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.09%  -1.35 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-27833", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-27833- Red Hat Customer PortalVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1905945", "ref_desc": "1905945 \u2013 (CVE-2020-27833) CVE-2020-27833 openshift/oc: zip slip - arbitrary file write vulnerability / arbitrary code execution using a specially crafted container imageIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
