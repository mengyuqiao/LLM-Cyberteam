{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35580", "Description": "A local file inclusion vulnerability in the FileServlet in all SearchBlox before 9.2.2 allows remote, unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files from the operating system via a /searchblox/servlet/FileServlet?col=url= request. Additionally, this may be used to read the contents of the SearchBlox configuration file (e.g., searchblox/WEB-INF/config.xml), which contains both the Super Admin's API key and the base64 encoded SHA1 password hashes of other SearchBlox users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35580", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nSearchblox\u00bbSearchbloxVersions  before (<) 9.2.2cpe:2.3:a:searchblox:searchblox:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "15.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  9.50%  15.14%  +5.64 \n 2  2024-11-27  6.94%  9.50%  +2.56 \n 3  2024-10-23  5.02%  6.94%  +1.92 \n 4  2024-09-05  3.61%  5.02%  +1.41 \n 5  2024-08-21  1.83%  3.61%  +1.77 \n 6  2024-02-29  1.89%  1.83%  -0.06 \n 7  2024-02-03  2.05%  1.89%  -0.16 \n 8  2024-01-08  2.60%  2.05%  -0.55 \n 9  2023-09-09  2.41%  2.60%  +0.19 \n 10  2023-08-12  2.16%  2.41%  +0.25 \n 11  2023-05-05  2.18%  2.16%  -0.02 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.06%  2.18%  +1.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hateshape.github.io/general/2021/05/11/CVE-2020-35580.html", "ref_desc": "CVE-2020-35580Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.searchblox.com/docs/getting-started-with-searchblox", "ref_desc": "Getting StartedVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
