{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-24299", "Description": "The ReDi Restaurant Reservation WordPress plugin before 21.0426 provides the functionality to let users make restaurant reservations. These reservations are stored and can be listed on an 'Upcoming' page provided by the plugin. An unauthenticated user can fill in the form to make a restaurant reservation. The form to make a restaurant reservation field called 'Comment' does not use proper input validation and can be used to store XSS payloads. The XSS payloads will be executed when the plugin user goes to the 'Upcoming' page, which is an external website https://upcoming.reservationdiary.eu/ loaded in an iframe, and the stored reservation with XSS payload is loaded.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24299", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCatzsoft\u00bbRedi Restaurant Reservation\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 21.0426cpe:2.3:a:catzsoft:redi_restaurant_reservation:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-31  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  2.17%  0.08%  -2.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162756/WordPress-ReDi-Restaurant-Reservation-21.0307-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "WordPress ReDi Restaurant Reservation 21.0307 Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/fd6ce00b-8c5f-4180-b648-f47b37303670", "ref_desc": "Attention Required! | CloudflareExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
