{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32637", "Description": "Authelia is a a single sign-on multi-factor portal for web apps. This affects uses who are using nginx ngx_http_auth_request_module with Authelia, it allows a malicious individual who crafts a malformed HTTP request to bypass the authentication mechanism. It additionally could theoretically affect other proxy servers, but all of the ones we officially support except nginx do not allow malformed URI paths. The problem is rectified entirely in v4.29.3. As this patch is relatively straightforward we can back port this to any version upon request. Alternatively we are supplying a git patch to 4.25.1 which should be relatively straightforward to apply to any version, the git patches for specific versions can be found in the references. The most relevant workaround is upgrading. You can also add a block which fails requests that contains a malformed URI in the internal location block.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32637", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAuthelia\u00bbAutheliaVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.25.1cpe:2.3:a:authelia:authelia:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAuthelia\u00bbAutheliaVersions  from including (>=) 4.26.0andbefore (<) 4.29.3cpe:2.3:a:authelia:authelia:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.44% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.44%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-09-30  0.32%  0.39%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-04-19  0.23%  0.32%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-02-11  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-02  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/authelia/authelia/commit/c62dbd43d6e69ae81530e7c4f8763857f8ff1dda", "ref_desc": "fix(handlers): align response status codes for the verify endpoint (#\u2026 \u00b7 authelia/authelia@c62dbd4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authelia/authelia/security/advisories/GHSA-68wm-pfjf-wqp6", "ref_desc": "Authentication bypassed with malformed request URI on nginx \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 authelia/authelia \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
