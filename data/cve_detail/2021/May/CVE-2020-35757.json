{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35757", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Libre Wireless LS9 LS1.5/p7040 devices. There is Unauthenticated Root ADB Access Over TCP. The LS9 web interface provides functionality to access ADB over TCP. This is not enabled by default, but can be enabled by sending a crafted request to a web management interface endpoint. Requests made to this endpoint do not require authentication. As such, any unauthenticated user who is able to access the web interface will be able to gain root privileges on the LS9 module.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35757", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLibrewireless\u00bbLs9 Firmware\u00bbVersion:7040cpe:2.3:o:librewireless:ls9_firmware:7040:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Librewireless\u00bbLS9\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.94% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.49%  0.94%  +0.45 \n 2  2024-09-05  0.46%  0.49%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-03-25  0.33%  0.46%  +0.13 \n 4  2024-02-12  0.36%  0.33%  -0.03 \n 5  2024-01-17  0.32%  0.36%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-12-08  0.23%  0.32%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.iot-inspector.com/blog/advisory-multiple-issues-libre-wireless-ls9/", "ref_desc": "Advisory: Multiple Issues in Libre Wireless LS9 Modules - And the Problem with Third Party Products - IoT InspectorExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_kE1DbouAiDIGtQNlh0kCwSds38.html"}]}
