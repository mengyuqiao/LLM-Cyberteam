{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25938", "Description": "In ArangoDB, versions v2.2.6.2 through v3.7.10 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), since there is no validation of the .zip file name and filtering of potential abusive characters which zip files can be named to. There is no X-Frame-Options Header set, which makes it more susceptible for leveraging self XSS by attackers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25938", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nArangodb\u00bbArangodbVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.6.2andup to, including, (<=) 3.7.10cpe:2.3:a:arangodb:arangodb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2024-02-07  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2021-25938", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-25938 | WhiteSource Vulnerability DatabaseExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/commit/3e486b9bc33cc97e92645dd279899000e57f61f4", "ref_desc": "Bug fix 3.7/escape jquery uploadfile plugin filestring and filelistst\u2026 \u00b7 arangodb/arangodb@3e486b9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
