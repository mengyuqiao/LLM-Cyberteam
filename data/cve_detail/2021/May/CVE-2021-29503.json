{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29503", "Description": "HedgeDoc is a platform to write and share markdown. HedgeDoc before version 1.8.2 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack using the YAML-metadata of a note. An attacker with write access to a note can embed HTML tags in the Open Graph metadata section of the note, resulting in the frontend rendering the script tag as part of the `<head>` section. Unless your instance prevents guests from editing notes, this vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to inject JavaScript into notes that allow guest edits. If your instance prevents guests from editing notes, this vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to inject JavaScript into any note pages they have write-access to. This vulnerability is patched in version 1.8.2. As a workaround, one can disable guest edits until the next update.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29503", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nHedgedoc\u00bbHedgedocVersions  before (<) 1.8.2cpe:2.3:a:hedgedoc:hedgedoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-02-02  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-28  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/01dad5821ee28377ebe640c6c72c3e0bb0d51ea7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-gjg7-4j2h-94fq \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc@01dad58 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/releases/tag/1.8.2", "ref_desc": "Release HedgeDoc 1.8.2 \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-gjg7-4j2h-94fq", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in Notes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hedgedoc/hedgedoc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
