{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29509", "Description": "Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29509", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 4.3.8cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nPuma\u00bbPuma\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.3.1cpe:2.3:a:puma:puma:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.95% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.09%  0.95%  -1.14 \n 2  2024-10-14  1.97%  2.09%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-06-13  1.44%  1.97%  +0.54 \n 4  2024-05-28  1.02%  1.44%  +0.42 \n 5  2024-03-19  0.72%  1.02%  +0.30 \n 6  2024-01-25  0.63%  0.72%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-12-16  0.61%  0.63%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-11-20  0.43%  0.61%  +0.18 \n 9  2023-09-12  0.31%  0.43%  +0.13 \n 10  2023-08-03  0.15%  0.31%  +0.15 \n 11  2023-07-08  0.23%  0.15%  -0.08 \n 12  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.23%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-667 Improper Locking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/667/Improper-Locking.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/08/msg00015.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3083-1] puma security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1O3ARVuqopWVFaDvdkiisesdmrQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/nateberkopec/4b3ea5676c0d70cbb37c82d54be25837", "ref_desc": "Puma keepalive patch \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/policy", "ref_desc": "Security Policy \u00b7 puma/puma \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-28", "ref_desc": "Puma: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202208-28) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IAfZDRuzfP64ie10FFULDfZcOAk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-q28m-8xjw-8vr5", "ref_desc": "Keepalive Connections Causing Denial Of Service in puma \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 puma/puma \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rubygems.org/gems/puma", "ref_desc": "puma | RubyGems.org | your community gem hostProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
