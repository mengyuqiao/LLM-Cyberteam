{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29471", "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.33.2 \"Push rules\" can specify conditions under which they will match, including `event_match`, which matches event content against a pattern including wildcards. Certain patterns can cause very poor performance in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing moderate length events. The issue is patched in version 1.33.2. A potential workaround might be to prevent users from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at a reverse-proxy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29471", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.33.2cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-01-25  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-16  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-20  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.11%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/331/Insufficient-Entropy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.33.2", "ref_desc": "Release v1.33.2 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/03318a766cac9f8b053db2214d9c332a977d226c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-x345-32rc-8h85 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse@03318a7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TNNAJOZNMVMXM6AS7RFFKB4QLUJ4IFEY/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: matrix-synapse-1.38.1-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oPIMUqas_a3SnUkiCoZn8rZNRew.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-x345-32rc-8h85", "ref_desc": "Denial of service attack via push rule patterns \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
