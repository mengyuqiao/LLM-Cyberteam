{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29587", "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The `Prepare` step of the `SpaceToDepth` TFLite operator does not check for 0 before division(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc/tensorflow/lite/kernels/space_to_depth.cc#L63-L67). An attacker can craft a model such that `params->block_size` would be zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
