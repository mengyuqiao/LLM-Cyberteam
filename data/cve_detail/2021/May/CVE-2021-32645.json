{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32645", "Description": "Tenancy multi-tenant is an open source multi-domain controller for the Laravel web framework. In some situations, it is possible to have open redirects where users can be redirected from your site to any other site using a specially crafted URL. This is only the case for installations where the default Hostname Identification is used and the environment uses tenants that have `force_https` set to `true` (default: `false`). Version 5.7.2 contains the relevant patches to fix this bug. Stripping the URL from special characters to prevent specially crafted URL's from being redirected to. As a work around users can set the `force_https` to every tenant to `false`, however this may degrade connection security.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32645", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nTenancy\u00bbMulti-tenantVersions  from including (>=) 5.6.0andbefore (<) 5.7.2cpe:2.3:a:tenancy:multi-tenant:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-02-10  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-01  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-06  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.09%  -0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant/security/advisories/GHSA-4r8q-gv9j-3xx6", "ref_desc": "Open Redirect \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tenancy/multi-tenant \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant/commit/9c837a21bccce9bcaeb90033ef200d84f0d9e164", "ref_desc": "Trim slashes from request uri before redirecting (#1001) \u00b7 tenancy/multi-tenant@9c837a2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packagist.org/packages/hyn/multi-tenant", "ref_desc": "hyn/multi-tenant - PackagistProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/01/open-redirect-urls-is-your-site-being.html", "ref_desc": "Open redirect URLs: Is your site being abused?Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
