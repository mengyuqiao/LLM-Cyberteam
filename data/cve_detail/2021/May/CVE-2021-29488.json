{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29488", "Description": "SABnzbd is an open source binary newsreader. A vulnerability was discovered in SABnzbd that could trick the `filesystem.renamer()` function into writing downloaded files outside the configured Download Folder via malicious PAR2 files. A patch was released as part of SABnzbd 3.2.1RC1. As a workaround, limit downloads to NZBs without PAR2 files, deny write permissions to the SABnzbd process outside areas it must access to perform its job, or update to a fixed version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29488", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nSabnzbd\u00bbSabnzbdVersions  before (<) 3.2.1cpe:2.3:a:sabnzbd:sabnzbd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A\nSabnzbd\u00bbSabnzbdVersions  before (<) 3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:sabnzbd:sabnzbd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-01-21  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/security/advisories/GHSA-jwj3-wrvf-v3rp", "ref_desc": "Creation of files outside the Download Folder through malicious PAR2 files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sabnzbd/sabnzbd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
