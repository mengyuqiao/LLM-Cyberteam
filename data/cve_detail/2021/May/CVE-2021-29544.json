{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29544", "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`. This is because the implementation does not validate the rank of the `input_*` tensors. In turn, this results in the tensors being passes as they are to `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientImpl`. However, the `vec<T>` method, requires the rank to 1 and triggers a `CHECK` failure otherwise. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 as this is the only other affected version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29544", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-01  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L162-L163", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc at 95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-6g85-3hm8-83f9", "ref_desc": "`CHECK`-fail in `QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/20431e9044cf2ad3c0323c34888b192f3289af6b", "ref_desc": "Fix `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` CHECK failure. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@20431e9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.h#L295-L306", "ref_desc": "tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.h at 95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5 \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
