{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29499", "Description": "SIF is an open source implementation of the Singularity Container Image Format. The `siftool new` command and func siftool.New() produce predictable UUID identifiers due to insecure randomness in the version of the `github.com/satori/go.uuid` module used as a dependency. A patch is available in version >= v1.2.3 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. As a workaround, users passing CreateInfo struct should ensure the `ID` field is generated using a version of `github.com/satori/go.uuid` that is not vulnerable to this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29499", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSylabs\u00bbSingularity Image FormatVersions  before (<) 1.2.3cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity_image_format:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-19  0.43%  0.52%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-12-17  0.33%  0.43%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-09-09  0.31%  0.33%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-29  0.31%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-02-16  0.28%  0.31%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-01-21  0.25%  0.28%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-12-12  0.21%  0.25%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sylabs/sif/security/advisories/GHSA-4gh8-x3vv-phhg", "ref_desc": "Predictable SIF UUID Identifiers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sylabs/sif \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
