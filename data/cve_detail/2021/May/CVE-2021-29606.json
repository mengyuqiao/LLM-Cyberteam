{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29606", "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB read on heap in the TFLite implementation of `Split_V`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683/tensorflow/lite/kernels/split_v.cc#L99). If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the `SizeOfDimension` function(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.h#L148-L150) will access data outside the bounds of the tensor shape array. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29606", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.1.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ae2daeb45abfe2c6dda539cf8d0d6f653d3ef412", "ref_desc": "Prevent array OOB read/write \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@ae2daeb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-h4pc-gx2w-f2xv", "ref_desc": "Heap OOB read in TFLite \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
