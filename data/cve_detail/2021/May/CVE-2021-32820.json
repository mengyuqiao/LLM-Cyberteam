{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32820", "Description": "Express-handlebars is a Handlebars view engine for Express. Express-handlebars mixes pure template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, the layout parameter may trigger file disclosure vulnerabilities in downstream applications. This potential vulnerability is somewhat restricted in that only files with existing extentions (i.e. file.extension) can be included, files that lack an extension will have .handlebars appended to them. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-018 report. Notes in documentation have been added to help users avoid this potential information exposure vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32820", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nExpress Handlebars Project\u00bbExpress Handlebars\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.3.2cpe:2.3:a:express_handlebars_project:express_handlebars:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.02%  3.61%  -1.41 \n 2  2024-09-16  5.91%  5.02%  -0.90 \n 3  2024-08-15  2.68%  5.91%  +3.24 \n 4  2024-07-15  2.06%  2.68%  +0.62 \n 5  2024-06-16  1.76%  2.06%  +0.31 \n 6  2024-05-02  1.30%  1.76%  +0.45 \n 7  2024-01-28  1.15%  1.30%  +0.16 \n 8  2023-12-19  0.93%  1.15%  +0.22 \n 9  2023-07-08  1.00%  0.93%  -0.07 \n 10  2023-03-07  26.57%  1.00%  -25.57 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/express-handlebars/express-handlebars/blob/78c47a235c4ad7bc2674bddd8ec2721567ed8c72/README.md#danger-", "ref_desc": "express-handlebars/README.md at 78c47a235c4ad7bc2674bddd8ec2721567ed8c72 \u00b7 express-handlebars/express-handlebars \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars", "ref_desc": "express-handlebars - npmThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/express-handlebars/express-handlebars/commit/78c47a235c4ad7bc2674bddd8ec2721567ed8c72", "ref_desc": "fix: add note about security \u00b7 express-handlebars/express-handlebars@78c47a2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-018-express-handlebars/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2021-018: File disclosure in Express Handlebars - CVE-2021-32820 | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/express-handlebars/express-handlebars/pull/163", "ref_desc": "fix: use `context` property for template variables by UziTech \u00b7 Pull Request #163 \u00b7 express-handlebars/express-handlebars \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
