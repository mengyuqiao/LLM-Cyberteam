{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29489", "Description": "Highcharts JS is a JavaScript charting library based on SVG. In Highcharts versions 8 and earlier, the chart options structure was not systematically filtered for XSS vectors. The potential impact was that content from untrusted sources could execute code in the end user's browser. The vulnerability is patched in version 9. As a workaround, implementers who are not able to upgrade may apply DOMPurify recursively to the options structure to filter out malicious markup.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29489", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNetapp\u00bbOncommand Workflow Automation\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:oncommand_workflow_automation:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbOncommand Insight\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:oncommand_insight:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbCloud Backup\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:cloud_backup:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbSnapcenter\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:snapcenter:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHighcharts\u00bbHighchartsVersions  before (<) 9.0.0cpe:2.3:a:highcharts:highcharts:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.05%  -1.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/security/advisories/GHSA-8j65-4pcq-xq95", "ref_desc": "Options structure open to XSS if passed unfiltered \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 highcharts/highcharts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210622-0005/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-29489 Highcharts Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
