{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1531", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Modeling Labs could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web application on the underlying operating system of an affected Cisco Modeling Labs server. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web UI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web application, virl2, on the underlying operating system of the affected server. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials on the web UI.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1531", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbModeling Labs\u00bbVersion:2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:modeling_labs:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbModeling Labs\u00bbVersion:2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:modeling_labs:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbModeling Labs\u00bbVersion:2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:modeling_labs:2.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbModeling Labs\u00bbVersion:2.1.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:modeling_labs:2.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbModeling Labs\u00bbVersion:2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:modeling_labs:2.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbModeling Labs\u00bbVersion:2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:modeling_labs:2.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-08-14  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-07-16  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-06-05  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-07  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.10%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-88 Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/88/Improper-Neutralization-of-Argument-Delimiters-in-a-Command-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163265/Cisco-Modeling-Labs-2.1.1-b19-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Cisco Modeling Labs 2.1.1-b19 Remote Command Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cml-cmd-inject-N4VYeQXB", "ref_desc": "Cisco Modeling Labs Web UI Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
