{"CVE Code": "CVE-2020-35758", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Libre Wireless LS9 LS1.5/p7040 devices. There is a Authentication Bypass in the Web Interface. This interface does not properly restrict access to internal functionality. Despite presenting a password login page on first access, authentication is not required to access privileged functionality. As such, it's possible to directly access APIs that should not be exposed to an unauthenticated user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35758", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLibrewireless\u00bbLs9 Firmware\u00bbVersion:7040cpe:2.3:o:librewireless:ls9_firmware:7040:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Librewireless\u00bbLS9\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.34%  0.66%  +0.32 \n 2  2024-09-05  0.32%  0.34%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-25  0.23%  0.32%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-02-12  0.25%  0.23%  -0.02 \n 5  2024-01-17  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-12-08  0.23%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.iot-inspector.com/blog/advisory-multiple-issues-libre-wireless-ls9/", "ref_desc": "Advisory: Multiple Issues in Libre Wireless LS9 Modules - And the Problem with Third Party Products - IoT InspectorExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_kE1DbouAiDIGtQNlh0kCwSds38.html"}]}
