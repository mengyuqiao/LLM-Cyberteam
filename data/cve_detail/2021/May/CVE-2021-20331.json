{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-20331", "Description": "Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20331", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMongodb\u00bbC# Driver\u00bbForMongodbVersions  from including (>=) 2.12.0andbefore (<) 2.12.2cpe:2.3:a:mongodb:c\\#_driver:*:*:*:*:*:mongodb:*:*Matching versions\nMongodb\u00bbC# Driver\u00bbVersion:2.11.0ForMongodbcpe:2.3:a:mongodb:c\\#_driver:2.11.0:-:*:*:*:mongodb:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3521", "ref_desc": "[CSHARP-3521] Security sensitive commands are not redacted in command started events - MongoDB JiraIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
