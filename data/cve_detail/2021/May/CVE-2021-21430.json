{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21430", "Description": "OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. Using `File.createTempFile` in JDK will result in creating and using insecure temporary files that can leave application and system data vulnerable to attacks. Auto-generated code (Java, Scala) that deals with uploading or downloading binary data through API endpoints will create insecure temporary files during the process. Affected generators: `java` (jersey2, okhttp-gson (default library)), `scala-finch`. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21430", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenapi-generator\u00bbOpenapi GeneratorVersions  before (<) 5.1.1cpe:2.3:a:openapi-generator:openapi_generator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-08-02  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/8787", "ref_desc": "[Java] use Files.createTempFile instead by wing328 \u00b7 Pull Request #8787 \u00b7 OpenAPITools/openapi-generator \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/security/advisories/GHSA-cqxr-xf2w-943w", "ref_desc": "Generated Java and Scala Code Contains Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenAPITools/openapi-generator \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/8791", "ref_desc": "[Scala][Finch] use Files.createTempFile to avoid potential security issues by wing328 \u00b7 Pull Request #8791 \u00b7 OpenAPITools/openapi-generator \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
