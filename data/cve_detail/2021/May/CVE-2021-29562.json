{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29562", "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming from the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.IRFFT`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29562", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.1.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.2.0andbefore (<) 2.2.3cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-36vm-xw34-x4pj", "ref_desc": "`CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.IRFFT` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1c56f53be0b722ca657cbc7df461ed676c8642a2", "ref_desc": "Fix a check fail in Fast Fourier implementation \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@1c56f53 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
