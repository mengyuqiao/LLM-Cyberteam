{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-1530", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Messaging Server Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the application to consume available resources, resulting in a partial DoS condition on an affected system. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1530", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Messaging Server\u00bbVersion:22.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_messaging_server:22.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-29  0.10%  0.17%  +0.07 \n 2  2023-04-21  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.10%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bwms-xxe-uSLrZgKs", "ref_desc": "Cisco BroadWorks Messaging Server XML External Entity Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
