{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32489", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the _send_secure_msg() function of Yubico yubihsm-shell through 2.0.3. The function does not correctly validate the embedded length field of an authenticated message received from the device because response_msg.st.len=8 can be accepted but triggers an integer overflow, which causes CRYPTO_cbc128_decrypt (in OpenSSL) to encounter an undersized buffer and experience a segmentation fault. The yubihsm-shell project is included in the YubiHSM 2 SDK product.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32489", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nYubico\u00bbYubihsm-shellVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:yubico:yubihsm-shell:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.inhq.net/posts/yubico-libyubihsm-vuln2/#second-attack-variant-cve-pending", "ref_desc": "Yubico libyubihsm\u2009Vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-27217) | invd blogExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
