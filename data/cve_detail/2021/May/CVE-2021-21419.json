{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21419", "Description": "Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet process.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21419", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:33cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:34cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:34:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEventlet\u00bbEventletVersions  from including (>=) 0.10andbefore (<) 0.31.0cpe:2.3:a:eventlet:eventlet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-21  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-12  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-16  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.86 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/R5JZP4LZOSP7CUAM3GIRW6PIAWKH5VGB/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 33 Update: python-eventlet-0.31.0-1.fc33 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2WJFSBPLCNSZNHYQC4QDRDFRTEZRMD2L/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 34 Update: python-eventlet-0.31.0-1.fc34 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/security/advisories/GHSA-9p9m-jm8w-94p2", "ref_desc": "Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) and Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value in eventlet \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 eventlet/eventlet \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
