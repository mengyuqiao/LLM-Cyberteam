{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-21264", "Description": "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. A bypass of CVE-2020-26231 (fixed in 1.0.470/471 and 1.1.1) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-26231 & CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 472 (v1.0.472) and v1.1.2. As a workaround, apply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/f63519ff1e8d375df30deba63156a2fc97aa9ee7 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 472 or v1.1.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21264", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOctobercms\u00bbOctoberVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.471cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 \n 2  2023-02-22  1.40%  0.89%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-fcr8-6q7r-m4wg", "ref_desc": "Bypass of fix for CVE-2020-26231, Twig sandbox escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 octobercms/october \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
