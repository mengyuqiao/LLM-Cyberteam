{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-29625", "Description": "Adminer is open-source database management software. A cross-site scripting vulnerability in Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 affects users of MySQL, MariaDB, PgSQL and SQLite. XSS is in most cases prevented by strict CSP in all modern browsers. The only exception is when Adminer is using a `pdo_` extension to communicate with the database (it is used if the native extensions are not enabled). In browsers without CSP, Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 are affected. The vulnerability is patched in version 4.8.1. As workarounds, one can use a browser supporting strict CSP or enable the native PHP extensions (e.g. `mysqli`) or disable displaying PHP errors (`display_errors`).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29625", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nAdminer\u00bbAdminerVersions  from including (>=) 4.6.1andbefore (<) 4.8.1cpe:2.3:a:adminer:adminer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.45%  +0.21 \n 2  2024-02-02  0.22%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-24  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.21%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vrana/adminer/commit/4043092ec2c0de2258d60a99d0c5958637d051a7", "ref_desc": "Escape link in doc_link (bug #797) \u00b7 vrana/adminer@4043092 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vrana/adminer/security/advisories/GHSA-2v82-5746-vwqc", "ref_desc": "XSS in doc_link \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vrana/adminer \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sourceforge.net/p/adminer/bugs-and-features/797/", "ref_desc": "Adminer / Bugs and Features / #797 XSS via the table parameterExploit;Product;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
