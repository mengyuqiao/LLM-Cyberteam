{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-32053", "Description": "JPA Server in HAPI FHIR before 5.4.0 allows a user to deny service (e.g., disable access to the database after the attack stops) via history requests. This occurs because of a SELECT COUNT statement that requires a full index scan, with an accompanying large amount of server resources if there are many simultaneous history requests.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32053", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFhir\u00bbHapi FhirVersions  before (<) 5.4.0cpe:2.3:a:fhir:hapi_fhir:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-24  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-12-15  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-19  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hapifhir.io", "ref_desc": "HAPI FHIR - The Open Source FHIR API for JavaVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2641", "ref_desc": "Potential Denial of Service in JPA Server via history operation \u00b7 Issue #2641 \u00b7 hapifhir/hapi-fhir \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/pull/2642", "ref_desc": "Resolve weakness in history operation by jamesagnew \u00b7 Pull Request #2642 \u00b7 hapifhir/hapi-fhir \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
