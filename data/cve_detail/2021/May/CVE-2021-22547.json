{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22547", "Description": "In IoT Devices SDK, there is an implementation of calloc() that doesn't have a length check. An attacker could pass in memory objects larger than the buffer and wrap around to have a smaller buffer than required, allowing the attacker access to the other parts of the heap. We recommend upgrading the Google Cloud IoT Device SDK for Embedded C used to 1.0.3 or greater.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22547", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbCloud Iot Device Sdk For Embedded CVersions  before (<) 1.0.3cpe:2.3:a:google:cloud_iot_device_sdk_for_embedded_c:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/iot-device-sdk-embedded-c/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md", "ref_desc": "iot-device-sdk-embedded-c/RELEASE-NOTES.md at master \u00b7 GoogleCloudPlatform/iot-device-sdk-embedded-c \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/iot-device-sdk-embedded-c/pull/119", "ref_desc": "calloc limits by DellaBitta \u00b7 Pull Request #119 \u00b7 GoogleCloudPlatform/iot-device-sdk-embedded-c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
