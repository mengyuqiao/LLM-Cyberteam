{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-3559", "Description": "A flaw was found in libvirt in the virConnectListAllNodeDevices API in versions before 7.0.0. It only affects hosts with a PCI device and driver that supports mediated devices (e.g., GRID driver). This flaw could be used by an unprivileged client with a read-only connection to crash the libvirt daemon by executing the 'nodedev-list' virsh command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3559", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbLibvirtVersions  from including (>=) 6.10.0andbefore (<) 7.0.0cpe:2.3:a:redhat:libvirt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetapp\u00bbOntap Select Deploy Administration Utility\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:netapp:ontap_select_deploy_administration_utility:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210706-0006/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-3559 Libvirt Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962306", "ref_desc": "1962306 \u2013 (CVE-2021-3559) CVE-2021-3559 libvirt: nodedev-list command may cause libvirt to crash on hosts with GRID driver installedIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
