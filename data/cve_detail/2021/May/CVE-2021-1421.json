The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to a configuration command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input during the execution of this command. A successful exploit could allow a non-privileged attacker authenticated in the restricted CLI to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1421", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEnterprise Nfv Infrastructure SoftwareVersions  before (<) 4.5.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:enterprise_nfv_infrastructure_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.04%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nfvis-cmdinj-DkFjqg2j", "ref_desc": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
