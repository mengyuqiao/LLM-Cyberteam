{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34784", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34784", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbPrime InfrastructureVersions  before (<) 3.10cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_infrastructure:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEvolved Programmable Network ManagerVersions  before (<) 5.1.2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:evolved_programmable_network_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-pi-epnm-xss-U2JK537j", "ref_desc": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Evolved Programmable Network Manager Stored Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
