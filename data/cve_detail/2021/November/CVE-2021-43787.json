{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43787", "Description": "Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43787", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nNodebb\u00bbNodebbVersions  from including (>=) 1.15.5andup to, including, (<=) 1.18.4cpe:2.3:a:nodebb:nodebb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-14  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-05  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-06-22  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-12  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.sonarsource.com/nodebb-remote-code-execution-with-one-shot/", "ref_desc": "NodeBB 1.18.4 - Remote Code Execution With One ShotExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BurR0CmY3GvSARxeBnvpwDvQIx8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/1783f918bc19568f421473824461ff2ed7755e4c", "ref_desc": "fix: guard against prototype pollution \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB@1783f91 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/releases/tag/v1.18.5", "ref_desc": "Release v1.18.5 \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kuoZtBj2CKWjQeqUYxBryNzEHAo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-wx69-rvg3-x7fc", "ref_desc": "XSS via prototype pollution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NodeBB/NodeBB \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
