{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41221", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the shape inference code for the `Cudnn*` operations in TensorFlow can be tricked into accessing invalid memory, via a heap buffer overflow. This occurs because the ranks of the `input`, `input_h` and `input_c` parameters are not validated, but code assumes they have certain values. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41221", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-05-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/af5fcebb37c8b5d71c237f4e59c6477015c78ce6", "ref_desc": "Fix access to undefined memory during shape inference of Cudnn*. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@af5fceb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cqv6-3phm-hcwx", "ref_desc": "Access to invalid memory during shape inference in `Cudnn*` ops \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
