{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41211", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the shape inference code for `QuantizeV2` can trigger a read outside of bounds of heap allocated array. This occurs whenever `axis` is a negative value less than `-1`. In this case, we are accessing data before the start of a heap buffer. The code allows `axis` to be an optional argument (`s` would contain an `error::NOT_FOUND` error code). Otherwise, it assumes that `axis` is a valid index into the dimensions of the `input` tensor. If `axis` is less than `-1` then this results in a heap OOB read. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, as this version is the only one that is also affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41211", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-05-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cvgx-3v3q-m36c", "ref_desc": "Heap OOB in shape inference for `QuantizeV2` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a0d64445116c43cf46a5666bd4eee28e7a82f244", "ref_desc": "Prevent OOB access in QuantizeV2 shape inference \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@a0d6444 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
