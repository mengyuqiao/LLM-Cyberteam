{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41273", "Description": "Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with PHP 7, React, and Go. Due to improperly configured CSRF protections on two routes, a malicious user could execute a CSRF-based attack against the following endpoints: Sending a test email and Generating a node auto-deployment token. At no point would any data be exposed to the malicious user, this would simply trigger email spam to an administrative user, or generate a single auto-deployment token unexpectedly. This token is not revealed to the malicious user, it is simply created unexpectedly in the system. This has been addressed in release `1.6.6`. Users may optionally manually apply the fixes released in v1.6.6 to patch their own systems.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41273", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nPterodactyl\u00bbPanelVersions  before (<) 1.6.6cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:panel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-04-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/bf9cbe2c6d5266c6914223e067c56175de7fc3a5", "ref_desc": "Add consistent CSRF token verification to API endpoints; address secu\u2026 \u00b7 pterodactyl/panel@bf9cbe2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-wwgq-9jhf-qgw6", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Request Forgery allowing sending of test emails and generation of node auto-deployment keys \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/panel \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
