{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25979", "Description": "Apostrophe CMS versions prior to 3.3.1 did not invalidate existing login sessions when disabling a user account or changing the password, creating a situation in which a device compromised by a third party could not be locked out by those means. As a mitigation for older releases the user account in question can be archived (3.x) or moved to the trash (2.x and earlier) which does disable the existing session.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-25979", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApostrophecms\u00bbApostrophecmsVersions  from including (>=) 2.63.0andbefore (<) 3.3.1cpe:2.3:a:apostrophecms:apostrophecms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.51%  0.41%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-07-24  0.46%  0.51%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-01-31  0.38%  0.46%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-10-24  0.37%  0.38%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-16  0.34%  0.37%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-06-01  0.30%  0.34%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-04-21  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.27%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/commit/c211b211f9f4303a77a307cf41aac9b4ef8d2c7c", "ref_desc": "session object should exist in task reqs for better compatibility \u00b7 apostrophecms/apostrophe@c211b21 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
