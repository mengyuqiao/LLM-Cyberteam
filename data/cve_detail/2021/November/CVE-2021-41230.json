{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41230", "Description": "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41230", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPomerium\u00bbPomeriumVersions  from including (>=) 0.14.0andbefore (<) 0.15.6cpe:2.3:a:pomerium:pomerium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-29  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-04-18  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/2724", "ref_desc": "identity: fix user refresh by calebdoxsey \u00b7 Pull Request #2724 \u00b7 pomerium/pomerium \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/security/advisories/GHSA-j6wp-3859-vxfg", "ref_desc": "OIDC claims not updated from Identity Provider in Pomerium \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pomerium/pomerium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
