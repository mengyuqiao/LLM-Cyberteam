{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41213", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the code behind `tf.function` API can be made to deadlock when two `tf.function` decorated Python functions are mutually recursive. This occurs due to using a non-reentrant `Lock` Python object. Loading any model which contains mutually recursive functions is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service by causing users to load such models and calling a recursive `tf.function`, although this is not a frequent scenario. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41213", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC0cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflow\u00bbVersion:2.7.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-29  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-662 Improper Synchronization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/662/Improper-Synchronization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-667 Improper Locking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/667/Improper-Locking.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-h67m-xg8f-fxcf", "ref_desc": "Deadlock in mutually recursive `tf.function` objects \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/afac8158d43691661ad083f6dd9e56f327c1dcb7", "ref_desc": "Fix the deadlock issue of recursive tf.function. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@afac815 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
