{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41267", "Description": "Symfony/Http-Kernel is the HTTP kernel component for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Headers that are not part of the \"trusted_headers\" allowed list are ignored and protect users from \"Cache poisoning\" attacks. In Symfony 5.2, maintainers added support for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` headers, but this header was accessible in SubRequest, even if it was not part of the \"trusted_headers\" allowed list. An attacker could leverage this opportunity to forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header, leading to a web cache poisoning issue. Versions 5.3.12 and later have a patch to ensure that the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header is not forwarded to subrequests when it is not trusted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41267", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 5.2.0andbefore (<) 5.3.12cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-09  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-30  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-06-04  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-05-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.08%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/95dcf51682029e89450aee86267e3d553aa7c487", "ref_desc": "Fix missing extra trusted header in sub-request \u00b7 symfony/symfony@95dcf51 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-q3j3-w37x-hq2q", "ref_desc": "Webcache Poisoning via X-Forwarded-Prefix and sub-request \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/releases/tag/v5.3.12", "ref_desc": "Release v5.3.12 \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KBv06msCZPeNp3Wso_XhSXx99PI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/44243", "ref_desc": "Release v5.3.12 by fabpot \u00b7 Pull Request #44243 \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RY_RPrHCKJtsdI0MHWfzWwWK1DE.html"}]}
