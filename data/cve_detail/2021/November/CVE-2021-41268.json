{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41268", "Description": "Symfony/SecurityBundle is the security system for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Since the rework of the Remember me cookie in version 5.3.0, the cookie is not invalidated when the user changes their password. Attackers can therefore maintain their access to the account even if the password is changed as long as they have had the chance to login once and get a valid remember me cookie. Starting with version 5.3.12, Symfony makes the password part of the signature by default. In that way, when the password changes, then the cookie is not valid anymore.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41268", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 5.3.0andbefore (<) 5.3.12cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-16  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-02  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-17  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.12%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/36a808b857cd3240244f4b224452fb1e70dc6dfc", "ref_desc": "[SecurityBundle] Default signature_properties to the previous behavior \u00b7 symfony/symfony@36a808b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/releases/tag/v5.3.12", "ref_desc": "Release v5.3.12 \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KBv06msCZPeNp3Wso_XhSXx99PI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-qw36-p97w-vcqr", "ref_desc": "Remember me cookie persistance after password changes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/44243", "ref_desc": "Release v5.3.12 by fabpot \u00b7 Pull Request #44243 \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RY_RPrHCKJtsdI0MHWfzWwWK1DE.html"}]}
