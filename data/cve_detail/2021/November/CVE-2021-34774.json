{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34774", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the application does not sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to a specific API request. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the users of the application, including security questions and answers. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need valid Administrator credentials. Cisco expects to release software updates that address this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34774", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbCommon Services Platform CollectorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.10cpe:2.3:a:cisco:common_services_platform_collector:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-27  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-10-20  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-12  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cspc-info-disc-KM3bGVL", "ref_desc": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
