{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41247", "Description": "JupyterHub is an open source multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks. In affected versions users who have multiple JupyterLab tabs open in the same browser session, may see incomplete logout from the single-user server, as fresh credentials (for the single-user server only, not the Hub) reinstated after logout, if another active JupyterLab session is open while the logout takes place. Upgrade to JupyterHub 1.5. For distributed deployments, it is jupyterhub in the _user_ environment that needs patching. There are no patches necessary in the Hub environment. The only workaround is to make sure that only one JupyterLab tab is open when you log out.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41247", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbJupyterhubVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.5.0cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyterhub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-04-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/security/advisories/GHSA-cw7p-q79f-m2v7", "ref_desc": "incomplete JupyterHub logout with simultaneous JupyterLab sessions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterhub/jupyterhub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/5ac9e7f73a6e1020ffddc40321fc53336829fe27", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'fix-set-cookie' into 1.4.x \u00b7 jupyterhub/jupyterhub@5ac9e7f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
