{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43790", "Description": "Lucet is a native WebAssembly compiler and runtime. There is a bug in the main branch of `lucet-runtime` affecting all versions published to crates.io that allows a use-after-free in an Instance object that could result in memory corruption, data race, or other related issues. This bug was introduced early in the development of Lucet and is present in all releases. As a result of this bug, and dependent on the memory backing for the Instance objects, it is possible to trigger a use-after-free when the Instance is dropped. Users should upgrade to the main branch of the Lucet repository. Lucet no longer provides versioned releases on crates.io. There is no way to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43790", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nBytecodealliance\u00bbLucet\u00bbForRustVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.6.1cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:lucet:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.77% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.47%  0.77%  +0.29 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.34%  0.47%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-08-14  0.31%  0.34%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-07-05  0.25%  0.31%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-02-21  0.20%  0.25%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-07-21  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-07-07  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 8  2023-06-22  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-05-12  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.14%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://crates.io/crates/lucet-runtime", "ref_desc": "lucet-runtime - crates.io: Rust Package RegistryProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet/commit/7c7757c772fb709c61b1442bcc1e1fbee97bf4a8", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hf79-8hjp-rrvq \u00b7 bytecodealliance/lucet@7c7757c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet/security/advisories/GHSA-hf79-8hjp-rrvq", "ref_desc": "Use After Free in lucet-runtime \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bytecodealliance/lucet \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
