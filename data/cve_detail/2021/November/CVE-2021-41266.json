Affected versions are subject to an authentication bypass issue in the Operator Console when an external IDP is enabled. All users on release v0.12.2 and before are affected and are advised to update to 0.12.3 or newer. Users unable to upgrade should add automountServiceAccountToken: false to the operator-console deployment in Kubernetes so no service account token will get mounted inside the pod, then disable the external identity provider authentication by unset the CONSOLE_IDP_URL, CONSOLE_IDP_CLIENT_ID, CONSOLE_IDP_SECRET and CONSOLE_IDP_CALLBACK environment variable and instead use the Kubernetes service account token.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41266", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMIN\u00bbMinio ConsoleVersions  before (<) 0.12.3cpe:2.3:a:min:minio_console:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "28.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  6.92%  28.93%  +22.00 \n 2  2024-11-03  6.17%  6.92%  +0.75 \n 3  2024-10-07  6.07%  6.17%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-09-10  5.82%  6.07%  +0.24 \n 5  2024-07-31  6.38%  5.82%  -0.55 \n 6  2024-07-05  6.56%  6.38%  -0.18 \n 7  2024-06-21  5.38%  6.56%  +1.17 \n 8  2023-11-12  4.64%  5.38%  +0.75 \n 9  2023-08-20  5.61%  4.64%  -0.97 \n 10  2023-07-07  3.79%  5.61%  +1.82 \n 11  2023-06-08  4.00%  3.79%  -0.21 \n 12  2023-05-26  1.99%  4.00%  +2.02 \n 13  2023-05-11  1.82%  1.99%  +0.17 \n 14  2023-04-28  2.09%  1.82%  -0.27 \n 15  2023-04-15  1.25%  2.09%  +0.84 \n 16  2023-03-07  0.89%  1.25%  +0.36 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/console/pull/1217", "ref_desc": "Fixed broken oauth2 login for operator by Alevsk \u00b7 Pull Request #1217 \u00b7 minio/console \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/console/security/advisories/GHSA-4999-659w-mq36", "ref_desc": "Authentication bypass issue in the Operator Console \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/console \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
