{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41569", "Description": "SAS/Intrnet 9.4 build 1520 and earlier allows Local File Inclusion. The samples library (included by default) in the appstart.sas file, allows end-users of the application to access the sample.webcsf1.sas program, which contains user-controlled macro variables that are passed to the DS2CSF macro. Users can escape the context of the configured user-controllable variable and append additional functions native to the macro but not included as variables within the library. This includes a function that retrieves files from the host OS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41569", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nSAS\u00bbSas/intrnetVersions  before (<) 9.4cpe:2.3:a:sas:sas\\/intrnet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAS\u00bbSas/intrnet\u00bbVersion:9.4cpe:2.3:a:sas:sas\\/intrnet:9.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAS\u00bbSas/intrnet\u00bbVersion:9.4UpdateBuild1520cpe:2.3:a:sas:sas\\/intrnet:9.4:build1520:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.77% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.09%  1.77%  +0.68 \n 2  2024-10-11  0.97%  1.09%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-08-30  1.00%  0.97%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-08-04  0.88%  1.00%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-07-09  1.00%  0.88%  -0.13 \n 6  2024-06-25  0.83%  1.00%  +0.17 \n 7  2024-01-13  0.90%  0.83%  -0.07 \n 8  2023-12-30  0.98%  0.90%  -0.08 \n 9  2023-07-11  0.83%  0.98%  +0.15 \n 10  2023-05-30  0.87%  0.83%  -0.03 \n 11  2023-05-02  0.71%  0.87%  +0.16 \n 12  2023-04-05  0.75%  0.71%  -0.04 \n 13  2023-03-09  0.69%  0.75%  +0.07 \n 14  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.69%  -0.20 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.sas.com/kb/68/641.html", "ref_desc": "68641 - Sample programs that are supplied with SAS/IntrNet\u00ae contain a file inclusion vulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.mindpointgroup.com/blog/high-risk-vulnerability-discovery-localfileinclusion-sas", "ref_desc": "High-Risk\u202fVulnerability Discovery Details: LocalFileInclusion SAS V9.4 build 1520 and earlierExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
