{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34701", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the affected system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34701", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications ManagerVersions  before (<) 14su1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bb     Session ManagementEditionVersions  before (<) 14su1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:session_management:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnity ConnectionVersions  before (<) 14su1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unity_connection:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager Im And Presence ServiceVersions  before (<) 14su1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager_im_and_presence_service:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-07  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-path-trav-dKCvktvO", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Communications Products Path Traversal VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
