{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41258", "Description": "Kirby is an open source file structured CMS. In affected versions Kirby's blocks field stores structured data for each block. This data is then used in block snippets to convert the blocks to HTML for use in your templates. We recommend to escape HTML special characters to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The default snippet for the image block unfortunately did not use our escaping helper. This made it possible to include malicious HTML code in the source, alt and link fields of the image block, which would then be displayed on the site frontend and executed in the browsers of site visitors and logged in users who are browsing the site. Attackers must be in your group of authenticated Panel users in order to exploit this weakness. Users who do not make use of the blocks field are not affected. This issue has been patched in Kirby version 3.5.8 by escaping special HTML characters in the output from the default image block snippet. Please update to this or a later version to fix the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41258", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.5.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.5.7.1cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-09  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3510", "ref_desc": "Escape output in image block default snippet by lukasbestle \u00b7 Pull Request #3510 \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-cq58-r77c-5jjw", "ref_desc": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) from image block content in the site frontend \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8", "ref_desc": "Release 3.5.8 \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yRd_UIxpBoYaHdh0emvn5Y9umxQ.html"}]}
