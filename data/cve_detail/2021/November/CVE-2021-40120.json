{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-40120", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of certain Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system and execute them using root-level privileges. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as a user with root-level privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40120", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xr\u00bbVersion:4.2.3.06cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xr:4.2.3.06:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv016\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv042\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv042g\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv082\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv320\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv325\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbApplication Extension Platform\u00bbVersion:1.5.1.13cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_extension_platform:1.5.1.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.13%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-01-27  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 3  2023-06-12  0.18%  0.18%  0.00 \n 4  2023-05-28  0.11%  0.18%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.11%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sbrv-cmdinjection-Z5cWFdK", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Command Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
