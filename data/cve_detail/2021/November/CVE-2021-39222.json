{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39222", "Description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud Talk application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application is upgraded to patched versions 10.0.7, 10.1.4, 11.1.2, 11.2.0 or 12.0.0. As a workaround, use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39222", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbTalkVersions  before (<) 10.0.7cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbTalkVersions  from including (>=) 10.1.0andbefore (<) 10.1.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbTalkVersions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.1.2cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-31  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-21  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-08  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-xhxq-f4vg-jw5g", "ref_desc": "XSS in Talk \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1135481", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/542", "ref_desc": "When NextCloud 13 get released? \u00b7 Issue #542 \u00b7 nextcloud/spreed \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
