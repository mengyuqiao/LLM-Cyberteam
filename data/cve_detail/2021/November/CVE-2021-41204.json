{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41204", "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions during TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer phase, constant folding might attempt to deep copy a resource tensor. This results in a segfault, as these tensors are supposed to not change. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41204", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  before (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoogle\u00bbTensorflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-29  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/824/Access-of-Uninitialized-Pointer.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7731e8dfbe4a56773be5dc94d631611211156659", "ref_desc": "Don't constant-fold DT_RESOURCE constants. \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow@7731e8d \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-786j-5qwq-r36x", "ref_desc": "Segfault while copying constant resource tensor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tensorflow/tensorflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
