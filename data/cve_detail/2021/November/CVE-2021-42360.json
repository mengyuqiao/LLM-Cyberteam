{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-42360", "Description": "On sites that also had the Elementor plugin for WordPress installed, it was possible for users with the edit_posts capability, which includes Contributor-level users, to import blocks onto any page using the astra-page-elementor-batch-process AJAX action. An attacker could craft and host a block containing malicious JavaScript on a server they controlled, and then use it to overwrite any post or page by sending an AJAX request with the action set to astra-page-elementor-batch-process and the url parameter pointed to their remotely-hosted malicious block, as well as an id parameter containing the post or page to overwrite. Any post or page that had been built with Elementor, including published pages, could be overwritten by the imported block, and the malicious JavaScript in the imported block would then be executed in the browser of any visitors to that page.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42360", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nBrainstormforce\u00bbStarter Templates\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:brainstormforce:starter_templates:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-06-10  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-99 Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/99/Improper-Control-of-Resource-Identifiers-Resource-Injectio.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/11/over-1-million-sites-impacted-by-vulnerability-in-starter-templates-plugin/", "ref_desc": "Over 1 Million Sites Impacted by Vulnerability in Starter Templates PluginExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
