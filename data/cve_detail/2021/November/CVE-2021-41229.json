{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41229", "Description": "BlueZ is a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41229", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBluez\u00bbBluez\u00bbVersion:5.58cpe:2.3:a:bluez:bluez:5.58:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-28  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-07-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/11/msg00022.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 2827-1] bluez security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00026.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3157-1] bluez security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KRGhTMVU6RKT3jf4PhtyPtLM52Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211203-0004/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2021-41229 BlueZ Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bluez/bluez/security/advisories/GHSA-3fqg-r8j5-f5xq", "ref_desc": "There is a memory leak vulnerability in the sdp protocol, which will cause resource-consuming dos \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bluez/bluez \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
