{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-34422", "Description": "The Keybase Client for Windows before version 5.7.0 contains a path traversal vulnerability when checking the name of a file uploaded to a team folder. A malicious user could upload a file to a shared folder with a specially crafted file name which could allow a user to execute an application which was not intended on their host machine. If a malicious user leveraged this issue with the public folder sharing feature of the Keybase client, this could lead to remote code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34422", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nKeybase\u00bbKeybase\u00bbForWindowsVersions  before (<) 5.7.0cpe:2.3:a:keybase:keybase:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.40%  0.38%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-04-26  0.38%  0.40%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-03  0.37%  0.38%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-27  0.35%  0.37%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-31  0.35%  0.35%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-01  0.23%  0.35%  +0.12 \n 7  2023-07-17  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-06-19  0.15%  0.22%  +0.06 \n 9  2023-06-04  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-07  1.42%  0.13%  -1.29 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/security/security-bulletin", "ref_desc": "Security Bulletin | ZoomVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YQ3GJjIaYUb001bcQdTxsitLqig.html"}]}
