{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-39182", "Description": "EnroCrypt is a Python module for encryption and hashing. Prior to version 1.1.4, EnroCrypt used the MD5 hashing algorithm in the hashing file. Beginners who are unfamiliar with hashes can face problems as MD5 is considered an insecure hashing algorithm. The vulnerability is patched in v1.1.4 of the product. As a workaround, users can remove the `MD5` hashing function from the file `hashing.py`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39182", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnrocrypt Project\u00bbEnrocryptVersions  before (<) 1.1.4cpe:2.3:a:enrocrypt_project:enrocrypt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.25%  +0.11 \n 2  2024-09-30  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-24  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-06-14  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-06-01  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-21  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-328 Use of Weak Hash", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/328/Use-of-Weak-Hash.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Morgan-Phoenix/EnroCrypt/security/advisories/GHSA-35m5-8cvj-8783", "ref_desc": "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort and Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm and Reversible One-Way Hash in hashing.py \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Morgan-Phoenix/EnroCrypt \u00b7 GitHuThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Morgan-Phoenix/EnroCrypt/commit/e652d56ac60eadfc26489ab83927af13a9b9d8ce", "ref_desc": "Fixed GHSA-35m5-8cvj-8783 \u00b7 Morgan-Phoenix/EnroCrypt@e652d56 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
