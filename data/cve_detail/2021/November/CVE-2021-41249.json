{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41249", "Description": "GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41249", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGraphql\u00bbPlayground\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.7.28cpe:2.3:a:graphql:playground:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-10  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-28  0.09%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-04-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability in GraphQL Playground from untrusted schemas \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 graphql/graphql-playground \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HS6f44Zi5Tlnf7YiaUC23qpKSr8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/commit/b8a956006835992f12c46b90384a79ab82bcadad", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7 \u00b7 graphql/graphql-playground@b8a9560 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8", "ref_desc": "GraphiQL introspection schema template injection attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 graphql/graphiql \u00b7 GitHubNot Applicable;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nTdTlBv8XdN4JeGeHcQUaFNvReM.html"}]}
