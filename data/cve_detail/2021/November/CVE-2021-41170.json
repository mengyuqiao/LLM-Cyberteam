{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41170", "Description": "neoan3-apps/template is a neoan3 minimal template engine. Versions prior to 1.1.1 have allowed for passing in closures directly into the template engine. As a result values that are callable are executed by the template engine. The issue arises if a value has the same name as a method or function in scope and can therefore be executed either by mistake or maliciously. In theory all users of the package are affected as long as they either deal with direct user input or database values. A multi-step attack on is therefore plausible. Version 1.1.1 has addressed this vulnerability. Unfortunately only working with hardcoded values is safe in prior versions. As this likely defeats the purpose of a template engine, please upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41170", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNeoan\u00bbNeoan3-templateVersions  before (<) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:neoan:neoan3-template:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.34%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-07-24  0.22%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-05-19  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-30  0.21%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-16  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-06-01  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-04-21  0.15%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.15%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-277 Insecure Inherited Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/277/Insecure-Inherited-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sroehrl/neoan3-template/issues/8", "ref_desc": "Closure injection has a vulnerability \u00b7 Issue #8 \u00b7 sroehrl/neoan3-template \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sroehrl/neoan3-template/security/advisories/GHSA-3v56-q6r6-4gcw", "ref_desc": "Evaluation of closures can lead to execution of methods & functions in current program scope \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sroehrl/neoan3-template \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sroehrl/neoan3-template/commit/4a2c9570f071d3c8f4ac790007599cba20e16934", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: allowing for direct injection (Issue #8) \u00b7 sroehrl/neoan3-template@4a2c957 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
