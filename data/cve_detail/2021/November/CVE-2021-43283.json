{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-43283", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Victure WR1200 devices through 1.0.3. A command injection vulnerability was found within the web interface of the device, allowing an attacker with valid credentials to inject arbitrary shell commands to be executed by the device with root privileges. This occurs in the ping and traceroute features. An attacker would thus be able to use this vulnerability to open a reverse shell on the device with root privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43283", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGovicture\u00bbWr1200 FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.3cpe:2.3:o:govicture:wr1200_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Govicture\u00bbWr1200\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "13.01% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.30%  13.01%  +10.71 \n 2  2024-11-18  1.64%  2.30%  +0.67 \n 3  2024-10-22  1.86%  1.64%  -0.22 \n 4  2024-09-10  1.52%  1.86%  +0.34 \n 5  2024-08-15  1.07%  1.52%  +0.44 \n 6  2024-04-02  0.76%  1.07%  +0.31 \n 7  2023-08-05  0.69%  0.76%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.66%  0.69%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-06-23  0.50%  0.66%  +0.16 \n 10  2023-05-13  0.45%  0.50%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-04-03  0.32%  0.45%  +0.13 \n 12  2023-03-07  2.06%  0.32%  -1.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/11/12/technical-advisory-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-victure-wr1200-wifi-router-cve-2021-43282-cve-2021-43283-cve-2021-43284/", "ref_desc": "Technical Advisory \u2013 Multiple Vulnerabilities in Victure WR1200 WiFi Router (CVE-2021-43282, CVE-2021-43283, CVE-2021-43284) \u2013 NCC Group ResearchExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gQLKBK5_RWG4zazUf88zUB5pyvc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/?research=Technical+advisories", "ref_desc": "NCC Group Research \u2013 Making the world safer and more secureExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XUwwoLF-TRTSEEpJFAHawTspq3Y.html"}]}
