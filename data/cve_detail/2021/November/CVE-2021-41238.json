{"CVE Code": "CVE-2021-41238", "Description": "Hangfire is an open source system to perform background job processing in a .NET or .NET Core applications. No Windows Service or separate process required. Dashboard UI in Hangfire.Core uses authorization filters to protect it from showing sensitive data to unauthorized users. By default when no custom authorization filters specified, `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter is being used to allow only local requests and prohibit all the remote requests to provide sensible, protected by default settings. However due to the recent changes, in version 1.7.25 no authorization filters are used by default, allowing remote requests to succeed. If you are using `UseHangfireDashboard` method with default `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property value, then your installation is impacted. If any other authorization filter is specified in the `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property, the you are not impacted. Patched versions (1.7.26) are available both on Nuget.org and as a tagged release on the github repo. Default authorization rules now prohibit remote requests by default again by including the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter to the default settings. Please upgrade to the newest version in order to mitigate the issue. For users who are unable to upgrade it is possible to mitigate the issue by using the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` explicitly when configuring the Dashboard UI.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41238", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHangfire\u00bbHangfire\u00bbVersion:1.7.25cpe:2.3:a:hangfire:hangfire:1.7.25:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-18  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-08  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-16  0.12%  0.12%  0.00 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-05-26  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-15  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/security/advisories/GHSA-7rq6-7gv8-c37h", "ref_desc": "Missing Authorization with Default Settings in Dashboard UI \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 HangfireIO/Hangfire \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/issues/1958", "ref_desc": "Dashboard accessible from outside by default (since 1.7.25) \u00b7 Issue #1958 \u00b7 HangfireIO/Hangfire \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
