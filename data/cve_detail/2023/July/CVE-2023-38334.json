{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38334", "Description": "Omnis Studio 10.22.00 has incorrect access control. It advertises an irreversible feature for locking classes within Omnis libraries: it should be no longer possible to delete, view, change, copy, rename, duplicate, or print a locked class. Due to implementation issues, locked classes in Omnis libraries can be unlocked, and thus further analyzed and modified by Omnis Studio. This allows for further analyzing and also deleting, viewing, changing, copying, renaming, duplicating, or printing previously locked Omnis classes. This violates the expected behavior of an \"irreversible operation.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38334", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOmnis\u00bbStudio\u00bbVersion:10.22.00cpe:2.3:a:omnis:studio:10.22.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-21  0.29%  0.29%  0.00 \n 2  2024-08-08  0.21%  0.29%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-07-26  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-06-19  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-05-15  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-04-09  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-08-01  0.05%  0.13%  +0.08 \n 8  2023-07-25  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2023-006.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/42", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2023-006]: Omnis Studio - Expected Behavior Violation (CWE-440) (CVE-2023-38334)Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/43", "ref_desc": "SecLists.Org Security Mailing List ArchiveNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/at1jXLmsEaQfH4pVRWiPdRAUo3o.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173696/Omnis-Studio-10.22.00-Library-Unlock.html", "ref_desc": "Omnis Studio 10.22.00 Library Unlock \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
