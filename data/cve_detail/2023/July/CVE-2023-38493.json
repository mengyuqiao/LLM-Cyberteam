{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38493", "Description": "Armeria is a microservice framework Spring supports Matrix variables. When Spring integration is used, Armeria calls Spring controllers via `TomcatService` or `JettyService` with the path that may contain matrix variables. Prior to version 1.24.3, the Armeria decorators might not invoked because of the matrix variables. If an attacker sends a specially crafted request, the request may bypass the authorizer. Version 1.24.3 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38493", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinecorp\u00bbArmeriaVersions  before (<) 1.24.3cpe:2.3:a:linecorp:armeria:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-31  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-24  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/line/armeria/security/advisories/GHSA-wvp2-9ppw-337j", "ref_desc": "Paths contain matrix variables bypass decorators \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 line/armeria \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/line/armeria/commit/039db50bbfc88014ea8737fd1e1ddd6fd3fc4f07", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wvp2-9ppw-337j \u00b7 line/armeria@039db50 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.html", "ref_desc": "Matrix Variables :: Spring FrameworkProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
