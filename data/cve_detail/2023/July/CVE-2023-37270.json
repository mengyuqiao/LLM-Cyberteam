{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37270", "Description": "Piwigo is open source photo gallery software. Prior to version 13.8.0, there is a SQL Injection vulnerability in the login of the administrator screen. The SQL statement that acquires the HTTP Header `User-Agent` is vulnerable at the endpoint that records user information when logging in to the administrator screen. It is possible to execute arbitrary SQL statements. Someone who wants to exploit the vulnerability must be log in to the administrator screen, even with low privileges. Any SQL statement can be executed. Doing so may leak information from the database. Version 13.8.0 contains a fix for this issue. As another mitigation, those who want to execute a SQL statement verbatim with user-enterable parameters should be sure to escape the parameter contents appropriately.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37270", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nPiwigo\u00bbPiwigoVersions  before (<) 13.8.0cpe:2.3:a:piwigo:piwigo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.67% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-04  3.35%  4.67%  +1.32 \n 2  2024-10-24  3.17%  3.35%  +0.18 \n 3  2024-10-11  3.78%  3.17%  -0.61 \n 4  2024-07-13  3.07%  3.78%  +0.71 \n 5  2024-06-06  2.54%  3.07%  +0.53 \n 6  2024-05-02  1.95%  2.54%  +0.59 \n 7  2024-04-09  1.42%  1.95%  +0.53 \n 8  2024-03-27  1.36%  1.42%  +0.06 \n 9  2024-03-05  1.97%  1.36%  -0.61 \n 10  2024-02-23  1.77%  1.97%  +0.20 \n 11  2024-01-31  1.62%  1.77%  +0.15 \n 12  2024-01-20  1.66%  1.62%  -0.04 \n 13  2023-12-28  1.40%  1.66%  +0.26 \n 14  2023-09-08  1.27%  1.40%  +0.13 \n 15  2023-07-15  0.07%  1.27%  +1.21 \n 16  2023-07-13  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/commit/978425527d6c113887f845d75cf982bbb62d761a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-934w-qj9p-3qcx \u00b7 Piwigo/Piwigo@9784255 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://piwigo.org/release-13.8.0", "ref_desc": "Piwigo 13.8.0 | Release noteRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/blob/c01ec38bc43f09424a8d404719c35f963d63cf00/include/functions.inc.php#L621", "ref_desc": "Piwigo/include/functions.inc.php at c01ec38bc43f09424a8d404719c35f963d63cf00 \u00b7 Piwigo/Piwigo \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/security/advisories/GHSA-934w-qj9p-3qcx", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection in \"User-Agent\" \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Piwigo/Piwigo \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/blob/c01ec38bc43f09424a8d404719c35f963d63cf00/include/dblayer/functions_mysqli.inc.php#L491", "ref_desc": "Piwigo/include/dblayer/functions_mysqli.inc.php at c01ec38bc43f09424a8d404719c35f963d63cf00 \u00b7 Piwigo/Piwigo \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
