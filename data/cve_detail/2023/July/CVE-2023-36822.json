{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36822", "Description": "Uptime Kuma, a self-hosted monitoring tool, has a path traversal vulnerability in versions prior to 1.22.1. Uptime Kuma allows authenticated users to install plugins from an official list of plugins. This feature is currently disabled in the web interface, but the corresponding API endpoints are still available after login. Before a plugin is downloaded, the plugin installation directory is checked for existence. If it exists, it's removed before the plugin installation. Because the plugin is not validated against the official list of plugins or sanitized, the check for existence and the removal of the plugin installation directory are prone to path traversal. This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to delete files from the server Uptime Kuma is running on. Depending on which files are deleted, Uptime Kuma or the whole system may become unavailable due to data loss.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36822", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nUptime-kuma Project\u00bbUptime-kumaVersions  before (<) 1.22.1cpe:2.3:a:uptime-kuma_project:uptime-kuma:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-11  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-06-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-13  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-vr8x-74pm-6vj7", "ref_desc": "Authenticated path traversal via plugin repository name leading to unavailability or data loss \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/releases/tag/1.22.1", "ref_desc": "Release 1.22.1 \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/d3-j8GlhFeMXRQeJGrao0pLKrO0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/pull/3346", "ref_desc": "Drop unused code by louislam \u00b7 Pull Request #3346 \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ls9FQ9VTM_G--0Zz5k6oddaOc8I.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/de74efb2e6601dcbcfed32cddefc4078a80fcb0b/server/plugins-manager.js#L75-L80", "ref_desc": "uptime-kuma/server/plugins-manager.js at de74efb2e6601dcbcfed32cddefc4078a80fcb0b \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
