{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37261", "Description": "OpenComputers is a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers and robots to the game. This issue affects every version of OpenComputers with the Internet Card feature enabled; that is, OpenComputers 1.2.0 until 1.8.3 in their most common, default configurations. If the OpenComputers mod is installed as part of a Minecraft server hosted on a popular cloud hosting provider, such as AWS, GCP and Azure, those metadata services' API endpoints are not forbidden (aka \"blacklisted\") by default. As such, any player can gain access to sensitive information exposed via those metadata servers, potentially allowing them to pivot or privilege escalate into the hosting provider. In addition, IPv6 addresses are not correctly filtered at all, allowing broader access into the local IPv6 network. This can allow a player on a server using an OpenComputers computer to access parts of the private IPv4 address space, as well as the whole IPv6 address space, in order to retrieve sensitive information.\n\nOpenComputers v1.8.3 for Minecraft 1.7.10 and 1.12.2 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are also available. One may disable the Internet Card feature completely. If using OpenComputers 1.3.0 or above, using the allow list (`opencomputers.internet.whitelist` option) will prohibit connections to any IP addresses and/or domains not listed; or one may add entries to the block list (`opencomputers.internet.blacklist` option). More information about mitigations is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37261", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nOpencomputers\u00bbOpencomputers\u00bbForMinecraftVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andbefore (<) 1.8.3cpe:2.3:a:opencomputers:opencomputers:*:*:*:*:*:minecraft:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-11  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-13  0.12%  0.22%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-06-06  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-07-19  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/security/advisories/GHSA-7p4w-mv69-2wm2", "ref_desc": "SSRF to Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) Services Metadata Services (IMDS) not Blocked by Default \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked \u00b7 GitHubNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0gqKOvmzTJBpROQ0wiF0WmOXMy0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/commit/d13c015357fd6c42e0a1bdd6e1ef9462f0450a15", "ref_desc": "Rework Internet Card filtering system. \u00b7 MightyPirates/OpenComputers@d13c015 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues/2365", "ref_desc": "[Real world security] Http connections possible to local server network \u00b7 Issue #2365 \u00b7 MightyPirates/OpenComputers \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/releases/tag/1.12.2-forge%2F1.8.3", "ref_desc": "Release [MC1.12.2] [Forge] v1.8.3 \u00b7 MightyPirates/OpenComputers \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/5b2ba76a4c242b369b9b6ac6196fd04d96580ad0/src/main/scala/li/cil/oc/Settings.scala#L614-L637", "ref_desc": "OpenComputers/src/main/scala/li/cil/oc/Settings.scala at 5b2ba76a4c242b369b9b6ac6196fd04d96580ad0 \u00b7 MightyPirates/OpenComputers \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/security/advisories/GHSA-vvfj-xh7c-j2cm", "ref_desc": "SSRF to cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) service metadata services (IMDS) and local IPv6 addresses not blocked by default \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 MightyPirates/OpenComputers \u00b7 GitHubVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fynbcunYX_dbs3fMCyQLF5pMHMc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/5b2ba76a4c242b369b9b6ac6196fd04d96580ad0/src/main/resources/application.conf#L966-L986", "ref_desc": "OpenComputers/src/main/resources/application.conf at 5b2ba76a4c242b369b9b6ac6196fd04d96580ad0 \u00b7 MightyPirates/OpenComputers \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
