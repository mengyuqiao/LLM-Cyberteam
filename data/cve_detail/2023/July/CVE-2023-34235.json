{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34235", "Description": "Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to version 4.10.8, it is possible to leak private fields if one is using the `t(number)` prefix. Knex query allows users to change the default prefix. For example, if someone changes the prefix to be the same as it was before or to another table they want to query, the query changes from `password` to `t1.password`. `password` is protected by filtering protections but `t1.password` is not protected. This can lead to filtering attacks on everything related to the object again, including admin passwords and reset-tokens. Version 4.10.8 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34235", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nStrapi\u00bbStrapiVersions  before (<) 4.10.8cpe:2.3:a:strapi:strapi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-31  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-24  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-03  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/security/advisories/GHSA-9xg4-3qfm-9w8f", "ref_desc": "Leaking sensitive user information still possible by filtering on private with prefix fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 strapi/strapi \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases/tag/v4.10.8", "ref_desc": "Release v4.10.8 \u00b7 strapi/strapi \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v9P0wNPip0w-6q-eb1wW853pdq4.html"}]}
