{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37271", "Description": "RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python language which allows users to provide a program input into a trusted environment. RestrictedPython does not check access to stack frames and their attributes. Stack frames are accessible within at least generators and generator expressions, which are allowed inside RestrictedPython. Prior to versions 6.1 and 5.3, an attacker with access to a RestrictedPython environment can write code that gets the current stack frame in a generator and then walk the stack all the way beyond the RestrictedPython invocation boundary, thus breaking out of the restricted sandbox and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution in the Python interpreter. All RestrictedPython deployments that allow untrusted users to write Python code in the RestrictedPython environment are at risk. In terms of Zope and Plone, this would mean deployments where the administrator allows untrusted users to create and/or edit objects of type `Script (Python)`, `DTML Method`, `DTML Document` or `Zope Page Template`. This is a non-default configuration and likely to be extremely rare. The problem has been fixed in versions 6.1 and 5.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37271", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZope\u00bbRestrictedpythonVersions  before (<) 5.3cpe:2.3:a:zope:restrictedpython:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbRestrictedpython\u00bbVersion:6.0cpe:2.3:a:zope:restrictedpython:6.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbRestrictedpython\u00bbVersion:6.0UpdateA1.dev0cpe:2.3:a:zope:restrictedpython:6.0:a1.dev0:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-17  0.08%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-06-10  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-20  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-913 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/913/Improper-Control-of-Dynamically-Managed-Code-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/commit/c8eca66ae49081f0016d2e1f094c3d72095ef531", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wqc8-x2pr-7jqh \u00b7 zopefoundation/RestrictedPython@c8eca66 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/security/advisories/GHSA-wqc8-x2pr-7jqh", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary code execution via stack frame sandbox escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/RestrictedPython \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
