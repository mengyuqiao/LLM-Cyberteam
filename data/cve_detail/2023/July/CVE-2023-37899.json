{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37899", "Description": "Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. Feathers socket handler did not catch invalid string conversion errors like `const message = ${{ toString: '' }}` which would cause the NodeJS process to crash when sending an unexpected Socket.io message like `socket.emit('find', { toString: '' })`.  A fix has been released in versions 5.0.8 and 4.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37899", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFeathersjs\u00bbFeathers\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.8cpe:2.3:a:feathersjs:feathers:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nFeathersjs\u00bbFeathers\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.5.18cpe:2.3:a:feathersjs:feathers:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-23  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-20  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-25  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-06-18  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/pull/3241", "ref_desc": "fix(transport-commons): Handle invalid service paths on socket lookups by daffl \u00b7 Pull Request #3241 \u00b7 feathersjs/feathers \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/crow/CHANGELOG.md#4518-2023-07-19", "ref_desc": "feathers/CHANGELOG.md at crow \u00b7 feathersjs/feathers \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/pull/3242", "ref_desc": "fix(transport-commons): Handle invalid service paths on socket lookups by daffl \u00b7 Pull Request #3242 \u00b7 feathersjs/feathers \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/security/advisories/GHSA-hhr9-rh25-hvf9", "ref_desc": "Socket handler allows abusing implicit toString \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 feathersjs/feathers \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/dove/CHANGELOG.md#508-2023-07-19", "ref_desc": "feathers/CHANGELOG.md at dove \u00b7 feathersjs/feathers \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
