{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37462", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Improper escaping in the document `SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet` leads to an injection vector from view right on that document to programming rights, or in other words, it is possible to execute arbitrary script macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents. The attack works by opening a non-existing page with a name crafted to contain a dangerous payload. It is possible to check if an existing installation is vulnerable. See the linked GHSA for instructions on testing an installation. This issue has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4 and 15.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. The fix commit `d9c88ddc` can also be applied manually to the impacted document `SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet` and users unable to upgrade are advised to manually patch their installations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37462", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.5andbefore (<) 14.10.4cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 7.0andbefore (<) 14.4.8cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "50.71% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-09  43.05%  50.71%  +7.67 \n 2  2024-08-15  43.81%  43.05%  -0.77 \n 3  2024-08-02  36.46%  43.81%  +7.36 \n 4  2024-07-20  45.36%  36.46%  -8.90 \n 5  2024-07-09  52.33%  45.36%  -6.97 \n 6  2024-06-25  50.96%  52.33%  +1.38 \n 7  2024-06-13  48.49%  50.96%  +2.47 \n 8  2024-06-02  56.13%  48.49%  -7.64 \n 9  2024-05-20  65.93%  56.13%  -9.81 \n 10  2024-05-09  67.68%  65.93%  -1.75 \n 11  2024-04-16  55.75%  67.68%  +11.93 \n 12  2024-04-03  49.63%  55.75%  +6.12 \n 13  2024-03-25  48.30%  49.63%  +1.33 \n 14  2024-03-12  40.72%  48.30%  +7.58 \n 15  2024-03-01  39.59%  40.72%  +1.13 \n 16  2024-02-20  38.47%  39.59%  +1.12 \n 17  2024-01-27  40.10%  38.47%  -1.63 \n 18  2024-01-19  42.49%  40.10%  -2.39 \n 19  2024-01-04  32.70%  42.49%  +9.79 \n 20  2023-12-25  28.52%  32.70%  +4.18 \n 21  2023-12-17  38.66%  28.52%  -10.14 \n 22  2023-12-01  35.36%  38.66%  +3.30 \n 23  2023-11-23  26.84%  35.36%  +8.52 \n 24  2023-11-16  26.12%  26.84%  +0.72 \n 25  2023-10-29  24.15%  26.12%  +1.97 \n 26  2023-10-21  36.07%  24.15%  -11.93 \n 27  2023-07-27  1.69%  36.07%  +34.38 \n 28  2023-07-25  0.06%  1.69%  +1.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-95 Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/95/Improper-Neutralization-of-Directives-in-Dynamically-Evaluat.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20457", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20457] Privilege escalation (PR) from view right via SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d9c88ddc4c0c78fa534bd33237e95dea66003d29", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-20457: Improve escaping in SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@d9c88dd \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-h4vp-69r8-gvjg", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-skin-ui \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
