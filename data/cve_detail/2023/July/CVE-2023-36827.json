{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36827", "Description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. A path traversal (directory traversal) vulnerability affects fides versions lower than version `2.15.1`, allowing remote attackers to access arbitrary files on the fides webserver container's filesystem. The vulnerability is patched in fides `2.15.1`.\n\nIf the Fides webserver API is not directly accessible to attackers and is instead deployed behind a reverse proxy as recommended in Ethyca's security best practice documentation, and the reverse proxy is an AWS application load balancer, the vulnerability can't be exploited by these attackers. An AWS application load balancer will reject this attack with a 400 error. Additionally, any secrets supplied to the container using environment variables rather than a `fides.toml` configuration file are not affected by this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36827", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nEthyca\u00bbFidesVersions  before (<) 2.15.1cpe:2.3:a:ethyca:fides:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-06  0.46%  0.50%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-07-11  0.17%  0.46%  +0.30 \n 3  2024-06-04  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-07-13  0.06%  0.12%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/f526d9ffb176006d701493c9d0eff6b4884e811f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-r25m-cr6v-p9hq \u00b7 ethyca/fides@f526d9f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-r25m-cr6v-p9hq", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal in Webserver API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/releases/tag/2.15.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.15.1 \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
