{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37259", "Description": "matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37259", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix-react-sdk Project\u00bbMatrix-react-sdk\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 3.32.0andbefore (<) 3.76.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix-react-sdk_project:matrix-react-sdk:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nMatrix-react-sdk Project\u00bbMatrix-react-sdk\u00bbVersion:3.76.0UpdateRC1ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:matrix-react-sdk_project:matrix-react-sdk:3.76.0:rc1:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nMatrix-react-sdk Project\u00bbMatrix-react-sdk\u00bbVersion:3.76.0UpdateRC2ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:matrix-react-sdk_project:matrix-react-sdk:3.76.0:rc2:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/commit/22fcd34c606f32129ebc967fc21f24fb708a98b8", "ref_desc": "Sanitise strings going into the html export CVE-2023-37259 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk@22fcd34 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-c9vx-2g7w-rp65", "ref_desc": "Potential for XSS in Export Chat feature \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
