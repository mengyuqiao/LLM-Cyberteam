{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37901", "Description": "Indico is an open source a general-purpose, web based event management tool. There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting content from Indico. Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a speaker) and then someone else to attempt to delete this content. Considering that event organizers may want to delete suspicious-looking content when spotting it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. The risk of this could be further increased when combined with some some social engineering pointing the victim towards this content. Users need to update to Indico 3.2.6 as soon as possible. See the docs for instructions on how to update. Users who cannot upgrade should only let trustworthy users manage categories, create events or upload materials (\"submission\" privileges on a contribution/event). This should already be the case in a properly-configured setup when it comes to category/event management. Note that a conference doing a Call for Abstracts actively invites external speakers (who the organizers may not know and thus cannot fully trust) to submit content, hence the need to update to a a fixed version ASAP in particular when using such workflows.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37901", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCern\u00bbIndicoVersions  before (<) 3.2.6cpe:2.3:a:cern:indico:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/indico/indico/commit/2ee636d318653fb1ab193803dafbfe3e371d4130", "ref_desc": "Fix XSS in confirmation prompts \u00b7 indico/indico@2ee636d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/", "ref_desc": "Upgrade \u2014 Indico 3.2.7-dev documentationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.2.6", "ref_desc": "Release v3.2.6 \u00b7 indico/indico \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/indico/indico/security/advisories/GHSA-fmqq-25x9-c6hm", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site-Scripting via confirmation prompts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 indico/indico \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
