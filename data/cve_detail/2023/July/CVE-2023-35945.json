{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35945", "Description": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy\u2019s HTTP/2 codec may leak a header map and bookkeeping structures upon receiving `RST_STREAM` immediately followed by the `GOAWAY` frames from an upstream server. In nghttp2, cleanup of pending requests due to receipt of the `GOAWAY` frame skips de-allocation of the bookkeeping structure and pending compressed header. The error return [code path] is taken if connection is already marked for not sending more requests due to `GOAWAY` frame. The clean-up code is right after the return statement, causing memory leak. Denial of service through memory exhaustion. This vulnerability was patched in versions(s) 1.26.3, 1.25.8, 1.24.9, 1.23.11.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35945", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNghttp2\u00bbNghttp2Versions  before (<) 1.55.1cpe:2.3:a:nghttp2:nghttp2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.25.0andbefore (<) 1.25.8cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.23.11cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.26.0andbefore (<) 1.26.3cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.24.0andbefore (<) 1.24.9cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-14  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-19  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-459 Incomplete Cleanup", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/459/Incomplete-Cleanup.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/blob/e7f59406556c80904b81b593d38508591bb7523a/lib/nghttp2_session.c#L3346", "ref_desc": "nghttp2/lib/nghttp2_session.c at e7f59406556c80904b81b593d38508591bb7523a \u00b7 nghttp2/nghttp2 \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-jfxv-29pc-x22r", "ref_desc": "HTTP/2 memory leak in nghttp2 codec \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
