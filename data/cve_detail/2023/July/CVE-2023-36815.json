{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36815", "Description": "Sealos is a Cloud Operating System designed for managing cloud-native applications. In version 4.2.0 and prior, there is a permission flaw in the Sealos billing system, which allows users to control the recharge resource account `sealos[.] io/v1/Payment`, resulting in the ability to recharge any amount of 1 renminbi (RMB). The charging interface may expose resource information. The namespace of this custom resource would be user's control and may have permission to correct it. It is not clear whether a fix exists.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36815", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSealos\u00bbSealosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:o:sealos:sealos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-09  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-02  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2023-07-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/labring/sealos/security/advisories/GHSA-vpxf-q44g-w34w", "ref_desc": "Sealos billing system permission control defect \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 labring/sealos \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
