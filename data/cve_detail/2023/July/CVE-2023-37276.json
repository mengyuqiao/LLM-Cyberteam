{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37276", "Description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. aiohttp v3.8.4 and earlier are bundled with llhttp v6.0.6. Vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when available which is the default case when installing from a wheel. This vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie `aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by this vulnerability if you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`). Sending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can reinstall aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37276", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAiohttp\u00bbAiohttpVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.8.4cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:aiohttp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-20  0.29%  0.20%  -0.09 \n 2  2024-07-25  0.14%  0.29%  +0.15 \n 3  2024-06-18  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-07  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-07-29  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/9337fb3f2ab2b5f38d7e98a194bde6f7e3d16c40", "ref_desc": "Fix bump llhttp to v8.1.1 (#7367) (#7377) \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp@9337fb3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/v3.8.4/.gitmodules", "ref_desc": "aiohttp/.gitmodules at v3.8.4 \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-45c4-8wx5-qw6w", "ref_desc": "aiohttp.web.Application vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling via llhttp HTTP request parser \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/2001873", "ref_desc": "Node.js | Report #2001873 - HTTP Request Smuggling via Empty headers separated by CR | HackerOneExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vBXLszwF-gNa5vI1-YHAHFhFi1M.html"}]}
