{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38510", "Description": "Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. Starting in version 3.14.0 and prior to version 3.23.1, when a request is made using an API key, the backend fails to verify the permission scopes associated with the key, effectively bypassing permission checks entirely for some endpoints. It's important to note that this vulnerability only affects projects that have inadvertently exposed their API keys on the internet. Projects that have kept their API keys secure are not impacted. This issue is fixed in version 3.23.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38510", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTolgee\u00bbTolgeeVersions  from including (>=) 3.14.0andbefore (<) 3.23.1cpe:2.3:a:tolgee:tolgee:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-02  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/releases/tag/v3.23.1", "ref_desc": "Release v3.23.1 \u00b7 tolgee/tolgee-platform \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/pull/1818", "ref_desc": "fix: Disable importing with any project permission by JanCizmar \u00b7 Pull Request #1818 \u00b7 tolgee/tolgee-platform \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/commit/4776cba67e7bb8c1b0259376e3e5fa3bb46e45c7", "ref_desc": "fix: Disable importing with any project permission (#1818) \u00b7 tolgee/tolgee-platform@4776cba \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-4f9j-4vh4-p85v", "ref_desc": "Lack of Permission Check for API Key for some endpoints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tolgee/tolgee-platform \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
