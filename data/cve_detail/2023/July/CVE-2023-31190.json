{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31190", "Description": "DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver from BlueMark Innovations is affected by an\u00a0Improper Authentication vulnerability during the firmware update procedure.\n\nSpecifically, the firmware update procedure ignores and does not check the validity of the TLS certificate of the HTTPS endpoint from which the firmware update package (.tar.bz2 file) is downloaded.\nAn attacker with the ability to put himself in a Man-in-the-Middle situation (e.g., DNS poisoning, ARP poisoning, control of a node on the route to the endpoint, etc.) can trick the DroneScout ds230 to install a crafted malicious firmware update containing arbitrary files (e.g., executable and configuration) and gain administrative (root) privileges on the underlying Linux operating system.\nThis issue affects DroneScout ds230 firmware from version 20211210-1627 through 20230329-1042.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31190", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBluemark\u00bbDronescout Ds230 FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 20211210-1627andup to, including, (<=) 20230329-1042cpe:2.3:o:bluemark:dronescout_ds230_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Bluemark\u00bbDronescout Ds230\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-17  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-07-20  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://download.bluemark.io/dronescout/firmware/history.txt", "ref_desc": "Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ew7wElm8UaagQZU4BOHmBSLJErI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.nozominetworks.com/labs/vulnerability-advisories-cve-2023-31190/", "ref_desc": "Insecure Firmware Update \u2013 Nozomi NetworksThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
