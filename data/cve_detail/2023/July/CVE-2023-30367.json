{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30367", "Description": "Multi-Remote Next Generation Connection Manager (mRemoteNG) is free software that enables users to store and manage multi-protocol connection configurations to remotely connect to systems. mRemoteNG configuration files can be stored in an encrypted state on disk. mRemoteNG version <= v1.76.20 and <= 1.77.3-dev loads configuration files in plain text into memory (after decrypting them if necessary) at application start-up, even if no connection has been established yet. This allows attackers to access contents of configuration files in plain text through a memory dump and thus compromise user credentials when no custom password encryption key has been set. This also bypasses the connection configuration file encryption setting by dumping already decrypted configurations from memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30367", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMremoteng\u00bbMremotengVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.76.20cpe:2.3:a:mremoteng:mremoteng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMremoteng\u00bbMremoteng\u00bbVersion:1.77.2-nbcpe:2.3:a:mremoteng:mremoteng:1.77.2-nb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMremoteng\u00bbMremoteng\u00bbVersion:1.77.3-nbcpe:2.3:a:mremoteng:mremoteng:1.77.3-nb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.67% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-27  0.55%  0.67%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-08-14  0.59%  0.55%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-08-01  0.28%  0.59%  +0.31 \n 4  2024-07-21  0.27%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-06-25  0.22%  0.27%  +0.05 \n 6  2024-04-15  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 7  2024-04-06  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-08-05  0.15%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-07-29  0.05%  0.15%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/S1lkys/CVE-2023-30367-mRemoteNG-password-dumper", "ref_desc": "GitHub - S1lkys/CVE-2023-30367-mRemoteNG-password-dumper: Original PoC for CVE-2023-30367Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues/2420", "ref_desc": "Public Disclosure of issue 726 \u00b7 Issue #2420 \u00b7 mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173829/mRemoteNG-1.77.3.1784-NB-Sensitive-Information-Extraction.html", "ref_desc": "mRemoteNG 1.77.3.1784-NB Sensitive Information Extraction \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.secuvera.de/advisories/secuvera-SA-2023-01.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
