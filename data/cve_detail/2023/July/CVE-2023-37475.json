{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37475", "Description": "Hamba avro is a go lang encoder/decoder implementation of the avro codec specification. In affected versions a well-crafted string passed to avro's `github.com/hamba/avro/v2.Unmarshal()` can throw a `fatal error: runtime: out of memory` which is unrecoverable and can cause denial of service of the consumer of avro. The root cause of the issue is that avro uses part of the input to `Unmarshal()` to determine the size when creating a new slice and hence an attacker may consume arbitrary amounts of memory which in turn may cause the application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `b4a402f4` which has been included in release version `2.13.0`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37475", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nAvro Project\u00bbAvro\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 2.13.0cpe:2.3:a:avro_project:avro:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-23  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-16  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hamba/avro/security/advisories/GHSA-9x44-9pgq-cf45", "ref_desc": "Attacker-controlled parameter can cause DoS of avro \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hamba/avro \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/hamba/avro/commit/b4a402f41cf44b6094b5131286830ba9bb1eb290", "ref_desc": "feat: add max byte slice size config (#273) \u00b7 hamba/avro@b4a402f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
