{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34458", "Description": "mx-chain-go is the official implementation of the MultiversX blockchain protocol, written in golang. When executing a relayed transaction, if the inner transaction failed, it would have increased the inner transaction's sender account nonce. This could have contributed to a limited DoS attack on a targeted account. The fix is a breaking change so a new flag `RelayedNonceFixEnableEpoch` was needed. This was a strict processing issue while validating blocks on a chain. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.4.17.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34458", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMultiversx\u00bbMx-chain-go\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.4.17cpe:2.3:a:multiversx:mx-chain-go:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-14  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-19  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/releases/tag/v1.4.17", "ref_desc": "Release v1.4.17 \u00b7 multiversx/mx-chain-go \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/commit/babdb144f1316ab6176bf3dbd7d4621120414d43", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-j494-7x2v-vvvp \u00b7 multiversx/mx-chain-go@babdb14 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/security/advisories/GHSA-j494-7x2v-vvvp", "ref_desc": "Relayed transactions always increment nonce \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 multiversx/mx-chain-go \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/blob/babdb144f1316ab6176bf3dbd7d4621120414d43/integrationTests/vm/txsFee/relayedMoveBalance_test.go#LL165C14-L165C14", "ref_desc": "mx-chain-go/integrationTests/vm/txsFee/relayedMoveBalance_test.go at babdb144f1316ab6176bf3dbd7d4621120414d43 \u00b7 multiversx/mx-chain-go \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
