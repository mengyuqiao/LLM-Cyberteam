{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37481", "Description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing data privacy requests and privacy regulations. The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload zip files containing malicious SVG bombs (similar to a billion laughs attack), causing resource exhaustion in Admin UI browser tabs and creating a persistent denial of service of the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`). This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37481", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nEthyca\u00bbFidesVersions  from including (>=) 2.11.0andbefore (<) 2.16.0cpe:2.3:a:ethyca:fides:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-24  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-28  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/8beaace082b325e693dc7682029a3cb7e6c2b69d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-3rw2-wfc8-wmj5 \u00b7 ethyca/fides@8beaace \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-3rw2-wfc8-wmj5", "ref_desc": "Fides Webserver Vulnerable to SVG Bomb File Uploads \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
