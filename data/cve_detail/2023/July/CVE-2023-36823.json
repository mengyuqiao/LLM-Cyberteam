{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36823", "Description": "Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Using carefully crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML and CSS through Sanitize starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 6.0.2 when Sanitize is configured to use the built-in \"relaxed\" config or when using a custom config that allows `style` elements and one or more CSS at-rules. This could result in cross-site scripting or other undesired behavior when the malicious HTML and CSS are rendered in a browser. Sanitize 6.0.2 performs additional escaping of CSS in `style` element content, which fixes this issue. Users who are unable to upgrade can prevent this issue by using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow `style` elements, using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow CSS at-rules, or by manually escaping the character sequence `</` as `<\\/` in `style` element content.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36823", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSanitize Project\u00bbSanitize\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 6.0.2cpe:2.3:a:sanitize_project:sanitize:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-07  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-07-12  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-12-23  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 5  2023-07-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/commit/76ed46e6dc70820f38efe27de8dabd54dddb5220", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-f5ww-cq3m-q3g7 \u00b7 rgrove/sanitize@76ed46e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/security/advisories/GHSA-f5ww-cq3m-q3g7", "ref_desc": "Insufficient neutralization of `style` element content may allow XSS in Sanitize \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rgrove/sanitize \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/releases/tag/v6.0.2", "ref_desc": "Release v6.0.2 \u00b7 rgrove/sanitize \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00008.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3652-1] ruby-sanitize security updateMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
