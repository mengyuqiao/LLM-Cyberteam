{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36809", "Description": "Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Versions of Kiwi TCMS prior to 12.5 had introduced changes which were meant to serve all uploaded files as plain text in order to prevent browsers from executing potentially dangerous files when such files are accessed directly. The previous Nginx configuration was incorrect allowing certain browsers like Firefox to ignore the `Content-Type: text/plain` header on some occasions thus allowing potentially dangerous scripts to be executed. Additionally, file upload validators and parts of the HTML rendering code had been found to require additional sanitation and improvements. Version 12.5 fixes this vulnerability with updated Nginx content type configuration, improved file upload validation code to prevent more potentially dangerous uploads, and Sanitization of test plan names used in the `tree_view_html()` function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36809", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nKiwitcms\u00bbKiwi TcmsVersions  before (<) 12.5cpe:2.3:a:kiwitcms:kiwi_tcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-09  0.16%  0.14%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-11  0.09%  0.16%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-06-04  0.08%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-10  0.09%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-07-13  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.github.com/kiwitcms/kiwi/commit/ffb00450be52fe11a82a2507632c2328cae4ec9d", "ref_desc": "Better enforcing of mime type for uploads \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi@ffb0045 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/511489dd-ba38-4806-9029-b28ab2830aa8/", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via file upload in FireFox vulnerability found in kiwiExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/c6eeb346-fa99-4d41-bc40-b68f8d689223/", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS vulnerability found in kiwiExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/07/04/kiwi-tcms-125/", "ref_desc": "Kiwi TCMS - Kiwi TCMS 12.5Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.github.com/kiwitcms/kiwi/commit/195ea53eaaf360c19227c864cc0fe58910032c3c", "ref_desc": "Sanitize test plan name in tree_view_html() \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi@195ea53 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-jpgw-2r9m-8qfw", "ref_desc": "Misconfigured HTTP headers allowing stored XSS execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
