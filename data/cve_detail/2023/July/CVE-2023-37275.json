{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37275", "Description": "Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. The Auto-GPT command line UI makes heavy use of color-coded print statements to signify different types of system messages to the user, including messages that are crucial for the user to review and control which commands should be executed. Before v0.4.3, it was possible for a malicious external resource (such as a website browsed by Auto-GPT) to cause misleading messages to be printed to the console by getting the LLM to regurgitate JSON encoded ANSI escape sequences (`\\u001b[`). These escape sequences were JSON decoded and printed to the console as part of the model's \"thinking process\". The issue has been patched in release version 0.4.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37275", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAgpt\u00bbAuto-gptVersions  before (<) 0.4.3cpe:2.3:a:agpt:auto-gpt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-117 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/117/Improper-Output-Neutralization-for-Logs.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-r7f7-qrrv-3fjh", "ref_desc": "System logs spoofable via ANSI control sequences \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/4810", "ref_desc": "Filtering out ANSI escape codes in printed assistant thoughts by lukas-eu \u00b7 Pull Request #4810 \u00b7 Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
