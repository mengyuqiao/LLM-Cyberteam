{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37900", "Description": "Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without needing to write code. In versions prior to 1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0, a high-privileged user could create a Package referencing an arbitrarily large image containing that Crossplane would then parse, possibly resulting in exhausting all the available memory and therefore in the container being OOMKilled. The impact is limited due to the high privileges required to be able to create the Package and the eventually consistency nature of controller. This issue is fixed in versions 1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37900", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCncf\u00bbCrossplaneVersions  before (<) 1.11.5cpe:2.3:a:cncf:crossplane:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCncf\u00bbCrossplaneVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.3cpe:2.3:a:cncf:crossplane:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-04  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/security/advisories/GHSA-68p4-95xf-7gx8", "ref_desc": "Denial of service from large Package image \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 crossplane/crossplane \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/ac8b24fe739c5d942ea885157148497f196c3dd3/security/ADA-security-audit-23.pdf", "ref_desc": "crossplane/security/ADA-security-audit-23.pdf at ac8b24fe739c5d942ea885157148497f196c3dd3 \u00b7 crossplane/crossplane \u00b7 GitHubExploitCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NQAWfcJpVf26JBK4jGCWJb-sHUM.html"}]}
