{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34090", "Description": "Decidim is a participatory democracy framework, written in Ruby on Rails, originally developed for the Barcelona City government online and offline participation website. Decidim uses a third-party library named Ransack for filtering certain database collections (e.g., public meetings). By default, this library allows filtering on all data attributes and associations. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to exfiltrate non-public data from the underlying database of a Decidim instance (e.g., exfiltrating data from the user table). This issue may lead to Sensitive Data Disclosure. The problem was patched in version 0.27.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34090", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDecidim\u00bbDecidim\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 0.27.3cpe:2.3:a:decidim:decidim:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-12  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-17  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-10  0.15%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-11-20  0.11%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-09-15  0.15%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-07-19  0.05%  0.15%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/decidim/decidim/security/advisories/GHSA-jm79-9pm4-vrw9#advisory-comment-81110", "ref_desc": "Sensitive data disclosure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 decidim/decidim \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/decidim/decidim/releases/tag/v0.27.3", "ref_desc": "Release v0.27.3 \u00b7 decidim/decidim \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nHPn6nHuyEkdeGHW1631RbwMXqE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/decidim/decidim/security/advisories/GHSA-jm79-9pm4-vrw9", "ref_desc": "Sensitive data disclosure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 decidim/decidim \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
