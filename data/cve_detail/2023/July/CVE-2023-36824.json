{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36824", "Description": "Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. In Redit 7.0 prior to 7.0.12, extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Several scenarios that may lead to authenticated users executing a specially crafted `COMMAND GETKEYS` or `COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS`and authenticated users who were set with ACL rules that match key names, executing a specially crafted command that refers to a variadic list of key names. The vulnerability is patched in Redis 7.0.12.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36824", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRedis\u00bbRedisVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.12cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-15  0.47%  0.66%  +0.20 \n 2  2024-07-17  0.23%  0.47%  +0.24 \n 3  2024-06-22  0.24%  0.23%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-06-10  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-08-15  0.14%  0.23%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-07-21  0.38%  0.14%  -0.24 \n 7  2023-07-19  0.39%  0.38%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/131/Incorrect-Calculation-of-Buffer-Size.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TDNNH2ONMVNBQ6LUIAOAGDNFPKXNST5K/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: redis-7.0.12-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0DvSd5FwNKKV1x4nodFLvKIOaM4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.12", "ref_desc": "Release 7.0.12 \u00b7 redis/redis \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230814-0009/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-36824 Redis Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MIF5MAGYARYUMRFK7PQI7HYXMK2HZE5T/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: redis-7.0.12-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/REyjc9s2yLKyugGjdLWbhR5tFTk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-4cfx-h9gq-xpx3", "ref_desc": "Heap overflow in COMMAND GETKEYS and ACL evaluation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 redis/redis \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
