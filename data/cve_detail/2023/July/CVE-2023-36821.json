{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36821", "Description": "Uptime Kuma, a self-hosted monitoring tool, allows an authenticated attacker to install a maliciously crafted plugin in versions prior to 1.22.1, which may lead to remote code execution. Uptime Kuma allows authenticated users to install plugins from an official list of plugins. This feature is currently disabled in the web interface, but the corresponding API endpoints are still available after login. After downloading a plugin, it's installed by calling `npm install` in the installation directory of the plugin. Because the plugin is not validated against the official list of plugins or installed with `npm install --ignore-scripts`, a maliciously crafted plugin taking advantage of npm scripts can gain remote code execution. Version 1.22.1 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36821", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nUptime-kuma Project\u00bbUptime-kumaVersions  before (<) 1.22.1cpe:2.3:a:uptime-kuma_project:uptime-kuma:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-06  0.31%  0.35%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-07-11  0.14%  0.31%  +0.17 \n 3  2023-08-14  0.17%  0.14%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-07-13  0.06%  0.17%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-7grx-f945-mj96", "ref_desc": "Authenticated remote code execution via malicious plugin installation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/releases/tag/1.22.1", "ref_desc": "Release 1.22.1 \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/d3-j8GlhFeMXRQeJGrao0pLKrO0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/8c60e902e1c76ecbbd1b0423b07ce615341cb850/server/plugins-manager.js#L210-L216", "ref_desc": "uptime-kuma/server/plugins-manager.js at 8c60e902e1c76ecbbd1b0423b07ce615341cb850 \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/pull/3346", "ref_desc": "Drop unused code by louislam \u00b7 Pull Request #3346 \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ls9FQ9VTM_G--0Zz5k6oddaOc8I.html"}]}
