{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35833", "Description": "An issue was discovered in YSoft SAFEQ 6 Server before 6.0.82. When modifying the URL of the LDAP server configuration from LDAPS to LDAP, the system does not require the password to be (re)entered. This results in exposing cleartext credentials when connecting to a rogue LDAP server. NOTE: the vendor originally reported this as a security issue but then reconsidered because of the requirement for Admin access in order to change the configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35833", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nYsoft\u00bbSafeq ServerVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.0.82cpe:2.3:h:ysoft:safeq_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-07-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ysoft.com", "ref_desc": "Y Soft Corporation - Intelligent Enterprise Office SolutionsProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jLLpN8sxrjHhERPTJ6mIX7aX7B8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ysoft.com/en/legal/ldaps-encryption-downgrade-attack-vulnerability", "ref_desc": "LDAPS encryption downgrade attack vulnerability | Y SoftVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
