This could result in a loss of data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36256", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nOnline Examination System Project\u00bbOnline Examination System\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:online_examination_system_project:online_examination_system:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-08  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-13  0.14%  0.10%  -0.05 \n 3  2024-06-18  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-06-06  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-05-13  0.15%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 6  2024-05-02  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-01-20  0.14%  0.11%  -0.04 \n 8  2024-01-12  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-07-14  0.14%  0.09%  -0.05 \n 10  2023-07-09  0.04%  0.14%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.hackersnotes.com/blog/pentest/online-examination-system-project-1-0-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf/", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51511", "ref_desc": "Online Examination System Project 1.0 - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) - PHP webapps ExploitExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
