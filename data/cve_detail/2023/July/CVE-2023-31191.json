{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31191", "Description": "DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver from BlueMark Innovations is affected by an information loss vulnerability through traffic injection.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting, on carefully selected channels, high power spoofed Open Drone ID (ODID) messages which force the DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver to drop real Remote ID (RID) information and, instead, generate and transmit JSON encoded MQTT messages containing crafted RID information. Consequently, the MQTT broker, typically operated by a system integrator, will have no access to the drones\u2019 real RID information.\n\nThis issue affects the adjacent channel suppression algorithm present in DroneScout ds230 firmware from version 20211210-1627 through 20230329-1042.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31191", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBluemark\u00bbDronescout Ds230 FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 20211210-1627andup to, including, (<=) 20230329-1042cpe:2.3:o:bluemark:dronescout_ds230_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Bluemark\u00bbDronescout Ds230\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-07-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-221 Information Loss or Omission", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/221/Information-Loss-or-Omission.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-223 Omission of Security-relevant Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/223/Omission-of-Security-relevant-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.nozominetworks.com/labs/vulnerability-advisories-cve-2023-31191/", "ref_desc": "Information Loss through Traffic Injection - CVE-2023-31191 \u2013 Nozomi NetworksThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://download.bluemark.io/dronescout/firmware/history.txt", "ref_desc": "Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ew7wElm8UaagQZU4BOHmBSLJErI.html"}]}
