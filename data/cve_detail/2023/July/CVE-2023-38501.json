Prior to version 1.8.7, the application contains a reflected cross-site scripting via URL-parameter `?k304=...` and `?setck=...`. The worst-case outcome of this is being able to move or delete existing files on the server, or upload new files, using the account of the person who clicks the malicious link. It is recommended to change the passwords of one's copyparty accounts, unless one have inspected one's logs and found no trace of attacks. Version 1.8.7 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38501", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCopyparty Project\u00bbCopypartyVersions  before (<) 1.8.7cpe:2.3:a:copyparty_project:copyparty:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-16  0.38%  0.52%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-08-26  0.31%  0.38%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-07-31  0.21%  0.31%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-06-24  0.20%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-18  0.20%  0.20%  0.00 \n 6  2024-01-15  0.27%  0.20%  -0.07 \n 7  2024-01-05  0.28%  0.27%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-10-06  0.08%  0.28%  +0.20 \n 9  2023-08-03  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-08-01  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 11  2023-07-29  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/9001/copyparty/security/advisories/GHSA-f54q-j679-p9hh", "ref_desc": "Reflected cross-site scripting via k304 parameter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 9001/copyparty \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/9001/copyparty/commit/007d948cb982daa05bc6619cd20ee55b7e834c38", "ref_desc": "fix GHSA-f54q-j679-p9hh: reflected-XSS in cookie-setters; \u00b7 9001/copyparty@007d948 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173821/Copyparty-1.8.6-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "ref_desc": "Copyparty 1.8.6 Cross Site Scripting \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
