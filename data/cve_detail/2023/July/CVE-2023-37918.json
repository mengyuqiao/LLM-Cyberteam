{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37918", "Description": "Dapr is a portable, event-driven, runtime for building distributed applications across cloud and edge. A vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing API token authentication, which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request. Users who leverage API token authentication are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to 1.10.9 or to 1.11.2. This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who have configured API token authentication. An attacker could craft a request that is always allowed by the Dapr sidecar over HTTP, even if the `dapr-api-token` in the request is invalid or missing. The issue has been fixed in Dapr 1.10.9 or to 1.11.2. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37918", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbDaprVersions  before (<) 1.10.9cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:dapr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbDaprVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.2cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:dapr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-09  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/api-token/", "ref_desc": "Enable API token authentication in Dapr | Dapr DocsProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/security/advisories/GHSA-59m6-82qm-vqgj", "ref_desc": "API token authentication bypass in HTTP endpoints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dapr/dapr \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dapr/dapr/commit/83ca1abb11ffe34211db55dcd36d96b94252827a", "ref_desc": "Fixed API token authentication bypassed when path contains `/healthz` \u00b7 dapr/dapr@83ca1ab \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
