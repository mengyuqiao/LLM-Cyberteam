{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30586", "Description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Node.js 20 that allowed loading arbitrary OpenSSL engines when the experimental permission model is enabled, which can bypass and/or disable the permission model. The attack complexity is high. However, the crypto.setEngine() API can be used to bypass the permission model when called with a compatible OpenSSL engine. The OpenSSL engine can, for example, disable the permission model in the host process by manipulating the process's stack memory to locate the permission model Permission::enabled_ in the host process's heap memory. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30586", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.0andbefore (<) 20.3.1cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-01  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2024-07-06  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-11  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-05-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0008/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-30586 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1954535", "ref_desc": "Node.js | Report #1954535 - OpenSSL engines can be used to bypass and/or disable the permission model | HackerOneIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
