{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37472", "Description": "Knowage is an open source suite for business analytics. The application often use user supplied data to create HQL queries without prior sanitization. An attacker can create specially crafted HQL queries that will break subsequent SQL queries generated by the Hibernate engine. The endpoint `_/knowage/restful-services/2.0/documents/listDocument_` calls the `_countBIObjects_` method of the `_BIObjectDAOHibImpl_` object with the user supplied `_label_` parameter without prior sanitization. This can lead to SQL injection in the backing database. Other injections have been identified in the application as well. An authenticated attacker with low privileges could leverage this vulnerability in order to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as account credentials or business information. This issue has been addressed in version 8.1.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37472", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nENG\u00bbKnowageVersions  from including (>=) 6.1.0andbefore (<) 8.1.8cpe:2.3:a:eng:knowage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-2j3f-f696-7rgj", "ref_desc": "HQL injections \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
