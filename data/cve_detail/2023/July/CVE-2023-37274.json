{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37274", "Description": "Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. When Auto-GPT is executed directly on the host system via the provided run.sh or run.bat files, custom Python code execution is sandboxed using a temporary dedicated docker container which should not have access to any files outside of the Auto-GPT workspace directory.\nBefore v0.4.3, the `execute_python_code` command (introduced in v0.4.1) does not sanitize the `basename` arg before writing LLM-supplied code to a file with an LLM-supplied name. This allows for a path traversal attack that can overwrite any .py file outside the workspace directory by specifying a `basename` such as `../../../main.py`. This can further be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution on the host running Auto-GPT by e.g. overwriting autogpt/main.py which will be executed outside of the docker environment meant to sandbox custom python code execution the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3. As a workaround, the risk introduced by this vulnerability can be remediated by running Auto-GPT in a virtual machine, or another environment in which damage to files or corruption of the program is not a critical problem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37274", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nAgpt\u00bbAuto-gptVersions  before (<) 0.4.3cpe:2.3:a:agpt:auto-gpt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/4756", "ref_desc": "Fix up Python execution commands by Wladastic \u00b7 Pull Request #4756 \u00b7 Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-5h38-mgp9-rj5f", "ref_desc": "Python code execution sandbox escape in non-docker version \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
