{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28754", "Description": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache ShardingSphere-Agent, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by constructing a special YAML configuration file.\n\nThe attacker needs to have permission to modify the ShardingSphere Agent YAML configuration file on the target machine, and the target machine can access the URL with the arbitrary code JAR.\nAn attacker can use SnakeYAML to deserialize java.net.URLClassLoader and make it load a JAR from a specified URL, and then deserialize javax.script.ScriptEngineManager to load code using that ClassLoader. When the ShardingSphere JVM process starts and uses the ShardingSphere-Agent, the arbitrary code specified by the attacker will be executed during the deserialization of the YAML configuration file by the Agent.\n\nThis issue affects ShardingSphere-Agent: through 5.3.2. This vulnerability is fixed in Apache ShardingSphere 5.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28754", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbShardingsphereVersions  before (<) 5.4.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:shardingsphere:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-25  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-18  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-05-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-01-24  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/p8onhqox5kkwow9lc6gs03z28wtyp1cg", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-28754: ShardingSphere-Agent: Deserialization vulnerability in ShardingSphere Agent-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-28754: ShardingSphere-Agent: Deserialization vulnerability in ShardingSphere AgentMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
