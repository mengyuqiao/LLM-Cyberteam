{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38495", "Description": "Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without needing to write code. In versions prior to 1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0, Crossplane's image backend does not validate the byte contents of Crossplane packages. As such, Crossplane does not detect if an attacker has tampered with a Package. The problem has been fixed in 1.11.5, 1.12.3 and 1.13.0. As a workaround, only use images from trusted sources and keep Package editing/creating privileges to administrators only.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38495", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCncf\u00bbCrossplaneVersions  before (<) 1.11.5cpe:2.3:a:cncf:crossplane:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCncf\u00bbCrossplaneVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.3cpe:2.3:a:cncf:crossplane:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-28  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-02  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-06-26  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-28  0.13%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-08-04  0.04%  0.13%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/security/advisories/GHSA-pj4x-2xr5-w87m", "ref_desc": "Possible image tampering from missing image validation for Packages \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 crossplane/crossplane \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/ac8b24fe739c5d942ea885157148497f196c3dd3/security/ADA-security-audit-23.pdf", "ref_desc": "crossplane/security/ADA-security-audit-23.pdf at ac8b24fe739c5d942ea885157148497f196c3dd3 \u00b7 crossplane/crossplane \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Technical Description;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NQAWfcJpVf26JBK4jGCWJb-sHUM.html"}]}
