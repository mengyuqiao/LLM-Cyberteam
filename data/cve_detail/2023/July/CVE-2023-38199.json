{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38199", "Description": "coreruleset (aka OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set) through 3.3.4 does not detect multiple Content-Type request headers on some platforms. This might allow attackers to bypass a WAF with a crafted payload, aka \"Content-Type confusion\" between the WAF and the backend application. This occurs when the web application relies on only the last Content-Type header. Other platforms may reject the additional Content-Type header or merge conflicting headers, leading to detection as a malformed header.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38199", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOwasp\u00bbCorerulesetVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.3.4cpe:2.3:a:owasp:coreruleset:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-14  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-19  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-12  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-26  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/843/Access-of-Resource-Using-Incompatible-Type-Type-Confusion-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3237", "ref_desc": "feat: new rule 920620 by theMiddleBlue \u00b7 Pull Request #3237 \u00b7 coreruleset/coreruleset \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3191", "ref_desc": "Fix C9K-230327 \u00b7 Issue #3191 \u00b7 coreruleset/coreruleset \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
