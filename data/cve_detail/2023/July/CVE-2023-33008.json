{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33008", "Description": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Johnzon.\n\n\nA malicious attacker can craft up some JSON input that uses large numbers (numbers such as\u00a01e20000000) that Apache Johnzon will deserialize into BigDecimal and maybe use numbers too large which may result in a slow conversion (Denial of service risk). Apache Johnzon 1.2.21 mitigates this by setting a scale limit of 1000 (by default) to the BigDecimal. \n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Johnzon: through 1.2.20.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33008", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbJohnzonVersions  before (<) 1.2.21cpe:2.3:a:apache:johnzon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-04  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-08  0.24%  0.17%  -0.07 \n 3  2024-07-13  0.16%  0.24%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-01-12  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-08-09  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-07-15  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/qbg14djo95gfpk7o560lr8wcrzfyw43l", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-33008: Apache Johnzon: Prevent inefficient internal conversion from BigDecimal at large scale-Apache Mail ArchivesIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
