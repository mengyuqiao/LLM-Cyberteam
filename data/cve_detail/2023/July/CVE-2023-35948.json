{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35948", "Description": "Novu provides an API for sending notifications through multiple channels. Versions prior to 0.16.0 contain an open redirect vulnerability in the \"Sign In with GitHub\" functionality of Novu's open-source repository. It could have allowed an attacker to force a victim into opening a malicious URL and thus, potentially log into the repository under the victim's account gaining full control of the account. This vulnerability only affected the Novu Cloud and Open-Source deployments if the user manually enabled the GitHub OAuth on their self-hosted instance of Novu. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.0 to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35948", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nNovu\u00bbNovuVersions  before (<) 0.16cpe:2.3:a:novu:novu:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-07  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-12  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-13  0.06%  0.05%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/3510", "ref_desc": "feat: add check for at signs in redirect url by davidsoderberg \u00b7 Pull Request #3510 \u00b7 novuhq/novu \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/novuhq/novu/security/advisories/GHSA-xxv3-m43w-gv79", "ref_desc": "Open Redirect Vulnerability in Sign-In with GitHub Functionality \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 novuhq/novu \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
