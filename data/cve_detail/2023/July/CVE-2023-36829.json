{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36829", "Description": "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version 23.6.0 and prior to version 23.6.2, the Sentry API incorrectly returns the `access-control-allow-credentials: true` HTTP header if the `Origin` request header ends with the `system.base-hostname` option of Sentry installation. This only affects installations that have `system.base-hostname` option explicitly set, as it is empty by default. Impact is limited since recent versions of major browsers have cross-site cookie blocking enabled by default. However, this flaw could allow other multi-step attacks. The patch has been released in Sentry 23.6.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36829", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFunctional\u00bbSentryVersions  from including (>=) 23.6.0andbefore (<) 23.6.2cpe:2.3:a:functional:sentry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-07  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-12  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/697/Incorrect-Comparison.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-942 Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/942/Permissive-Cross-domain-Policy-with-Untrusted-Domains.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.6.2", "ref_desc": "Release 23.6.2 \u00b7 getsentry/self-hosted \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/ee44c6be35e5e464bc40637580f39867898acd8b", "ref_desc": "Fix GHSA-4xqm-4p72-87h6 (#52276) \u00b7 getsentry/sentry@ee44c6b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-4xqm-4p72-87h6", "ref_desc": "CORS misconfiguration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/52276", "ref_desc": "Fix GHSA-4xqm-4p72-87h6 by oioki \u00b7 Pull Request #52276 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
