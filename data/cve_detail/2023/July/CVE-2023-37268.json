{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37268", "Description": "Warpgate is an SSH, HTTPS and MySQL bastion host for Linux that doesn't need special client apps. When logging in as a user with SSO enabled an attacker may authenticate as an other user. Any user account which does not have a second factor enabled could be compromised. This issue has been addressed in commit `8173f6512a` and in releases starting with version 0.7.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should require their users to use a second factor in authentication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37268", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nWarpgate Project\u00bbWarpgate\u00bbVersion:0.7.2cpe:2.3:a:warpgate_project:warpgate:0.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-20  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-07-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/security/advisories/GHSA-868r-97g5-r9g4", "ref_desc": "SSO user can login as another SSO only user \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 warp-tech/warpgate \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/commit/8173f6512ab6183fa5edc5c9a5f3760b8979271e", "ref_desc": "fixed GHSA-868r-97g5-r9g4 - insufficient authentication for SSO users \u00b7 warp-tech/warpgate@8173f65 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
