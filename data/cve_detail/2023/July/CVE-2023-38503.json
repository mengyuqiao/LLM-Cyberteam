{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38503", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 10.3.0 and prior to version 10.5.0, the permission filters (i.e. `user_created IS $CURRENT_USER`) are not properly checked when using GraphQL subscription resulting in unauthorized users getting event on their subscription which they should not be receiving according to the permissions. This can be any collection but out-of-the box the `directus_users` collection is configured with such a permissions filter allowing you to get updates for other users when changes happen. Version 10.5.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, disable GraphQL subscriptions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38503", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMonospace\u00bbDirectus\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 10.3.0andbefore (<) 10.5.0cpe:2.3:a:monospace:directus:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-31  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-04  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-gggm-66rh-pp98", "ref_desc": "Incorrect Permission Checking for GraphQL Subscriptions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/19155", "ref_desc": "Using the same data fetching logic for rest and graphql by br41nslug \u00b7 Pull Request #19155 \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
