{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35936", "Description": "Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. Starting in version 1.13 and prior to version 3.1.4, Pandoc is susceptible to an arbitrary file write vulnerability, which can be triggered by providing a specially crafted image element in the input when generating files using the `--extract-media` option or outputting to PDF format. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system ,depending on the privileges of the process running pandoc. It only affects systems that pass untrusted user input to pandoc and allow pandoc to be used to produce a PDF or with the `--extract-media` option.\n\nThe fix is to unescape the percent-encoding prior to checking that the resource is not above the working directory, and prior to extracting the extension.  Some code for checking that the path is below the working directory was flawed in a similar way and has also been fixed. Note that the `--sandbox` option, which only affects IO done by readers and writers themselves, does not block this vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in pandoc 3.1.4. As a workaround, audit the pandoc command and disallow PDF output and the `--extract-media` option.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35936", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPandoc\u00bbPandocVersions  from including (>=) 1.13andbefore (<) 3.1.4cpe:2.3:a:pandoc:pandoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-09  0.13%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-11  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-03-30  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JGRJHU2FTSGTHHRTNDF7STEKLKKA25JN/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: ghc-hakyll-4.16.2.0-4.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYP3FKDS3KAYMQUZVVL73IUI4CWSKLKP/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: pandoc-2.19.2-22.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00029.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3507-1] pandoc security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hkVrKkEYqqVt5k8J2FTTXWoLiUY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QI6RBP6ZKVC2OOCV6SU2FUHPMAXDDJFU/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 40 Update: patat-0.11.0.0-1.fc40 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/security/advisories/GHSA-xj5q-fv23-575g", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary file write is possible when using PDF output or --extract-media with untrusted input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jgm/pandoc \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
