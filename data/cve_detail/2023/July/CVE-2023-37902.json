{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37902", "Description": "Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37902", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyper\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 0.3.9cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-31  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-04  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-252 Unchecked Return Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/252/Unchecked-Return-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/019a37ab98ff53f04fecfadf602b6cd5ac748f7f", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-f5x6-7qgp-jhf3 \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@019a37a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-f5x6-7qgp-jhf3", "ref_desc": "ecrecover can return undefined data for invalid signatures \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
