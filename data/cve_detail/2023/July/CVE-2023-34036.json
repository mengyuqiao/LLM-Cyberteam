{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34036", "Description": "Reactive web applications that use Spring HATEOAS to produce hypermedia-based responses might be exposed to malicious forwarded headers if they are not behind a trusted proxy that ensures correctness of such headers, or if they don't have anything else in place to handle (and possibly discard) forwarded headers either in WebFlux or at the level of the underlying HTTP server.\n\nFor the application to be affected, it needs to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n  *  It needs to use the reactive web stack (Spring WebFlux) and Spring HATEOAS to create links in hypermedia-based responses.\n  *  The application infrastructure does not guard against clients submitting (X-)Forwarded\u2026\u00a0headers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34036", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbSpring HateoasVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.5cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_hateoas:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbSpring HateoasVersions  before (<) 1.5.5cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_hateoas:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbSpring Hateoas\u00bbVersion:2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_hateoas:2.1.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbSpring Hateoas\u00bbVersion:2.1.0UpdateMilestone1cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_hateoas:2.1.0:milestone1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbSpring Hateoas\u00bbVersion:2.1.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_hateoas:2.1.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-25  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-07-23  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-06-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-644 Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/644/Improper-Neutralization-of-HTTP-Headers-for-Scripting-Syntax.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34036", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-34036: Forwarded header exploit with Spring HATEOAS on WebFluxMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
