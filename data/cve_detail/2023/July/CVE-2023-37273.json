{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37273", "Description": "Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. Running Auto-GPT version prior to 0.4.3 by cloning the git repo and executing `docker compose run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml file from the one suggested in the official docker set up instructions. The docker-compose.yml file located in the repo root mounts itself into the docker container without write protection. This means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the `execute_python_file` and `execute_python_code` commands, it can overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse it to gain control of the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37273", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAgpt\u00bbAuto-gptVersions  before (<) 0.4.3cpe:2.3:a:agpt:auto-gpt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-x5gj-2chr-4ch6", "ref_desc": "Docker escape when running from docker-compose.yml included in git repo \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/4761", "ref_desc": "Prevent docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile from being written by erik-megarad \u00b7 Pull Request #4761 \u00b7 Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
