{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36826", "Description": "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version 8.21.0 and prior to version 23.5.2, an authenticated user can download a debug or artifact bundle from arbitrary organizations and projects with a known bundle ID. The user does not need to be a member of the organization or have permissions on the project. A patch was issued in version 23.5.2 to ensure authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to retrieve debug or artifact bundles. Authenticated users who do not have the necessary permissions on the particular project are no longer able to download them. Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. Self-Hosted Sentry users should upgrade to version 23.5.2 or higher.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36826", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSentry\u00bbSentryVersions  from including (>=) 8.21.0andbefore (<) 23.5.2cpe:2.3:a:sentry:sentry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-31  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-24  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/e932b15435bf36239431eaa3790a6bcfa47046a9", "ref_desc": "Restrict file downloads to Project (#49680) \u00b7 getsentry/sentry@e932b15 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-m4hc-m2v6-hfw8", "ref_desc": "Improper authorization on debug and artifact file downloads \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/49680", "ref_desc": "Restrict file downloads to Project by Swatinem \u00b7 Pull Request #49680 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
