{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37260", "Description": "league/oauth2-server is an implementation of an OAuth 2.0 authorization server written in PHP. Starting in version 8.3.2 and prior to version 8.5.3, servers that passed their keys to the CryptKey constructor as as string instead of a file path will have had that key included in a LogicException message if they did not provide a valid pass phrase for the key where required. This issue has been patched so that the provided key is no longer exposed in the exception message in the scenario outlined above. Users should upgrade to version 8.5.3 to receive the patch. As a workaround, pass the key as a file instead of a string.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37260", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nThephpleague\u00bbOauth2-serverVersions  from including (>=) 8.3.2andbefore (<) 8.5.3cpe:2.3:a:thephpleague:oauth2-server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-07  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-12  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-07-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server/pull/1353", "ref_desc": "Remove Key Leak by Sephster \u00b7 Pull Request #1353 \u00b7 thephpleague/oauth2-server \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server/releases/tag/8.5.3", "ref_desc": "Release 8.5.3 \u00b7 thephpleague/oauth2-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server/security/advisories/GHSA-wj7q-gjg8-3cpm", "ref_desc": "Key exposed in exception message when passing as a string and providing an invalid pass phrase \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 thephpleague/oauth2-server \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
