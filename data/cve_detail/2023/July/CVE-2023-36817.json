{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36817", "Description": "`tktchurch/website` contains the codebase for The King's Temple Church website. In version 0.1.0, a Stripe API key was found in the public code repository of the church's project. This sensitive information was unintentionally committed and subsequently exposed in the codebase. If an unauthorized party gains access to this key, they could potentially carry out transactions on behalf of the organization, leading to financial losses. Additionally, they could access sensitive customer information, leading to privacy violations and potential legal implications. The affected component is the codebase of our project, specifically the file(s) where the Stripe API key is embedded. The key should have been stored securely, and not committed to the codebase. The maintainers plan to revoke the leaked Stripe API key immediately, generate a new one, and not commit the key to the codebase.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36817", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nKingstemple\u00bbThe King's Temple Church Website\u00bbVersion:0.1.0cpe:2.3:a:kingstemple:the_king\\'s_temple_church_website:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-09  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-07-11  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tktchurch/website/security/advisories/GHSA-x3m6-5hmf-5x3w", "ref_desc": "Leaked Stripe API Key in Public Code Repository \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tktchurch/website \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
