{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38491", "Description": "Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites that might have potential attackers in the group of authenticated Panel users or that allow external visitors to upload an arbitrary file to the content folder. Kirby sites are not affected if they don't allow file uploads for untrusted users or visitors or if the file extensions of uploaded files are limited to a fixed safe list. The attack requires user interaction by another user or visitor and cannot be automated.\n\nAn editor with write access to the Kirby Panel could upload a file with an unknown file extension like `.xyz` that contains HTML code including harmful content like `<script>` tags. The direct link to that file could be sent to other users or visitors of the site. If the victim opened that link in a browser where they are logged in to Kirby and the file had not been opened by anyone since the upload, Kirby would not be able to send the correct MIME content type, instead falling back to `text/html`. The browser would then run the script, which could for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim.\n\nThe issue was caused by the underlying `Kirby\\Http\\Response::file()` method, which didn't have an explicit fallback if the MIME type could not be determined from the file extension. If you use this method in site or plugin code, these uses may be affected by the same vulnerability.\n\nThe problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have fixed the affected method to use a fallback MIME type of `text/plain` and set the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header if the MIME type of the file is unknown.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38491", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.6.0andbefore (<) 3.6.6.3cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.9.0andbefore (<) 3.9.6cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.8.0andbefore (<) 3.8.4.1cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.7.0andbefore (<) 3.7.5.2cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetkirby\u00bbKirbyVersions  from including (>=) 3.5.0andbefore (<) 3.5.8.3cpe:2.3:a:getkirby:kirby:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-31  0.19%  0.17%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-08-02  0.16%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-26  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-01  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-08-04  0.06%  0.17%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.3", "ref_desc": "Release 3.6.6.3 \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/H_NLPybjhxw--yTgwZMP23QjNwk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.2", "ref_desc": "Release 3.7.5.2 \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/k5IArY4yZjQVaNoZPa8U6zZZxq0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.3", "ref_desc": "Release 3.5.8.3 \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Tl01IhBc7T7JHjae0pTdFrFz30Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.6", "ref_desc": "Release 3.9.6 \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v9FuTqDMJP-6gD9TXhssJ8-cGYs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.4.1", "ref_desc": "Release 3.8.4.1 \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wi8fWXJ8VTudz6zlgo_eBM01eAE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/2f06ba1c026bc91cb0702bc16b7d505642536d15", "ref_desc": "Fix MIME detection vulnerability \u00b7 getkirby/kirby@2f06ba1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-8fv7-wq38-f5c9", "ref_desc": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) from MIME type auto-detection of uploaded files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getkirby/kirby \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
