{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34625", "Description": "ShowMojo MojoBox Digital Lockbox 1.4 is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass. The implementation of the lock opening mechanism via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is vulnerable to replay attacks. A malicious user is able to intercept BLE requests and replicate them to open the lock at any time. Alternatively, an attacker with physical access to the device on which the Android app is installed, can obtain the latest BLE messages via the app logs and use them for opening the lock.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34625", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShowmojo\u00bbMojobox Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.4cpe:2.3:o:showmojo:mojobox_firmware:1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Showmojo\u00bbMojobox\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-26  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-07-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://packetstormsecurity.com/2307-exploits/mojobox14-replay.txt", "ref_desc": "Files \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.whid.ninja/blog/mojobox-yet-another-not-so-smartlock", "ref_desc": "MojoBox: Yet-Another Not-So-SmartLockExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mandomat.github.io/2023-03-15-testing-mojobox-security/", "ref_desc": "MojoBox - yet another not so smartlockExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
