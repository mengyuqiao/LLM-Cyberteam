{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38499", "Description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Starting in version 9.4.0 and prior to versions 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30, and 12.4.4, in multi-site scenarios, enumerating the HTTP query parameters `id` and `L` allowed out-of-scope access to rendered content in the website frontend. For instance, this allowed visitors to access content of an internal site by adding handcrafted query parameters to the URL of a site that was publicly available. TYPO3 versions 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30, 12.4.4 fix the problem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38499", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.4.39cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.5.30cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andbefore (<) 12.4.4cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbTypo3Versions  from including (>=) 9.4.0andbefore (<) 9.5.42cpe:2.3:a:typo3:typo3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-31  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-003", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2023-003: Information Disclosure due to Out-of-scope Site ResolutionVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/702e2debd4b28f9cdb540544565fe6a8627ccb6a", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Avoid out-of-scope page access for non-matching site \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3@702e2de \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-jq6g-4v5m-wm9r", "ref_desc": "Information Disclosure due to Out-of-scope Site Resolution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/typo3 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
