{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37473", "Description": "zenstruck/collections is a set of helpers for iterating/paginating/filtering collections. Passing _callable strings_ (ie `system`) caused the function to be executed. This would result in a limited subset of specific user input being executed as if it were code. This issue has been addressed in commit `f4b1c48820` and included in release version 0.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is not passed to either `EntityRepository::find()` or `query()`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37473", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZenstruck\u00bbCollection\u00bbVersion:0.2.1cpe:2.3:a:zenstruck:collection:0.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-20  0.07%  0.15%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-06-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-20  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/security/advisories/GHSA-7xr2-8ff7-6fjq", "ref_desc": "Passing callable string to EntityRepository::find() and query() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zenstruck/collection \u00b7 GitHubMitigation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/commit/f4b1c488206e1b1581b06fcd331686846f13f19c", "ref_desc": "security(orm): prevent passing callable strings to `find()`/`query()` \u00b7 zenstruck/collection@f4b1c48 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/releases/tag/v0.2.1", "ref_desc": "Release v0.2.1 \u00b7 zenstruck/collection \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
