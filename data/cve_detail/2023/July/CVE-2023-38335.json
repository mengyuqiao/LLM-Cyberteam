{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38335", "Description": "Omnis Studio 10.22.00 has incorrect access control. It advertises a feature for making Omnis libraries \"always private\" - this is supposed to be an irreversible operation. However, due to implementation issues, \"always private\" Omnis libraries can be opened by the Omnis Studio browser by bypassing specific checks. This violates the expected behavior of an \"irreversible operation\".", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38335", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOmnis\u00bbStudio\u00bbVersion:10.22.00cpe:2.3:a:omnis:studio:10.22.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-21  0.44%  0.62%  +0.18 \n 2  2024-08-08  0.31%  0.44%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-07-26  0.21%  0.31%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-06-19  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-05-15  0.13%  0.18%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-08-01  0.05%  0.13%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-07-25  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/43", "ref_desc": "SecLists.Org Security Mailing List ArchiveNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/at1jXLmsEaQfH4pVRWiPdRAUo3o.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/41", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [SYSS-2023-005]: Omnis Studio - Expected Behavior Violation (CWE-440) (CVE-2023-38335)Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2023-005.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173695/Omnis-Studio-10.22.00-Library-Setting-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "Omnis Studio 10.22.00 Library Setting Bypass \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
