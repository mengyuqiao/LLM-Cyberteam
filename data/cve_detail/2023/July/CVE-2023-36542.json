{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36542", "Description": "Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0 include Processors and Controller Services that support HTTP URL references for retrieving drivers, which allows an authenticated and authorized user to configure a location that enables custom code execution. The resolution introduces a new Required Permission for referencing remote resources, restricting configuration of these components to privileged users. The permission prevents unprivileged users from configuring Processors and Controller Services annotated with the new Reference Remote Resources restriction. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.0 is the recommended mitigation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36542", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbNifiVersions  from including (>=) 0.0.2andup to, including, (<=) 1.22.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:nifi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.71% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.82%  0.71%  -0.12 \n 2  2024-08-17  0.83%  0.82%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-08-04  0.75%  0.83%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-07-10  0.26%  0.75%  +0.49 \n 5  2024-02-03  0.26%  0.26%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-08-04  0.05%  0.26%  +0.22 \n 7  2023-07-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/43", "ref_desc": "SecLists.Org Security Mailing List ArchiveNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/at1jXLmsEaQfH4pVRWiPdRAUo3o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2023-36542", "ref_desc": "Apache NiFi Security ReportsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/29/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-36542: Apache NiFi: Potential Code Injection with Properties Referencing Remote ResourcesMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/swnly3dzhhq9zo3rofc8djq77stkhbof", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-36542: Apache NiFi: Potential Code Injection with Properties Referencing Remote Resources-Apache Mail ArchivesIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
