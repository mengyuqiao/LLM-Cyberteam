{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34093", "Description": "Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to version 4.10.8, anyone (Strapi developers, users, plugins) can make every attribute of a Content-Type public without knowing it. The vulnerability only affects the handling of content types by Strapi, not the actual content types themselves. Users can use plugins or modify their own content types without realizing that the `privateAttributes` getter is being removed, which can result in any attribute becoming public. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed or the entire system being taken control of by an attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted, depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the users are mutating the content-type, they will not be affected. Version 4.10.8 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34093", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nStrapi\u00bbStrapiVersions  before (<) 4.10.8cpe:2.3:a:strapi:strapi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-31  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-24  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/commit/2fa8f30371bfd1db44c15e5747860ee5789096de", "ref_desc": "fix(content-types): remove getter for private attributes \u00b7 strapi/strapi@2fa8f30 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases/tag/v4.10.8", "ref_desc": "Release v4.10.8 \u00b7 strapi/strapi \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v9P0wNPip0w-6q-eb1wW853pdq4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/security/advisories/GHSA-chmr-rg2f-9jmf", "ref_desc": "Making all attributes on a content-type public via review workflows \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 strapi/strapi \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
