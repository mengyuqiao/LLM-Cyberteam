{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37460", "Description": "Plexis Archiver is a collection of Plexus components to create archives or extract archives to a directory with a unified `Archiver`/`UnArchiver` API. Prior to version 4.8.0, using AbstractUnArchiver for extracting an archive might lead to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. When extracting an archive with an entry that already exists in the destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist - the `resolveFile()` function will return the symlink's source instead of its target, which will pass the verification that ensures the file will not be extracted outside of the destination directory. Later `Files.newOutputStream()`, that follows symlinks by default,  will actually write the entry's content to the symlink's target. Whoever uses plexus archiver to extract an untrusted archive is vulnerable to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. Version 4.8.0 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37460", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCodehaus-plexus\u00bbPlexus-archiverVersions  before (<) 4.8.0cpe:2.3:a:codehaus-plexus:plexus-archiver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-16  1.25%  1.36%  +0.11 \n 2  2024-08-26  1.16%  1.25%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-07-31  0.60%  1.16%  +0.56 \n 4  2024-07-20  0.46%  0.60%  +0.14 \n 5  2024-06-24  0.45%  0.46%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-05-31  0.40%  0.45%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-08-04  0.07%  0.40%  +0.34 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/61/UNIX-Symbolic-Link-Symlink-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/security/advisories/GHSA-wh3p-fphp-9h2m", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Creation in AbstractUnArchiver \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/releases/tag/plexus-archiver-4.8.0", "ref_desc": "Release 4.8.0 \u00b7 codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/commit/54759839fbdf85caf8442076f001d5fd64e0dcb2", "ref_desc": "Avoid override target symlink by standard file in AbstractUnArchiver \u00b7 codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver@5475983 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
