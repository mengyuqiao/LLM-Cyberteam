{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36266", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Keeper Password Manager for Desktop version 16.10.2, and the KeeperFill Browser Extensions version 16.5.4, allows local attackers to gain sensitive information via plaintext password storage in memory after the user is already logged in, and may persist after logout. NOTE: the vendor disputes this for two reasons: the information is inherently available during a logged-in session when the attacker can read from arbitrary memory locations, and information only remains available after logout because of memory-management limitations of web browsers (not because the Keeper technology itself is retaining the information).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36266", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKeepersecurity\u00bbKeeper\u00bbVersion:16.10.2cpe:2.3:a:keepersecurity:keeper:16.10.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nKeepersecurity\u00bbKeeperfill\u00bbVersion:16.5.4cpe:2.3:a:keepersecurity:keeperfill:16.5.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173809/Keeper-Security-Desktop-16.10.2-Browser-Extension-16.5.4-Password-Dumper.html", "ref_desc": "Keeper Security Desktop 16.10.2 / Browser Extension 16.5.4 Password Dumper \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://harkenzo.tlstickle.com/2023-06-12-Keeper-Password-Dumping/", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
