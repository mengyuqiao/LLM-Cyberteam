{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38496", "Description": "Apptainer is an open source container platform. Version 1.2.0-rc.2 introduced an ineffective privilege drop when requesting container network setup, therefore subsequent functions are called with root privileges, the attack surface is rather limited for users but an attacker could possibly craft a starter config to delete any directory on the host filesystems. A security fix has been included in Apptainer 1.2.1. There is no known workaround outside of upgrading to Apptainer 1.2.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38496", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLfprojects\u00bbApptainer\u00bbVersion:1.2.0ForGOcpe:2.3:a:lfprojects:apptainer:1.2.0:-:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions\nLfprojects\u00bbApptainer\u00bbVersion:1.2.0UpdateRC2ForGOcpe:2.3:a:lfprojects:apptainer:1.2.0:rc2:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-08-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-271 Privilege Dropping / Lowering Errors", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/271/Privilege-Dropping-Lowering-Errors.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/pull/1523", "ref_desc": "Set real UID to zero when escalating privileges for CNI plugins to fix issue appeared with RHEL 9.X (release 1.2) by cclerget \u00b7 Pull Request #1523 \u00b7 apptainer/apptainer \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/pull/1578", "ref_desc": "Restore old syscall setresuid behavior when escalating/dropping privileges. by cclerget \u00b7 Pull Request #1578 \u00b7 apptainer/apptainer \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/security/advisories/GHSA-mmx5-32m4-wxvx", "ref_desc": "Ineffective privileges drop when requesting container network \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 apptainer/apptainer \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
