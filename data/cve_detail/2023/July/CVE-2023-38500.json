{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38500", "Description": "TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to provide cross-site-scripting-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2, due to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer. Versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2 fix the problem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38500", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTypo3\u00bbHtml SanitizerVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.5.1cpe:2.3:a:typo3:html_sanitizer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTypo3\u00bbHtml SanitizerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:typo3:html_sanitizer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-07-31  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-24  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-03  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-002", "ref_desc": "TYPO3-CORE-SA-2023-002: By-passing Cross-Site Scripting Protection in HTML SanitizerVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/commit/e3026f589fef0be8c3574ee3f0a0bfbe33d7ebdb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-59jf-3q9v-rh6g \u00b7 TYPO3/html-sanitizer@e3026f5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-59jf-3q9v-rh6g", "ref_desc": "By-passing Cross-Site Scripting Protection in HTML Sanitizer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TYPO3/html-sanitizer \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
