{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37266", "Description": "CasaOS is an open-source Personal Cloud system. Unauthenticated attackers can craft arbitrary JWTs and access features that usually require authentication and execute arbitrary commands as `root` on CasaOS instances. This problem was addressed by improving the validation of JWTs in commit `705bf1f`. This patch is part of CasaOS 0.4.4. Users should upgrade to CasaOS 0.4.4. If they can't, they should temporarily restrict access to CasaOS to untrusted users, for instance by not exposing it publicly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37266", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nIcewhale\u00bbCasaosVersions  before (<) 0.4.4cpe:2.3:o:icewhale:casaos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.65% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-08  3.26%  3.65%  +0.39 \n 2  2024-09-25  3.46%  3.26%  -0.20 \n 3  2024-08-18  3.11%  3.46%  +0.34 \n 4  2024-07-23  3.65%  3.11%  -0.54 \n 5  2024-06-16  3.34%  3.65%  +0.31 \n 6  2024-06-05  3.24%  3.34%  +0.10 \n 7  2024-04-30  5.23%  3.24%  -1.99 \n 8  2024-04-19  7.03%  5.23%  -1.81 \n 9  2024-04-06  9.62%  7.03%  -2.58 \n 10  2024-03-28  11.11%  9.62%  -1.49 \n 11  2024-03-15  11.24%  11.11%  -0.13 \n 12  2024-03-04  10.30%  11.24%  +0.94 \n 13  2024-02-23  9.96%  10.30%  +0.34 \n 14  2024-02-10  7.29%  9.96%  +2.67 \n 15  2024-01-22  5.60%  7.29%  +1.69 \n 16  2023-12-28  6.25%  5.60%  -0.65 \n 17  2023-11-01  5.08%  6.25%  +1.16 \n 18  2023-09-21  6.74%  5.08%  -1.66 \n 19  2023-08-26  6.72%  6.74%  +0.02 \n 20  2023-07-28  0.10%  6.72%  +6.63 \n 21  2023-07-27  0.04%  0.10%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS/commit/705bf1facbffd2ca40b159b0303132b6fdf657ad", "ref_desc": "Update jwt (#1025) \u00b7 IceWhaleTech/CasaOS@705bf1f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-m5q5-8mfw-p2hr", "ref_desc": "Weak JWT secrets \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 IceWhaleTech/CasaOS \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
