{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37471", "Description": "Open Access Management (OpenAM) is an access management solution that includes Authentication, SSO, Authorization, Federation, Entitlements and Web Services Security. OpenAM up to version 14.7.2 does not properly validate the signature of SAML responses received as part of the SAMLv1.x Single Sign-On process. Attackers can use this fact to impersonate any OpenAM user, including the administrator, by sending a specially crafted SAML response to the SAMLPOSTProfileServlet servlet. This problem has been patched in  OpenAM 14.7.3-SNAPSHOT and later. User unable to upgrade should comment servlet `SAMLPOSTProfileServlet` from their pom file. See the linked GHSA for details.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37471", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOpenidentityplatform\u00bbOpenamVersions  before (<) 14.7.3cpe:2.3:a:openidentityplatform:openam:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-21  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-26  0.08%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-06-19  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-01  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/security/advisories/GHSA-4mh8-9wq6-rjxg", "ref_desc": "User impersonation using SAMLv1.x SSO process. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/pull/624", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-143, GHSL-2023-144, deny unsigned SAML response by maximthomas \u00b7 Pull Request #624 \u00b7 OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/commit/7c18543d126e8a567b83bb4535631825aaa9d742", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-143, GHSL-2023-144, deny unsigned SAML response (#624) \u00b7 OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM@7c18543 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
