{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24823", "Description": "RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a type confusion between IPv6 extension headers and a UDP header. This occurs while encoding a 6LoWPAN IPHC header. The type confusion manifests in an out of bounds write in the packet buffer. The overflow can be used to corrupt other packets and the allocator metadata. Corrupting a pointer will easily lead to denial of service. While carefully manipulating the allocator metadata gives an attacker the possibility to write data to arbitrary locations and thus execute arbitrary code. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, apply the patches manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24823", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRiot-os\u00bbRiotVersions  before (<) 2022.10cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.23%  0.26%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-14  0.24%  0.23%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-10-04  0.22%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-26  0.18%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-04-30  0.08%  0.18%  +0.10 \n 6  2024-03-24  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 7  2023-05-04  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/843/Access-of-Resource-Using-Incompatible-Type-Type-Confusion-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/dafc397fdc3655aeb5c7b9963a43f1604c6a2062", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes [backport 2022.10] by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18820 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-jwmv-47p2-hgq2", "ref_desc": "Packet Type Confusion during IPHC send \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/4a081f86616cb5c9dd0b5d7b286da03285d1652a", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18817 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
