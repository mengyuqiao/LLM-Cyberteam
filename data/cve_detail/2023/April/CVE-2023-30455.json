{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30455", "Description": "An issue was discovered in ebankIT before 7. A Denial-of-Service attack is possible through the GET parameter EStatementsIds located on the /Controls/Generic/EBMK/Handlers/EStatements/DownloadEStatement.ashx endpoint. The GET parameter accepts over 100 comma-separated e-statement IDs without throwing an error. When this many IDs are supplied, the server takes around 60 seconds to respond and successfully generate the expected ZIP archive (during this time period, no other pages load). A threat actor could issue a request to this endpoint with 100+ statement IDs every 30 seconds, potentially resulting in an overload of the server for all users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30455", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nEbankit\u00bbEbankitVersions  before (<) 7.0cpe:2.3:a:ebankit:ebankit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-08  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-30  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-04  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-03-28  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172064/ebankIT-6-Denial-Of-Service.html", "ref_desc": "ebankIT 6 Denial Of Service \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.ebankit.com/blog-press", "ref_desc": "News & Press | ebankITProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RnMnAZ1XTQ37WcoeOaERV9lG0Mw.html"}]}
