{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29000", "Description": "The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server. Starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 3.7.0, by trusting that the server will return a certificate that belongs to the keypair of the user, a malicious server could get the desktop client to encrypt files with a key known to the attacker. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop 3.7.0. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29000", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbDesktopVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.7.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-14  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-06  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-10  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-04-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-h82x-98q3-7534", "ref_desc": "Desktop client does not verify received singed certificate in end-to-end encryption \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/4949", "ref_desc": "validate certificate for E2EE against private key by mgallien \u00b7 Pull Request #4949 \u00b7 nextcloud/desktop \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1679267", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
