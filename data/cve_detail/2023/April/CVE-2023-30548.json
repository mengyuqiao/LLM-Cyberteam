{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30548", "Description": "gatsby-plugin-sharp is a plugin for the gatsby framework which exposes functions built on the Sharp image processing library. The gatsby-plugin-sharp plugin prior to versions 5.8.1 and 4.25.1 contains a path traversal vulnerability exposed when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`). It should be noted that by default gatsby develop is only accessible via the localhost 127.0.0.1, and one would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as --host 0.0.0.0, -H 0.0.0.0, or the GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0 environment variable. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability will have read access to all files within the scope of the server process. A patch has been introduced in gatsby-plugin-sharp@5.8.1 and gatsby-plugin-sharp@4.25.1 which mitigates the issue by ensuring that included paths remain within the project directory. As stated above, by default gatsby develop is only exposed to the localhost 127.0.0.1. For those using the develop server in the default configuration no risk is posed. If other ranges are required, preventing the develop server from being exposed to untrusted interfaces or IP address ranges would mitigate the risk from this vulnerability. Users are non the less encouraged to upgrade to a safe version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30548", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGatsbyjs\u00bbGatsby\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.8.1cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nGatsbyjs\u00bbGatsby\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.25.1cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-23  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/dcf88ed01df2c26e0c93a41e1a2a840076d8247e", "ref_desc": "fix(gatsby-plugin-sharp): don't serve static assets that are not resu\u2026 \u00b7 gatsbyjs/gatsby@dcf88ed \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/security/advisories/GHSA-h2pm-378c-pcxx", "ref_desc": "Path traversal vulnerability exposed by Gatsby develop server in gatsby-plugin-sharp \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gatsbyjs/gatsby \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/5f442081b227cc0879babb96858f970c4ce94c6b", "ref_desc": "fix(gatsby-plugin-sharp): don't serve static assets that are not resu\u2026 \u00b7 gatsbyjs/gatsby@5f44208 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
