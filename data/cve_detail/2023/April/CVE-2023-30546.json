{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30546", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an operating system for Internet of Things devices. An off-by-one error can be triggered in the Antelope database management system in the Contiki-NG operating system in versions 4.8 and prior. The problem exists in the Contiki File System (CFS) backend for the storage of data (file os/storage/antelope/storage-cfs.c). In the functions `storage_get_index` and `storage_put_index`, a buffer for merging two strings is allocated with one byte less than the maximum size of the merged strings, causing subsequent function calls to the cfs_open function to read from memory beyond the buffer size. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in the next release. As a workaround, the problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2425.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30546", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-06  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-28  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-02  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-10  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-193 Off-by-one Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/193/Off-by-one-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2425", "ref_desc": "antelope,storage-cfs: Fix length of filename array by szsam \u00b7 Pull Request #2425 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-257g-w39m-5jj4", "ref_desc": "Off-by-one error in Antelope DBMS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
