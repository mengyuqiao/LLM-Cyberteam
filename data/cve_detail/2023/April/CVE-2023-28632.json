{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28632", "Description": "GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 0.83 and prior to versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7, an authenticated user can modify emails of any user, and can therefore takeover another user account through the \"forgotten password\" feature. By modifying emails, the user can also receive sensitive data through GLPI notifications. Versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, account takeover can be prevented by deactivating all notifications related to `Forgotten password?` event. However, it will not prevent unauthorized modification of any user emails.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28632", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpiVersions  from including (>=) 0.83andbefore (<) 9.5.13cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpiVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.0.7cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-26  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-15  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2024-04-11  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-03-05  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-04-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/tag/10.0.7", "ref_desc": "Release 10.0.7 \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NK4GCLtZ0At5J5JjXoSnFy3dfRo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/tag/9.5.13", "ref_desc": "Patch;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tI_xo7qylZ5sJKOuIGtR3yml_rg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-7pwm-pg76-3q9x", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
