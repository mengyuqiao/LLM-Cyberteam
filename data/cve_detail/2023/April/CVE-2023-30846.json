{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30846", "Description": "typed-rest-client is a library for Node Rest and Http Clients with typings for use with TypeScript. Users of the typed-rest-client library version 1.7.3 or lower are vulnerable to leak authentication data to 3rd parties. The flow of the vulnerability is as follows: First, send any request with `BasicCredentialHandler`, `BearerCredentialHandler` or `PersonalAccessTokenCredentialHandler`. Second, the target host may return a redirection (3xx), with a link to a second host. Third, the next request will use the credentials to authenticate with the second host, by setting the `Authorization` header. The expected behavior is that the next request will *NOT* set the `Authorization` header. The problem was fixed in version 1.8.0. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30846", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbTyped-rest-client\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.8.0cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:typed-rest-client:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.27%  0.33%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-19  0.31%  0.27%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-10-06  0.31%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-08-27  0.29%  0.31%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-07-05  0.29%  0.29%  0.00 \n 6  2024-05-28  0.24%  0.29%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-05-02  0.28%  0.24%  -0.04 \n 8  2024-04-07  0.26%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 9  2024-03-26  0.23%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 10  2024-03-15  0.23%  0.23%  0.00 \n 11  2024-03-02  0.20%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 12  2024-02-20  0.25%  0.20%  -0.05 \n 13  2024-01-28  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 14  2023-12-03  0.20%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 15  2023-11-20  0.20%  0.20%  -0.01 \n 16  2023-08-29  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 17  2023-08-11  0.10%  0.18%  +0.08 \n 18  2023-07-09  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 19  2023-07-08  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 20  2023-06-02  0.09%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 21  2023-05-29  0.10%  0.09%  0.00 \n 22  2023-05-08  0.12%  0.10%  -0.03 \n 23  2023-05-06  0.04%  0.12%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/security/advisories/GHSA-558p-m34m-vpmq", "ref_desc": "Potential leak of authentication data to 3rd parties \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 microsoft/typed-rest-client \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/commit/f9ff755631b982ee1303dfc3e3c823d0d31233e8", "ref_desc": "Disable authentications on redirections (#207) \u00b7 microsoft/typed-rest-client@f9ff755 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230601-0008/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-30846 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
