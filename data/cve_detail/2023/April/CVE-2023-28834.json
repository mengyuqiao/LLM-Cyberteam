{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28834", "Description": "Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Nextcloud Server 24.0.0 until 24.0.6 and 25.0.0 until 25.0.4, as well as Nextcloud Enterprise Server 23.0.0 until 23.0.11, 24.0.0 until 24.0.6, and 25.0.0 until 25.0.4, have an information disclosure vulnerability. A user was able to get the full data directory path of the Nextcloud server from an API endpoint. By itself this information is not problematic as it can also be guessed for most common setups, but it could speed up other unknown attacks in the future if the information is known. Nextcloud Server 24.0.6 and 25.0.4 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 23.0.11, 24.0.6, and 25.0.4 contain patches for this issue. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28834", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.0andbefore (<) 25.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.10cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.10cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 23.0.0andbefore (<) 23.0.14cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.0andbefore (<) 25.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-24  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-09  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-212 Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/212/Improper-Removal-of-Sensitive-Information-Before-Storage-or-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1690510", "ref_desc": "HackerOneExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-5w64-6c42-rgcv", "ref_desc": "Full path of data directory exposed to users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/33883", "ref_desc": "[Bug]: the complete server installation path is visible in cloud/user endpoint \u00b7 Issue #33883 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/36094", "ref_desc": "Only expose storage location to admins by PVince81 \u00b7 Pull Request #36094 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
