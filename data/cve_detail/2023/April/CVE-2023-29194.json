{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29194", "Description": "Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. Users can either intentionally or inadvertently create a keyspace containing `/` characters such that from that point on, anyone who tries to view keyspaces from VTAdmin will receive an error. Trying to list all the keyspaces using `vtctldclient GetKeyspaces` will also return an error. Note that all other keyspaces can still be administered using the CLI (vtctldclient). This issue is fixed in version 16.0.1. As a workaround, delete the offending keyspace using a CLI client (vtctldclient).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29194", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbVitessVersions  before (<) 16.0.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:vitess:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-04  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-14  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-04-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/703/Improper-Check-or-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/security/advisories/GHSA-735r-hv67-g38f", "ref_desc": "Users that can create keyspaces can deny access to already existing keyspaces \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vitessio/vitess \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commits/v0.16.1/", "ref_desc": "Commits \u00b7 vitessio/vitess \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commit/adf10196760ad0b3991a7aa7a8580a544e6ddf88", "ref_desc": "[Backport] Update topo {Get,Create}Keyspace to prevent invalid keyspa\u2026 \u00b7 vitessio/vitess@adf1019 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
