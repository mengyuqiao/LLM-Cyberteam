{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30614", "Description": "Pay is a payments engine for Ruby on Rails 6.0 and higher. In versions prior to 6.3.2 a payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site scripting. An attacker could create a working URL that renders a javascript link to a user on a Rails application that integrates Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target certain individuals. If the targeted application contains a functionality to submit user-generated content (such as comments) the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality. This has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30614", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPay Project\u00bbPAY\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 6.3.2cpe:2.3:a:pay_project:pay:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-29  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-21  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-19  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pay-rails/pay/security/advisories/GHSA-cqf3-vpx7-rxhw", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) in pay \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pay-rails/pay \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pay-rails/pay/commit/5d6283a24062bd272a524ec48415f536a67ad57f", "ref_desc": "Fix XSS vulnerability on Stripe payment page \u00b7 pay-rails/pay@5d6283a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
