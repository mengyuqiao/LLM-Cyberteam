{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29523", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any user who can edit their own user profile can execute arbitrary script macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents. The same vulnerability can also be exploited in other contexts where the `display` method on a document is used to display a field with wiki syntax, for example in applications created using `App Within Minutes`. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.8, 14.10.2 and 15.0RC1. There is no workaround apart from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29523", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  before (<) 13.10.11cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.4.8cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.5andbefore (<) 14.10.2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.81% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-23  0.66%  0.81%  +0.15 \n 2  2024-11-08  0.64%  0.66%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-24  0.53%  0.64%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-03-18  0.46%  0.53%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-05-02  0.06%  0.46%  +0.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20327", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20327] Privilege escalation (PR) from account through XWiki syntax injection in cleaned HTML macro - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/0d547181389f7941e53291af940966413823f61c", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-20327: Escape closing HTML macro in XWikiDocument#display \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@0d54718 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-x764-ff8r-9hpx", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') in display method used in user profiles \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/App%20Within%20Minutes%20Application", "ref_desc": "App Within Minutes Application (XWiki.org)Product", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
