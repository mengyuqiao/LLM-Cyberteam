{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29010", "Description": "Budibase is a low code platform for creating internal tools, workflows, and admin panels. Versions prior to 2.4.3 (07 March 2023) are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery. This can lead to an attacker gaining access to a Budibase AWS secret key. Users of Budibase cloud need to take no action. Self-host users who run Budibase on the public internet and are using a cloud provider that allows HTTP access to metadata information should ensure that when they deploy Budibase live, their internal metadata endpoint is not exposed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29010", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nBudibase\u00bbBudibaseVersions  before (<) 2.4.3cpe:2.3:a:budibase:budibase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-27  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-16  0.12%  0.11%  0.00 \n 3  2024-04-12  0.08%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-03-06  0.06%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-04-15  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/security/advisories/GHSA-9xg2-9mcv-985p", "ref_desc": "[ Vulnerability Report ] SSRF - BudiBase \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Budibase/budibase \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/commits/develop?after=93d6939466aec192043d8ac842e754f65fdf2e8a+594&branch=develop&qualified_name=refs%2Fheads%2Fdevelop", "ref_desc": "Commits \u00b7 Budibase/budibase \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Budibase/budibase/releases/tag/v2.4.3", "ref_desc": "Release v2.4.3 \u00b7 Budibase/budibase \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
