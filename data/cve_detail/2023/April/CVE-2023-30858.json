{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30858", "Description": "The Denosaurs emoji package provides emojis for dinosaurs. Starting in version 0.1.0 and prior to version 0.3.0, the reTrimSpace regex has 2nd degree polynomial inefficiency, leading to a delayed response given a big payload. The issue has been patched in 0.3.0. As a workaround, avoid using the `replace`, `unemojify`, or `strip` functions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30858", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDenosaurs\u00bbEmojiVersions  from including (>=) 0.1.0andbefore (<) 0.3.0cpe:2.3:a:denosaurs:emoji:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-08  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-30  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-04  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-03-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denosaurs/emoji/security/advisories/GHSA-w2xx-hjhp-gx5v", "ref_desc": "ReDoS vulnerability in `replace` function \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denosaurs/emoji \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denosaurs/emoji/pull/11", "ref_desc": "fix: remove `reTrimSpace` in favor of `trim` by eliassjogreen \u00b7 Pull Request #11 \u00b7 denosaurs/emoji \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/444f2255-5085-466f-ba0e-5549fa8846a3/", "ref_desc": "ReDoS vulnerability in `strip` function vulnerability found in emojiExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
