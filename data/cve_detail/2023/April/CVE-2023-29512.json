{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29512", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any user with edit rights on a page (e.g., it's own user page), can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of the information loaded from attachments in `imported.vm`, `importinline.vm`, and `packagelist.vm`. This page is installed by default. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.1, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29512", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.5andbefore (<) 14.10.1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  before (<) 13.10.11cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.4.8cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-23  0.19%  0.24%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-11-08  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-24  0.10%  0.17%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-03-18  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-23  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-29  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20267", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20267] Privilege escalation (PR) from account through AdminImportSheet/importinline.vm - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-hg5x-3w3x-7g96", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') in xwiki-platform-web-templates \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e4bbdc23fea0be4ef1921d1a58648028ce753344", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-20267: Improved escaping in importinline.vm \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@e4bbdc2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
