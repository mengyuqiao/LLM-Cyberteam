{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24538", "Description": "Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24538", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGolang\u00bbGOVersions  before (<) 1.19.8cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGolang\u00bbGOVersions  from including (>=) 1.20.0andbefore (<) 1.20.3cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.86% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  0.74%  0.86%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-11-11  0.64%  0.74%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-10-27  0.65%  0.64%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-09-16  0.55%  0.65%  +0.10 \n 5  2024-07-11  0.34%  0.55%  +0.21 \n 6  2024-05-08  0.29%  0.34%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-04-12  0.12%  0.29%  +0.17 \n 8  2024-03-06  0.08%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-12-26  0.12%  0.08%  -0.04 \n 10  2023-12-17  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 11  2023-04-18  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1703", "ref_desc": "GO-2023-1703 - Go PackagesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://go.dev/issue/59234", "ref_desc": "html/template: backticks not treated as string delimiters (CVE-2023-24538) \u00b7 Issue #59234 \u00b7 golang/go \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://go.dev/cl/482079", "ref_desc": "html/template: disallow actions in JS template literals (482079) \u00b7 Gerrit Code ReviewPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09", "ref_desc": "Go: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202311-09) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/p0S2LtT_x1kmcmHYI6CuiiC_cDA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8", "ref_desc": "[security] Go 1.20.3 and Go 1.19.8 are releasedMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RWU9YNPtPKwUYnyTd9WeWl4RVRI.html"}]}
