{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30620", "Description": "mindsdb is a Machine Learning platform to help developers build AI solutions. In affected versions an unsafe extraction is being performed using `tarfile.extractall()` from a remotely retrieved tarball. Which may lead to the writing of the extracted files to an unintended location. Sometimes, the vulnerability is called a TarSlip or a ZipSlip variant. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to overwrite any local file which the server process has access to. There is no risk of file exposure with this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in release `23.2.1.0 `. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30620", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nMindsdb\u00bbMindsdbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 23.1.5.0cpe:2.3:a:mindsdb:mindsdb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.14%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-01  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-27  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-03-21  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-02-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/commit/4419b0f0019c000db390b54d8b9d06e1d3670039", "ref_desc": "Use safe extract to prevent CVE-2007-4559 bug \u00b7 mindsdb/mindsdb@4419b0f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/security/advisories/GHSA-2g5w-29q9-w6hx", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary File Write when Extracting a Remotely retrieved Tarball using `Tarfile.extractall()` in mindsdb/mindsdb \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mindsdb/mindsdb \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/releases/tag/v23.2.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release v23.2.1.0 \u00b7 mindsdb/mindsdb \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
