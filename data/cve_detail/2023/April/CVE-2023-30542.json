{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30542", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The proposal creation entrypoint (`propose`) in `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` allows the creation of proposals with a `signatures` array shorter than the `calldatas` array. This causes the additional elements of the latter to be ignored, and if the proposal succeeds the corresponding actions would eventually execute without any calldata. The `ProposalCreated` event correctly represents what will eventually execute, but the proposal parameters as queried through `getActions` appear to respect the original intended calldata. This issue has been patched in 4.8.3. As a workaround, ensure that all proposals that pass through governance have equal length `signatures` and `calldatas` parameters.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30542", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.3.0andbefore (<) 4.8.3cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts Upgradeable\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.3.0andbefore (<) 4.8.3cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts_upgradeable:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-06  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-26  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-22  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-03-16  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-18  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-04-28  0.04%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.8.3", "ref_desc": "Release v4.8.3 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HbjGnGmcD0NUu9Xz40BlWs-PdvY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-93hq-5wgc-jc82", "ref_desc": "GovernorCompatibilityBravo may trim proposal calldata \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
