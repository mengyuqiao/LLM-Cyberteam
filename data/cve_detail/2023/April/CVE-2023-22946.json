{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22946", "Description": "In Apache Spark versions prior to 3.4.0, applications using spark-submit can specify a 'proxy-user' to run as, limiting privileges. The application can execute code with the privileges of the submitting user, however, by providing malicious configuration-related classes on the classpath. This affects architectures relying on proxy-user, for example those using Apache Livy to manage submitted applications.\n\nUpdate to Apache Spark 3.4.0 or later, and ensure that \nspark.submit.proxyUser.allowCustomClasspathInClusterMode is set to its \ndefault of \"false\", and is not overridden by submitted applications.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22946", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSparkVersions  before (<) 3.4.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:spark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-27  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-08-04  0.10%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-05-06  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 5  2024-04-23  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.08%  0.05%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-05-08  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-04-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/yllfl25xh5tbotjmg93zrq4bzwhqc0gv", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-22946: Apache Spark proxy-user privilege escalation from malicious configuration class-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
