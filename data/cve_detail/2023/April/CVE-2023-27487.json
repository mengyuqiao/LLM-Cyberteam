{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27487", "Description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, the client may bypass JSON Web Token (JWT) checks and forge fake original paths. The header `x-envoy-original-path` should be an internal header, but Envoy does not remove this header from the request at the beginning of request processing when it is sent from an untrusted client. The faked header would then be used for trace logs and grpc logs, as well as used in the URL used for `jwt_authn` checks if the `jwt_authn` filter is used, and any other upstream use of the x-envoy-original-path header. Attackers may forge a trusted `x-envoy-original-path` header. Versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9 have patches for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27487", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.23.0andbefore (<) 1.23.6cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.25.0andbefore (<) 1.25.3cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.24.0andbefore (<) 1.24.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.22.9cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.18%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-14  0.17%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-06  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-10  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-03-04  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-06  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-04-12  0.04%  0.12%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-5375-pq35-hf2g", "ref_desc": "Client may fake the header `x-envoy-original-path` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
