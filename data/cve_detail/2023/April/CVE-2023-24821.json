{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24821", "Description": "RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a large out of bounds write beyond the packet buffer. The write will create a hard fault exception after reaching the last page of RAM. The hard fault is not handled and the system will be stuck until reset, thus the impact is denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, disable support for fragmented IP datagrams or apply the patches manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24821", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRiot-os\u00bbRiotVersions  before (<) 2022.10cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-14  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-04  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-26  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-30  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-05-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/9728f727e75d7d78dbfb5918e0de1b938b7b6d2c", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18817 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-2fpr-82xr-p887", "ref_desc": "Integer Underflow during defragmentation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/bd31010231f5340e21410595dd95afc86bbfd341", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes [backport 2022.10] by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18820 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
