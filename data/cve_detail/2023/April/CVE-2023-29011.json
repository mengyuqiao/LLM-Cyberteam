{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29011", "Description": "Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, ships with an executable called `connect.exe`, which implements a SOCKS5 proxy that can be used to connect e.g. to SSH servers via proxies when certain ports are blocked for outgoing connections. The location of `connect.exe`'s config file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be interpreted as `C:\\etc\\connectrc`. Since `C:\\etc` can be created by any authenticated user, this makes `connect.exe` susceptible to malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-user machine. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, create the folder `etc` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders. Alternatively, watch out for malicious `<drive>:\\etc\\connectrc` files on multi-user machines.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29011", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGit For Windows Project\u00bbGit For WindowsVersions  before (<) 2.40.1cpe:2.3:a:git_for_windows_project:git_for_windows:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-27  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1", "ref_desc": "Release Git for Windows 2.40.1 \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-F6mmLdTld1Ck-sXU6czD_wKEyw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-g4fv-xjqw-q7jm", "ref_desc": "The config file of `connect.exe` is susceptible to malicious placing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
