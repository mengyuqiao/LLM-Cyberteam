{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30856", "Description": "eDEX-UI is a science fiction terminal emulator. Versions 2.2.8 and prior are vulnerable to cross-site websocket hijacking. When running eDEX-UI and browsing the web, a malicious website can connect to eDEX's internal terminal control websocket, and send arbitrary commands to the shell. The project has been archived since 2021, and as of time of publication there are no plans to patch this issue and release a new version. Some workarounds are available, including shutting down eDEX-UI when browsing the web and ensuring the eDEX terminal runs with lowest possible privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30856", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEdex-ui Project\u00bbEdex-uiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.8cpe:2.3:a:edex-ui_project:edex-ui:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.19%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-08  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-30  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-04  0.08%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-03-28  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 6  2023-05-11  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-346 Origin Validation Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/346/Origin-Validation-Error.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1385 Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1385/Missing-Origin-Validation-in-WebSockets.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-q8xc-f2wf-ffh9", "ref_desc": "Cross-site websocket hijacking enables remote command execution (RCE) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 GitSquared/edex-ui \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://christian-schneider.net/CrossSiteWebSocketHijacking.html", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)Technical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/blob/04a00c4079908788b371c6ecdefff96d0d9950f8/src/classes/terminal.class.js#L458", "ref_desc": "edex-ui/terminal.class.js at 04a00c4079908788b371c6ecdefff96d0d9950f8 \u00b7 GitSquared/edex-ui \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
