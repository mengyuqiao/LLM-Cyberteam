{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29017", "Description": "vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules. Prior to version 3.9.15, vm2 was not properly handling host objects passed to `Error.prepareStackTrace` in case of unhandled async errors. A threat actor could bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version 3.9.15 of vm2. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29017", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nVm2 Project\u00bbVM2\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.9.15cpe:2.3:a:vm2_project:vm2:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  2.38%  4.34%  +1.95 \n 2  2024-11-11  1.94%  2.38%  +0.44 \n 3  2024-10-27  1.91%  1.94%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-09-16  1.71%  1.91%  +0.21 \n 5  2024-06-28  1.40%  1.71%  +0.31 \n 6  2024-05-08  1.48%  1.40%  -0.08 \n 7  2024-04-12  1.07%  1.48%  +0.41 \n 8  2024-04-01  0.83%  1.07%  +0.24 \n 9  2024-03-06  0.71%  0.83%  +0.11 \n 10  2023-12-29  0.81%  0.71%  -0.10 \n 11  2023-10-31  1.11%  0.81%  -0.30 \n 12  2023-08-09  1.05%  1.11%  +0.07 \n 13  2023-07-09  0.92%  1.05%  +0.13 \n 14  2023-07-08  1.76%  0.92%  -0.84 \n 15  2023-06-08  2.47%  1.76%  -0.71 \n 16  2023-05-08  0.64%  2.47%  +1.83 \n 17  2023-04-14  0.08%  0.64%  +0.56 \n 18  2023-04-11  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-913 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/913/Improper-Control-of-Dynamically-Managed-Code-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/seongil-wi/2a44e082001b959bfe304b62121fb76d", "ref_desc": "vm2_3.9.14_exploit_1.js \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-7jxr-cg7f-gpgv", "ref_desc": "Sandbox Escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/issues/515", "ref_desc": "[VM2 Sandbox Escape] Vulnerability in vm2@3.9.14 \u00b7 Issue #515 \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/d534e5785f38307b70d3aac1945260a261a94d50", "ref_desc": "Wrap host objects passes through prepareStackTrace \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2@d534e57 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
