{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27493", "Description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, Envoy does not sanitize or escape request properties when generating request headers. This can lead to characters that are illegal in header values to be sent to the upstream service. In the worst case, it can cause upstream service to interpret the original request as two pipelined requests, possibly bypassing the intent of Envoy\u2019s security policy. Versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9 contain a patch. As a workaround, disable adding request headers based on the downstream request properties, such as downstream certificate properties.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27493", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.23.0andbefore (<) 1.23.6cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.25.0andbefore (<) 1.25.3cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.24.0andbefore (<) 1.24.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.22.9cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-14  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-06  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-10  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-03-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-06  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-04-12  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-w5w5-487h-qv8q", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
