{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30541", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. A function in the implementation contract may be inaccessible if its selector clashes with one of the proxy's own selectors. Specifically, if the clashing function has a different signature with incompatible ABI encoding, the proxy could revert while attempting to decode the arguments from calldata. The probability of an accidental clash is negligible, but one could be caused deliberately and could cause a reduction in availability. The issue has been fixed in version 4.8.3. As a workaround if a function appears to be inaccessible for this reason, it may be possible to craft the calldata such that ABI decoding does not fail at the proxy and the function is properly proxied through.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30541", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 4.8.3cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts Upgradeable\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 4.8.3cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts_upgradeable:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-27  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-19  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-23  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-17  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-04-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-mx2q-35m2-x2rh", "ref_desc": "TransparentUpgradeableProxy clashing selector calls may not be delegated \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.8.3", "ref_desc": "Release v4.8.3 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HbjGnGmcD0NUu9Xz40BlWs-PdvY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4154", "ref_desc": "Fix TransparentUpgradeableProxy's transparency by Amxx \u00b7 Pull Request #4154 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
