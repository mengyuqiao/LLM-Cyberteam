{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29019", "Description": "@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. Applications using `@fastify/passport` in affected versions for user authentication, in combination with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism, are vulnerable to session fixation attacks from network and same-site attackers. fastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport` library for user authentication. The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function, the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers can hijack the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId` upon login, preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from being upgraded to an authenticated session. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29019", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFastify\u00bbPassport\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:fastify:passport:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nFastify\u00bbPassport\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:fastify:passport:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-01  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-23  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-27  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-03-21  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 6  2023-05-05  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/commit/43c82c321db58ea3e375dd475de60befbfcf2a11", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-4m3m-ppvx-xgw9 \u00b7 fastify/fastify-passport@43c82c3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation", "ref_desc": "Session fixation | OWASP FoundationTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/security/advisories/GHSA-4m3m-ppvx-xgw9", "ref_desc": "Session fixation in fastify-passport \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fastify/fastify-passport \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
