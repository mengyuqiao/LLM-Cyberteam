{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28851", "Description": "Silverstripe Form Capture provides a method to capture simple silverstripe forms and an admin interface for users. Starting in version 0.2.0 and prior to versions 1.0.2, 1.1.0, 2.2.5, and 3.1.1, improper escaping when presenting stored form submissions allowed for an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack. The vulnerability was initially patched in version 1.0.2, and version 1.1.0 includes this patch. The bug was then accidentally re-introduced during a merge error, and has been re-patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.1.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28851", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nBigfork\u00bbSilverstripe Form CaptureVersions  from including (>=) 0.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.2.3cpe:2.3:a:bigfork:silverstripe_form_capture:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigfork\u00bbSilverstripe Form CaptureVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.5cpe:2.3:a:bigfork:silverstripe_form_capture:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigfork\u00bbSilverstripe Form Capture\u00bbVersion:3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:bigfork:silverstripe_form_capture:3.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigfork\u00bbSilverstripe Form Capture\u00bbVersion:1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:bigfork:silverstripe_form_capture:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigfork\u00bbSilverstripe Form Capture\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:bigfork:silverstripe_form_capture:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigfork\u00bbSilverstripe Form Capture\u00bbVersion:3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:bigfork:silverstripe_form_capture:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/commit/5b3aa39dd1eef042f173167b0fa4d3f717971772", "ref_desc": "Fix improper escaping of details fields in GridField view \u00b7 bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture@5b3aa39 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/security/advisories/GHSA-38h6-gmr2-j4wx", "ref_desc": "Improper Handling of User Input - Cross-Site Scripting (Stored) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
