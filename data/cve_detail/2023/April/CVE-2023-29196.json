{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29196", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. This vulnerability is not exploitable on the default install of Discourse. A custom feature must be enabled for it to work at all, and the attacker\u2019s payload must pass the CSP to be executed. However, if an attacker succeeds in embedding Javascript that does pass the CSP, it could result in session hijacking for any users that view the attacker\u2019s post. The vulnerability is patched in the latest tests-passed, beta and stable branches. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should enable and/or restore your site's CSP to the default one provided with Discourse. Remove any embed-able hosts configured.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29196", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     StableEditionVersions  before (<) 3.0.3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:stable:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     BetaEditionVersions  before (<) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.1.0UpdateBeta1   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.1.0:beta1:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.1.0UpdateBeta2   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.1.0:beta2:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.1.0UpdateBeta3   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.1.0:beta3:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-20  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 4  2024-04-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-04-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-986p-4x8q-8f48", "ref_desc": "HTML injection via topic embedding \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
