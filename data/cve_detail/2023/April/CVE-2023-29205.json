{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29205", "Description": "XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The HTML macro does not systematically perform a proper neutralization of script-related html tags. As a result, any user able to use the html macro in XWiki, is able to introduce an XSS attack. This can be particularly dangerous since in a standard wiki, any user is able to use the html macro directly in their own user profile page. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.8RC1. The patch involves the HTML macros and are systematically cleaned up whenever the user does not have the script correct.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29205", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 14.7cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-03-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-04-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-vxf7-mx22-jr24", "ref_desc": "Multiple instances of stored cross-site scripting (XSS) via HTML and raw macro \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18568", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-18568] Multiple instances of stored cross-site scripting (XSS) via editor and HTML macro - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
