{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30535", "Description": "Snowflake JDBC provides a JDBC type 4 driver that supports core functionality, allowing Java program to connect to Snowflake. Users of the Snowflake JDBC driver were vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability. An attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. The vulnerability was patched on March 17, 2023 as part of Snowflake JDBC driver Version 3.13.29. All users should immediately upgrade the Snowflake JDBC driver to the latest version: 3.13.29.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30535", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSnowflake\u00bbSnowflake JdbcVersions  before (<) 3.13.29cpe:2.3:a:snowflake:snowflake_jdbc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.75% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-04  0.63%  0.75%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-09-24  0.56%  0.63%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-05-16  0.42%  0.56%  +0.15 \n 4  2024-04-20  0.30%  0.42%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-03-14  0.21%  0.30%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.28%  0.21%  -0.07 \n 7  2023-05-24  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-05-16  0.29%  0.23%  -0.06 \n 9  2023-05-08  0.22%  0.29%  +0.08 \n 10  2023-04-25  0.05%  0.22%  +0.16 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-4g3j-c4wg-6j7x", "ref_desc": "2023-3-17 Snowflake JDBC Security Advisory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/JDBC-Driver-Release-Notes", "ref_desc": "JDBC Driver Release NotesRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
