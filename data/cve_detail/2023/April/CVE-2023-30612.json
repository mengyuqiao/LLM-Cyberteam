{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30612", "Description": "Cloud hypervisor is a Virtual Machine Monitor for Cloud workloads. This vulnerability allows users to close arbitrary open file descriptors in the Cloud Hypervisor process via sending malicious HTTP request through the HTTP API socket. As a result, the Cloud Hypervisor process can be easily crashed, causing Deny-of-Service (DoS). This can also be a potential Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability. Users require to have the write access to the API socket file to trigger this vulnerability.  Impacted versions of Cloud Hypervisor include upstream main branch, v31.0, and v30.0. The vulnerability was initially detected by our `http_api_fuzzer` via oss-fuzz. This issue has been addressed in versions 30.1 and 31.1. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring the write access to the API socket file is granted to trusted users only.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30612", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCloudhypervisor\u00bbCloud Hypervisor\u00bbVersion:31.1ForRustcpe:2.3:a:cloudhypervisor:cloud_hypervisor:31.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nCloudhypervisor\u00bbCloud Hypervisor\u00bbVersion:30.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:cloudhypervisor:cloud_hypervisor:30.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-09  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-24  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.09%  0.16%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-03-19  0.07%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-02  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/pull/5373", "ref_desc": "Extend 'VmConfig' with 'preserved_fds' by likebreath \u00b7 Pull Request #5373 \u00b7 cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/security/advisories/GHSA-g6mw-f26h-4jgp", "ref_desc": "Malicious HTTP requests could close arbitrary opening file descriptors \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/pull/5350", "ref_desc": "vmm: Ignore and warn TAP FDs sent via the HTTP request body by likebreath \u00b7 Pull Request #5350 \u00b7 cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://oss-fuzz.com/testcase-detail/5426283514560512", "ref_desc": "Log inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://oss-fuzz.com/testcase-detail/5260873569796096", "ref_desc": "Log inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
