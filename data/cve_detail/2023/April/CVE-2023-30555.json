{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30555", "Description": "Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases.Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `explain` method in `sql_optimize.py`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value in the `explain` endpoint is passed to the following `query` methods of each database engine for execution. `query` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`, and `query` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-108`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30555", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nArcherydms\u00bbArchery\u00bbVersion:1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:archerydms:archery:1.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-24  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-349r-2663-cr3w", "ref_desc": "SQL injection in sql_optimize.py explain method GHSL-2022-108 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hhyo/Archery \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
