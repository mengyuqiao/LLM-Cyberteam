{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30547", "Description": "vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules. There exists a vulnerability in exception sanitization of vm2 for versions up to 3.9.16, allowing attackers to raise an unsanitized host exception inside `handleException()` which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.17` of `vm2`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30547", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVm2 Project\u00bbVM2\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.9.16cpe:2.3:a:vm2_project:vm2:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-22  0.24%  0.29%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-11-07  0.21%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-27  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-08-11  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-19  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-04-23  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-03-17  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-02-11  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 9  2024-02-09  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-12-15  0.13%  0.10%  -0.03 \n 11  2023-12-11  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 12  2023-10-08  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-08-20  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 14  2023-07-25  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 15  2023-07-08  0.12%  0.08%  -0.03 \n 16  2023-05-08  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 17  2023-04-28  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/f3db4dee4d76b19869df05ba7880d638a880edd5", "ref_desc": "Handle host errors captured in Promises \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2@f3db4de \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-ch3r-j5x3-6q2m", "ref_desc": "Sandbox Escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/4b22e87b102d97d45d112a0931dba1aef7eea049", "ref_desc": "Ensure every catch block is protected \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2@4b22e87 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/leesh3288/381b230b04936dd4d74aaf90cc8bb244", "ref_desc": "Sandbox Escape in vm2@3.9.16 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
