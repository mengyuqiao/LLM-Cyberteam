{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30618", "Description": "Kitchen-Terraform provides a set of Test Kitchen plugins which enable the use of Test Kitchen to converge a Terraform configuration and verify the resulting infrastructure systems with InSpec controls. Kitchen-Terraform v7.0.0 introduced a regression which caused all Terraform output values, including sensitive values, to be printed at the `info` logging level during the `kitchen converge` action. Prior to v7.0.0, the output values were printed at the `debug` level to avoid writing sensitive values to the terminal by default. An attacker would need access to the local machine in order to gain access to these logs during an operation. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30618", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKitchen-terraform Project\u00bbKitchen-terraform\u00bbVersion:7.0.0ForRubycpe:2.3:a:kitchen-terraform_project:kitchen-terraform:7.0.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/newcontext-oss/kitchen-terraform/commit/3d20d60e7a891e2dd747df995a31226fa0b4ac48", "ref_desc": "Fix Converge Debug Logging and Prepare 7.0.1 (#522) \u00b7 newcontext-oss/kitchen-terraform@3d20d60 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/newcontext-oss/kitchen-terraform/security/advisories/GHSA-65g2-x53q-cmf6", "ref_desc": "Sensitive Terraform Output Values Printed At Info Logging Level In Kitchen-Terraform v7.0.0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 newcontext-oss/kitchen-terraform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
