{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27524", "Description": "Session Validation attacks in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.0.1. Installations that have not altered the default configured SECRET_KEY according to installation instructions allow for an attacker to authenticate and access unauthorized resources. This does not affect Superset administrators who have changed the default value for SECRET_KEY config.\n\nAll superset installations should always set a unique secure random SECRET_KEY. Your SECRET_KEY is used to securely sign all session cookies and encrypting sensitive information on the database.\nAdd a strong SECRET_KEY to your `superset_config.py` file like:\n\nSECRET_KEY = <YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY>\n\nAlternatively you can set it with `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27524", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSupersetVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:superset:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  97.03%  97.04%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-14  97.05%  97.03%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-11-01  96.97%  97.05%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-10-04  97.06%  96.97%  -0.09 \n 5  2024-07-29  97.03%  97.06%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-07-16  97.06%  97.03%  -0.03 \n 7  2024-07-03  97.04%  97.06%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-06-20  97.06%  97.04%  -0.02 \n 9  2024-06-11  97.16%  97.06%  -0.10 \n 10  2024-06-07  97.12%  97.16%  +0.03 \n 11  2024-05-26  97.10%  97.12%  +0.03 \n 12  2024-05-13  97.04%  97.10%  +0.05 \n 13  2024-04-30  97.08%  97.04%  -0.04 \n 14  2024-04-21  97.29%  97.08%  -0.21 \n 15  2024-04-19  97.30%  97.29%  -0.01 \n 16  2024-04-05  97.23%  97.30%  +0.07 \n 17  2024-03-24  97.22%  97.23%  +0.00 \n 18  2024-03-13  97.25%  97.22%  -0.02 \n 19  2024-02-29  97.23%  97.25%  +0.01 \n 20  2024-02-18  97.22%  97.23%  +0.01 \n 21  2024-02-07  96.12%  97.22%  +1.11 \n 22  2024-02-06  96.18%  96.12%  -0.07 \n 23  2024-01-26  96.27%  96.18%  -0.09 \n 24  2024-01-21  96.23%  96.27%  +0.04 \n 25  2024-01-09  90.65%  96.23%  +5.58 \n 26  2024-01-04  90.70%  90.65%  -0.05 \n 27  2023-12-01  89.59%  90.70%  +1.11 \n 28  2023-11-07  91.29%  89.59%  -1.70 \n 29  2023-10-15  93.29%  91.29%  -1.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1188/Initialization-of-a-Resource-with-an-Insecure-Default.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175094/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Superset 2.0.0 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1svmD3_HCW5NerBU5PQsOHD_rEk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/n0ftx60sllf527j7g11kmt24wvof8xyk", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-27524: Apache Superset: Session validation vulnerability when using provided default SECRET_KEY-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175094/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Superset 2.0.0 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/24/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-27524: Apache Superset: Session validation vulnerability when using provided default SECRET_KEYMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172522/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Authentication-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Superset 2.0.0 Authentication Bypass \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172522/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Authentication-Bypass.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Superset 2.0.0 Authentication Bypass \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/24/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-27524: Apache Superset: Session validation vulnerability when using provided default SECRET_KEYMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
