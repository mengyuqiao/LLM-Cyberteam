{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30606", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions a user logged as an administrator can call arbitrary methods on the `SiteSetting` class, notably `#clear_cache!` and `#notify_changed!`, which when done on a multisite instance, can affect the entire cluster resulting in a denial of service. Users not running in multisite environments are not affected. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30606", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     StableEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:stable:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     BetaEditionVersions  before (<) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.1.0UpdateBeta1   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.1.0:beta1:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.1.0UpdateBeta2   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.1.0:beta2:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-20  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-04-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-04-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-jj93-w3mv-3jvv", "ref_desc": "Multisite DoS through unsanitized dynamic dispatch to SiteSetting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
