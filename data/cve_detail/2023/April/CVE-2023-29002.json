{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29002", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. When run in debug mode, Cilium will log the contents of the `cilium-secrets` namespace. This could include data such as TLS private keys for Ingress and GatewayAPI resources. An attacker with access to debug output from the Cilium containers could use the resulting output to intercept and modify traffic to and from the affected cluster. Output of the sensitive information would occur at Cilium agent restart, when secrets in the namespace are modified, and on creation of Ingress or GatewayAPI resources. This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium releases 1.11.16, 1.12.9, and 1.13.2. Users unable to upgrade should disable debug mode.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29002", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.0andbefore (<) 1.11.16cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.9cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.2cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-pg5p-wwp8-97g8", "ref_desc": "Debug mode leaks confidential data in Cilium \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
