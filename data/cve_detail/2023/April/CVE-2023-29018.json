{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29018", "Description": "The OpenFeature Operator allows users to expose feature flags to applications. Assuming the pre-existence of a vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution, an attacker could leverage the lax permissions configured on `open-feature-operator-controller-manager` to escalate the privileges of any SA in the cluster. The increased privileges could be used to modify cluster state, leading to DoS, or read sensitive data, including secrets. Version 0.2.32 mitigates this issue by restricting the resources the `open-feature-operator-controller-manager` can modify.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29018", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbOpenfeature\u00bbForKubernetesVersions  before (<) 0.2.32cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:openfeature:*:*:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-04  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-24  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-20  0.08%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-03-14  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-04-26  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator/releases/tag/v0.2.32", "ref_desc": "Release v0.2.32 \u00b7 open-feature/open-feature-operator \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-cwf6-xj49-wp83", "ref_desc": "Cluster-level Privilege Escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-feature/open-feature-operator \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
