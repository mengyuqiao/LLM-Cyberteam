{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30556", "Description": "Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `optimize_sqltuningadvisor` method of `sql_optimize.py`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value in `sql_optimize.py` is passed to the `sqltuningadvisor` method in `oracle.py`for execution. To mitigate escape the variables accepted via user input when used in `sql_optimize.py`. Users may also use prepared statements when dealing with SQL as a mitigation for this issue. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-107`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30556", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nArcherydms\u00bbArchery\u00bbVersion:1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:archerydms:archery:1.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-24  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-6pv9-9gq7-hr68", "ref_desc": "SQL injection in sql_optimize.py optimize_sqltuningadvisor method GHSL-2022-107 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hhyo/Archery \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
