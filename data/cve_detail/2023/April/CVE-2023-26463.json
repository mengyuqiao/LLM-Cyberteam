{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26463", "Description": "strongSwan 5.9.8 and 5.9.9 potentially allows remote code execution because it uses a variable named \"public\" for two different purposes within the same function. There is initially incorrect access control, later followed by an expired pointer dereference. One attack vector is sending an untrusted client certificate during EAP-TLS. A server is affected only if it loads plugins that implement TLS-based EAP methods (EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-PEAP, or EAP-TNC). This is fixed in 5.9.10.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26463", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nStrongswan\u00bbStrongswan\u00bbVersion:5.9.9cpe:2.3:a:strongswan:strongswan:5.9.9:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nStrongswan\u00bbStrongswan\u00bbVersion:5.9.8cpe:2.3:a:strongswan:strongswan:5.9.8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.86% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.73%  0.86%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-11-04  0.69%  0.73%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-24  0.78%  0.69%  -0.10 \n 4  2024-05-16  0.76%  0.78%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-20  0.23%  0.76%  +0.53 \n 6  2024-03-14  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.28%  0.24%  -0.05 \n 8  2023-05-18  0.14%  0.28%  +0.14 \n 9  2023-04-26  0.04%  0.14%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2023/03/02/strongswan-vulnerability-%28cve-2023-26463%29.html", "ref_desc": "strongSwan - strongSwan Vulnerability (CVE-2023-26463)Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230517-0010/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-26463 strongSwan Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 strongswan/strongswan \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Kw9bWgI8BhNZol3kY7YgIMC4HsU.html"}]}
