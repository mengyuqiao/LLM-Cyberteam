{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30841", "Description": "Baremetal Operator (BMO) is a bare metal host provisioning integration for Kubernetes. Prior to version 0.3.0, ironic and ironic-inspector deployed within Baremetal Operator using the included `deploy.sh` store their `.htpasswd` files as ConfigMaps instead of Secrets. This causes the plain-text username and hashed password to be readable by anyone having a cluster-wide read-access to the management cluster, or access to the management cluster's Etcd storage. This issue is patched in baremetal-operator PR#1241, and is included in BMO release 0.3.0 onwards. As a workaround, users may modify the kustomizations and redeploy the BMO, or recreate the required ConfigMaps as Secrets per instructions in baremetal-operator PR#1241.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30841", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbBaremetal OperatorVersions  before (<) 0.3.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:baremetal_operator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-9wh7-397j-722m", "ref_desc": "Ironic and ironic-inspector may expose htpasswd files as ConfigMaps \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 metal3-io/baremetal-operator \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/pull/1241", "ref_desc": "\u26a0\ufe0f Store htpasswd files in Secrets instead of ConfigMaps by lentzi90 \u00b7 Pull Request #1241 \u00b7 metal3-io/baremetal-operator \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
