{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29529", "Description": "matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. An attacker present in a room where an MSC3401 group call is taking place can eavesdrop on the video and audio of participants using matrix-js-sdk, without their knowledge. To affected matrix-js-sdk users, the attacker will not appear to be participating in the call. This attack is possible because matrix-js-sdk's group call implementation accepts incoming direct calls from other users, even if they have not yet declared intent to participate in the group call, as a means of resolving a race condition in call setup. Affected versions do not restrict access to the user's outbound media in this case. Legacy 1:1 calls are unaffected. This is fixed in matrix-js-sdk 24.1.0. As a workaround, users may hold group calls in private rooms where only the exact users who are expected to participate in the call are present.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29529", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbJavascript Sdk\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 24.1.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:javascript_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-04  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-24  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-16  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-20  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-14  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-04-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401", "ref_desc": "MSC3401: Native Group VoIP Signalling by ara4n \u00b7 Pull Request #3401 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases/tag/v24.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release v24.1.0 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6g67-q39g-r79q", "ref_desc": "Invisible eavesdropping in group calls \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
