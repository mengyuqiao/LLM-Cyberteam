{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30847", "Description": "H2O is an HTTP server. In versions 2.3.0-beta2 and prior, when the reverse proxy handler tries to processes a certain type of invalid HTTP request, it tries to build an upstream URL by reading from uninitialized pointer. This behavior can lead to crashes or leak of information to back end HTTP servers. Pull request  number 3229 fixes the issue. The pull request has been merged to the `master` branch in commit f010336. Users should upgrade to commit f010336 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30847", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDena\u00bbH2OVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.6cpe:2.3:a:dena:h2o:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDena\u00bbH2O\u00bbVersion:2.3.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:dena:h2o:2.3.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDena\u00bbH2O\u00bbVersion:2.3.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:dena:h2o:2.3.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.23%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-17  0.23%  0.23%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-10-07  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-29  0.18%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-05-03  0.11%  0.18%  +0.08 \n 6  2024-03-27  0.07%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-05-10  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/824/Access-of-Uninitialized-Pointer.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/h2o/h2o/security/advisories/GHSA-p5hj-phwj-hrvx", "ref_desc": "invalid memory read in proxy handler \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 h2o/h2o \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/f010336bab162839df43d9e87570897466c97e33", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #3229 from h2o/kazuho/reverse-proxy-invalid-read \u00b7 h2o/h2o@f010336 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/3229", "ref_desc": "[reverse proxy] invalid memory read by kazuho \u00b7 Pull Request #3229 \u00b7 h2o/h2o \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
