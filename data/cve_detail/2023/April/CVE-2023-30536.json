{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30536", "Description": "slim/psr7 is a PSR-7 implementation for use with Slim 4. In versions prior to 1.6.1 an attacker could sneak in a newline (\\n) into both the header names and values. While the specification states that \\r\\n\\r\\n is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept \\n\\n. An attacker that is able to control the header names that are passed to Slilm-Psr7 would be able to intentionally craft invalid messages, possibly causing application errors or invalid HTTP requests being sent out with an PSR-18 HTTP client. The latter might present a denial of service vector if a remote service\u2019s web application firewall bans the application due to the receipt of malformed requests. The issue has been patched in version 1.6.1. There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30536", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSlimframework\u00bbSlim Psr-7Versions  before (<) 1.6.1cpe:2.3:a:slimframework:slim_psr-7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-27  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-19  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-05-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Psr7/security/advisories/GHSA-q2qj-628g-vhfw", "ref_desc": "Improper header validation in slim/psr7 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 slimphp/Slim-Psr7 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Psr7/commit/ed1d553225dd190875d8814c47460daed4b550bb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-q2qj-628g-vhfw \u00b7 slimphp/Slim-Psr7@ed1d553 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.2.4", "ref_desc": "RFC 7230: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and RoutingTechnical DescriptionCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UK9832grwWiMIvwre0AJXIk4oCo.html"}]}
