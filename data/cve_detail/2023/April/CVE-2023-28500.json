{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28500", "Description": "A Java insecure deserialization vulnerability in Adobe LiveCycle ES4 version 11.0 and earlier allows unauthenticated remote attackers to gain operating system code execution by submitting specially crafted Java serialized objects to a specific URL. Adobe LiveCycle ES4 version 11.0.1 and later may be vulnerable if the application is installed with Java environment 7u21 and earlier. Exploitation of the vulnerability depends on two factors: insecure deserialization methods used in the Adobe LiveCycle application, and the use of Java environments 7u21 and earlier. The code execution is performed in the context of the account that is running the Adobe LiveCycle application. If the account is privileged, exploitation provides privileged access to the operating system. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28500", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAdobe\u00bbLivecycle Es4Versions  before (<) 11.0.1cpe:2.3:a:adobe:livecycle_es4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.30%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-27  0.25%  0.30%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-05-08  0.32%  0.25%  -0.08 \n 4  2024-04-12  0.23%  0.32%  +0.10 \n 5  2024-03-06  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-02-08  0.11%  0.24%  +0.13 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-05-08  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-04-15  0.04%  0.11%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://coastalsecurity.gitbook.io/critical-vulnerability-adobe-livecycle-es4v11.0/", "ref_desc": "Critical RCE Vulnerability in Adobe LiveCycle ES4v11.0 - RCE in Adobe LiveCycle ES4v11.0", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
