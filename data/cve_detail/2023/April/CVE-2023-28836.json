{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28836", "Description": "Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Starting in version 1.5 and prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on ModelAdmin views within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft pages and documents that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, and only affects sites with ModelAdmin enabled. For page, the vulnerability is in the \"Choose a parent page\" ModelAdmin view (`ChooseParentView`), available when managing pages via ModelAdmin. For documents, the vulnerability is in the ModelAdmin Inspect view (`InspectView`) when displaying document fields. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can disable or override the corresponding functionality.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28836", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 4.2andbefore (<) 4.2.2cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 1.5andbefore (<) 4.1.4cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-24  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-07-08  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-03  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-11  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/eefc3381d37b476791610e5d30594fae443f33af", "ref_desc": "Release note for CVE-2023-28836 in 4.1.4 \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@eefc338 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/releases/tag/v4.2.2", "ref_desc": "Release 4.2.2 \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5C21c0vTromniIQx1-9IHCBqCTY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/ff806ab173a504395fdfb3139eb0a29444ab4b91", "ref_desc": "Change ModelAdmin InspectView to escape any HTML from document titles \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@ff806ab \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/bc84bf9815610cfbf8db3b6050c7ddcbaa4b9713", "ref_desc": "Release note for CVE-2023-28836 in 4.2.2 \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@bc84bf9 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#customising-chooseparentview", "ref_desc": "Customising ChooseParentView \u2014 Wagtail Documentation 4.2.2 documentationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#enabling-customising-inspectview", "ref_desc": "Enabling & customising InspectView \u2014 Wagtail Documentation 4.2.2 documentationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/5be2b1ed55fd7259dfdf2c82e7701dba407b8b62", "ref_desc": "Change ChooseParentView to use plain text breadcrumbs for page titles\u2026 \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@5be2b1e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-5286-f2rf-35c2", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS attack via ModelAdmin views \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
