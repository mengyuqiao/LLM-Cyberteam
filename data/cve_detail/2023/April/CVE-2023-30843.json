{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30843", "Description": "Payload is a free and open source headless content management system. In versions prior to 1.7.0, if a user has access to documents that contain hidden fields or fields they do not have access to, the user could reverse-engineer those values via brute force. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, write a `beforeOperation` hook to remove `where` queries that attempt to access hidden field data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30843", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nPayloadcms\u00bbPayload\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:payloadcms:payload:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-26  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/security/advisories/GHSA-35jj-vqcf-f2jf", "ref_desc": "Hidden fields can be leaked on readable collections \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 payloadcms/payload \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/releases/tag/v1.7.0", "ref_desc": "Release Release 1.7.0 \u00b7 payloadcms/payload \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
