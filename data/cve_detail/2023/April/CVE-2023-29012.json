{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29012", "Description": "Git for Windows is the Windows port of Git. Prior to version 2.40.1, any user of Git CMD who starts the command in an untrusted directory is impacted by an Uncontrolles Search Path Element vulnerability. Maliciously-placed `doskey.exe` would be executed silently upon running Git CMD. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, avoid using Git CMD or, if using Git CMD, avoid starting it in an untrusted directory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29012", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGit For Windows Project\u00bbGit For WindowsVersions  before (<) 2.40.1cpe:2.3:a:git_for_windows_project:git_for_windows:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-27  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1", "ref_desc": "Release Git for Windows 2.40.1 \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-F6mmLdTld1Ck-sXU6czD_wKEyw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5x-v87v-8f7g", "ref_desc": "Git CMD erroneously executes `doskey.exe` in the current directory, if it exists \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
