{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29510", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In XWiki, every user can add translations that are only applied to the current user. This also allows overriding existing translations. Such translations are often included in privileged contexts without any escaping which allows remote code execution for any user who has edit access on at least one document which could be the user's own profile where edit access is enabled by default. A mitigation for this vulnerability is part of XWiki 14.10.2 and XWiki 15.0 RC1: translations with user scope now require script right. This means that regular users cannot exploit this anymore as users don't have script right by default anymore starting with XWiki 14.10. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a patched versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29510", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  before (<) 14.10.2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-23  0.39%  0.49%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-11-08  0.38%  0.39%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-24  0.31%  0.38%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-03-18  0.26%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-02-23  0.26%  0.26%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-29  0.06%  0.26%  +0.20 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d06ff8a58480abc7f63eb1d4b8b366024d990643", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19749: Require script right for translations with user scope \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@d06ff8a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19749", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-19749] Privilege escalation (PR) with edit rights through unescaped translations - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-4v38-964c-xjmw", "ref_desc": "RCE via unescaped translations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
