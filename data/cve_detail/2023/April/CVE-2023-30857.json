{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30857", "Description": "@aedart/support is the support package for Ion, a monorepo for JavaScript/TypeScript packages. Prior to version `0.6.1`, there is a possible prototype pollution issue for the `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class' metadata object, in `meta` decorator from the `@aedart/support` package. The likelihood of exploitation is questionable, given that a class's metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can lead to a security impact. The issue has been patched in version `0.6.1`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30857", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAedart\u00bbION\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.6.1cpe:2.3:a:aedart:ion:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-08  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-30  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-04  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-28  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aedart/ion/commit/c3e2ee08710d4164d796ecb66ed291335dae9291", "ref_desc": "Fix possible prototype pollution \u00b7 aedart/ion@c3e2ee0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aedart/ion/security/advisories/GHSA-wwxh-74fx-33c6", "ref_desc": "Possible prototype pollution in metadata record, when using meta decorator \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aedart/ion \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
