{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30538", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Due to the improper sanitization of SVG files, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on the users\u2019 browsers by uploading a crafted SVG file. This issue is patched in the latest stable and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade there are two possible workarounds: enable CDN handing of uploads (and ensure the CDN sanitizes SVG files) or disable SVG file uploads by ensuring that the `authorized extensions` site setting does not include `svg` (or reset that setting to the default, by default Discourse doesn't enable SVG uploads by users).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30538", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     StableEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.0.2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:stable:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     BetaEditionVersions  before (<) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.1.0UpdateBeta1   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.1.0:beta1:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.1.0UpdateBeta2   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.1.0:beta2:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.1.0UpdateBeta3   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.1.0:beta3:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-04-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-w5mv-4pjf-xj43", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via improper sanitization of SVG uploads \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
