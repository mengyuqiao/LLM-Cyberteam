{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30609", "Description": "matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection payload. No cross-site scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content security policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30609", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix-react-sdk Project\u00bbMatrix-react-sdk\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.71.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix-react-sdk_project:matrix-react-sdk:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-27  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-25  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-xv83-x443-7rmw", "ref_desc": "HTML injection in search results via plaintext message highlighting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/releases/tag/v3.71.0", "ref_desc": "Release v3.71.0 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/commit/bf182bc94556849d7acdfa0e5fdea2aa129ea826", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xv83-x443-7rmw \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk@bf182bc \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
