{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31290", "Description": "Trust Wallet Core before 3.1.1, as used in the Trust Wallet browser extension before 0.0.183, allows theft of funds because the entropy is 32 bits, as exploited in the wild in December 2022 and March 2023. This occurs because the mt19937 Mersenne Twister takes a single 32-bit value as an input seed, resulting in only four billion possible mnemonics. The affected versions of the browser extension are 0.0.172 through 0.0.182. To steal funds efficiently, an attacker can identify all Ethereum addresses created since the 0.0.172 release, and check whether they are Ethereum addresses that could have been created by this extension. To respond to the risk, affected users need to upgrade the product version and also move funds to a new wallet address.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31290", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTrustwallet\u00bbTrust Wallet Browser ExtensionVersions  from including (>=) 0.0.172andbefore (<) 0.0.183cpe:2.3:a:trustwallet:trust_wallet_browser_extension:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTrustwallet\u00bbTrust Wallet CoreVersions  before (<) 3.1.1cpe:2.3:a:trustwallet:trust_wallet_core:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-01  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-29  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-05-03  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 6  2024-03-27  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://community.trustwallet.com/t/wasm-vulnerability-incident-update-and-recommended-actions/750786", "ref_desc": "WASM Vulnerability, Incident Update, and Recommended Actions - Announcements - Trust WalletVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://community.trustwallet.com/t/browser-extension-wasm-vulnerability-postmortem/750787", "ref_desc": "Browser Extension WASM Vulnerability Postmortem - Announcements - Trust WalletVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.ledger.com/Funds-of-every-wallet-created-with-the-Trust-Wallet-browser-extension-could-have-been-stolen/", "ref_desc": "Funds of every wallet created with the Trust Wallet browser extension could have been stolen without any user interactionExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/TrustWallet/status/1649699428733947906", "ref_desc": "Tweet / TwitterThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core/compare/3.1.0...3.1.1", "ref_desc": "Comparing 3.1.0...3.1.1 \u00b7 trustwallet/wallet-core \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
