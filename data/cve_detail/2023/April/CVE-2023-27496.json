{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27496", "Description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, the OAuth filter assumes that a `state` query param is present on any response that looks like an OAuth redirect response. Sending it a request with the URI path equivalent to the redirect path, without the `state` parameter, will lead to abnormal termination of Envoy process. Versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9 contain a patch. The issue can also be mitigated by locking down OAuth traffic, disabling the filter, or by filtering traffic before it reaches the OAuth filter (e.g. via a lua script).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27496", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.23.0andbefore (<) 1.23.6cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.25.0andbefore (<) 1.25.3cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  from including (>=) 1.24.0andbefore (<) 1.24.4cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnvoyproxy\u00bbEnvoyVersions  before (<) 1.22.9cpe:2.3:a:envoyproxy:envoy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-14  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-10  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-12  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-j79q-2g66-2xv5", "ref_desc": "Crash when a redirect url without a state param is received in the oauth filter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 envoyproxy/envoy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
