{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25815", "Description": "In Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, no localized messages are shipped with the installer. As a consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function's implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.\n\nThis vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may remove the permission to create folders in `C:\\`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25815", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGit For Windows Project\u00bbGit For WindowsVersions  before (<) 2.40.1cpe:2.3:a:git_for_windows_project:git_for_windows:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-134 Use of Externally-Controlled Format String", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/134/Use-of-Externally-Controlled-Format-String.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461", "ref_desc": "gettext: update to 0.21 by lazka \u00b7 Pull Request #10461 \u00b7 msys2/MINGW-packages \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1", "ref_desc": "Release Git for Windows 2.40.1 \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-F6mmLdTld1Ck-sXU6czD_wKEyw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html", "ref_desc": "fprintfProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: git-2.40.1-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0Jt_Xpyv38Jb4FUtHOU73szZe4s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 36 Update: git-2.40.1-1.fc36 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bvuPWVksUVGAypgyIQCvrgrrhlc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8", "ref_desc": "Git looks for localized messages in an unprivileged place \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3844-1] git security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DXEtswxOXADGTXcx8ga_0tvzW8c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15", "ref_desc": "Git: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202312-15) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FmrWTBDJHb93fVTh7fn9e5UAadE.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [ANNOUNCE] Git v2.40.1 and friendsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Lri7h4SZZwvSyD4qAqLEikVSzxE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: git-2.40.1-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RUhCZOAAJ-EcTUgRW3uJptL1XbE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/#writing-to-the-stack", "ref_desc": "Exploit 101 - Format Strings - BreakInSecurityProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
