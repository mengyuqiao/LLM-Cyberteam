{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26060", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Nokia NetAct before 22 FP2211. On the Working Set Manager page, users can create a Working Set with a name that has a client-side template injection payload. Input validation is missing during creation of the working set. For an external attacker, it is very difficult to exploit this, because a few dynamically created parameters such as Jsession-id, a CSRF token, and an Nxsrf token would be needed. The attack can realistically only be performed by an internal user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26060", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNokia\u00bbNetactVersions  before (<) 20.1cpe:2.3:a:nokia:netact:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-04  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-30  0.07%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-03-24  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nokia.com", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DxxRtwl26YEsX0v3ejT4weYX9PQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/threatscape/pt-2022-04/", "ref_desc": "PT-2022-04: Cross Site Template Injection (CSTI)Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
