{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22894", "Description": "Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22894", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nStrapi\u00bbStrapiVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.1andbefore (<) 4.8.0cpe:2.3:a:strapi:strapi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.15%  0.15%  0.00 \n 2  2024-09-29  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.09%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-03-19  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases", "ref_desc": "Releases \u00b7 strapi/strapi \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/66l1fh7v7owy4r08cxqYh7eAFEc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://strapi.io/blog/security-disclosure-of-vulnerabilities-cve", "ref_desc": "Security Disclosure of VulnerabilitiesExploit;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/aZ2dsRz8EKmAFdyPP5zRU2sKMJs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.ghostccamm.com/blog/multi_strapi_vulns/", "ref_desc": "Multiple Critical Vulnerabilities in Strapi Versions <=4.7.1Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/l6xRhocN739uH2S6yqd9lxixTas.html"}]}
