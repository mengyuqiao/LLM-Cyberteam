{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24822", "Description": "RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a NULL pointer dereference while encoding a 6LoWPAN IPHC header. The NULL pointer dereference causes a hard fault exception, leading to denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, apply the patches manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24822", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRiot-os\u00bbRiotVersions  before (<) 2022.10cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-14  0.11%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-10-04  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-26  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-30  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-05-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/7253e261556f252816f4a3b7c4f96fc10d642485", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes [backport 2022.10] by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18820 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/639c04325de4ceb9d444955f4927bfae95843a39", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18817 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-8x69-5fhj-72wh", "ref_desc": "Null Pointer dereference during IPHC encoding \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
