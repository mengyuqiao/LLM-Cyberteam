{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29383", "Description": "In Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into fields provided to the SUID program chfn (change finger). Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that \"cat /etc/passwd\" shows a rogue user account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29383", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nShadow Project\u00bbShadow\u00bbVersion:4.13cpe:2.3:a:shadow_project:shadow:4.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687", "ref_desc": "Control character check by tomspiderlabs \u00b7 Pull Request #687 \u00b7 shadow-maint/shadow \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-29383: Abusing Linux chfn to Misrepresent etc passwd | TrustwaveExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d", "ref_desc": "Added control character check \u00b7 shadow-maint/shadow@e5905c4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
