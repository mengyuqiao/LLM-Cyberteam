{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30622", "Description": "Clusternet is a general-purpose system for controlling Kubernetes clusters across different environments. An issue in clusternet prior to version 0.15.2 can be leveraged to lead to a cluster-level privilege escalation. The clusternet has a deployment called `cluster-hub` inside the `clusternet-system` Kubernetes namespace, which runs on worker nodes randomly. The deployment has a service account called `clusternet-hub`, which has a cluster role called `clusternet:hub` via cluster role binding. The `clusternet:hub` cluster role has `\"*\" verbs of \"*.*\"` resources. Thus, if a malicious user can access the worker node which runs the clusternet, they can leverage the service account to do malicious actions to critical system resources. For example, the malicious user can leverage the service account to get ALL secrets in the entire cluster, resulting in cluster-level privilege escalation. Version 0.15.2 contains a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30622", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nClusternet\u00bbClusternetVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.15.1cpe:2.3:a:clusternet:clusternet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet/security/advisories/GHSA-833c-xh79-p429", "ref_desc": "A potential risk in clusternet which can be leveraged to make a cluster-level privilege escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 clusternet/clusternet \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet/releases/tag/v0.15.2", "ref_desc": "Release v0.15.2 \u00b7 clusternet/clusternet \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
