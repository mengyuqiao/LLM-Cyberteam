{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25601", "Description": "On version 3.0.0 through 3.1.1, Apache DolphinScheduler's python gateway suffered from improper authentication: an attacker could use a socket bytes attack without authentication. This issue has been fixed from version 3.1.2 onwards. For users who use version 3.0.0 to 3.1.1, you can turn off the python-gateway function by changing the value `python-gateway.enabled=false` in configuration file `application.yaml`. If you are using the python gateway, please upgrade to version 3.1.2 or above.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25601", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbDolphinschedulerVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.1.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:dolphinscheduler:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-26  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.22%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-05-23  0.16%  0.22%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-02  0.04%  0.13%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/25g77jqczp3t8cz56hk1p65q7m6c64rf", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-25601: Apache DolphinScheduler 3.0.0 to 3.1.1 python gateway has\u00a0improper authentication-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/20/10", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-25601: Apache DolphinScheduler 3.0.0 to 3.1.1 python gateway has\u00a0improper authenticationMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
