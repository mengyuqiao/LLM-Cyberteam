{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30838", "Description": "PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. Prior to versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, the `ValidateCore::isCleanHTML()` method of Prestashop misses hijackable events which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection, allowed by the presence of pre-setup `@keyframes` methods. This XSS, which hijacks HTML attributes, can be triggered without any interaction by the visitor/administrator, which makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS attack. Contrary to other attacks which target HTML attributes and are triggered without user interaction (such as onload / onerror which suffer from a very limited scope), this one can hijack every HTML element, which increases the danger due to a complete HTML elements scope. Versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9 contain a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30838", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPrestashop\u00bbPrestashopVersions  before (<) 1.7.8.9cpe:2.3:a:prestashop:prestashop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPrestashop\u00bbPrestashopVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.0.4cpe:2.3:a:prestashop:prestashop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-30  0.24%  0.25%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-15  0.21%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-05  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-01  0.09%  0.20%  +0.11 \n 5  2024-03-25  0.07%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-03-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-05-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-fh7r-996q-gvcp", "ref_desc": "Possible XSS injection through Validate::isCleanHTML method \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/46408ae4b02f3b8b1bb6e9dc63af5bcd858abd9c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-fh7r-996q-gvcp \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop@46408ae \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/dc682192df0e4b0d656a8e645b29ca1b9dbe3693", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-fh7r-996q-gvcp \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop@dc68219 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
