{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28848", "Description": "user_oidc is the OIDC connect user backend for Nextcloud, an open source collaboration platform. A vulnerability in versions 1.0.0 until 1.3.0 effectively allowed an attacker to bypass the state protection as they could just copy the expected state token from the first request to their second request. Users should upgrade user_oidc to 1.3.0 to receive a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28848", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbUser OidcVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:user_oidc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/user_oidc/pull/580", "ref_desc": "Do not expose the expected code when it does not match by julien-nc \u00b7 Pull Request #580 \u00b7 nextcloud/user_oidc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1878381", "ref_desc": "HackerOneThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-52hv-xw32-wf7f", "ref_desc": "CSRF protection on user_oidc login returned the expected token in case of an error \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
