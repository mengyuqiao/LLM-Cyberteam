{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24818", "Description": "RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a NULL pointer dereference. During forwarding of a fragment an uninitialized entry in the reassembly buffer is used. The NULL pointer dereference triggers a hard fault exception resulting in denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, disable support for fragmented IP datagrams or apply the patches manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24818", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRiot-os\u00bbRiotVersions  before (<) 2022.10cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.69% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.68%  0.69%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-14  0.60%  0.68%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-10-04  0.51%  0.60%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-08-25  0.36%  0.51%  +0.15 \n 5  2024-07-29  0.34%  0.36%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-05-26  0.28%  0.34%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-04-30  0.17%  0.28%  +0.12 \n 8  2024-03-24  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-05-04  0.04%  0.14%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-69h9-vj5r-xcg6", "ref_desc": "Null Pointer dereference during fragment forwarding \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/f4df5b4c4f841ccb460930894cf68ab10b55b971", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes [backport 2022.10] by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18820 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/4b23d93868a28edd8ebf2ff4ebe94540f2475008", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes [backport 2022.10] by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18820 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/17c70f7ee0b1445f2941f516f264ed4a096e82b7", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18817 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/aa27ed71fa3e5d48dee1748dcf27b6323ec98a33", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18817 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/0bec3e245ed3815ad6c8cae54673f0021777768b", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18817 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/f4fb746d1acaacc962daeed3aa71aadfe307d20e", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan: Various hardening fixes [backport 2022.10] by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #18820 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
