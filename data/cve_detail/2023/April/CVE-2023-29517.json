{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29517", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. The office document viewer macro was allowing anyone to see any file content from the hosting server, provided that the office server was connected and depending on the permissions of the user running the servlet engine (e.g. tomcat) running XWiki. The same vulnerability also allowed to perform internal requests to resources from the hosting server. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.10.1, 14.4.8, 15.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. It might be possible to workaround this vulnerability by running XWiki in a sandbox with a user with very low privileges on the machine.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29517", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.5andbefore (<) 14.10.1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  before (<) 13.10.11cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.4.8cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-28  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-24  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-18  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-04-29  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20324", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20324] SSRF - Retrieve sensitive data from server - Add Gadget - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-m3c3-9qj7-7xmx", "ref_desc": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-office-viewer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20449", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20449] Server side request forgery (SSRF) with the Office Viewer - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20447", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20447] Office document viewer macro allows anyone to see any file from host - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
