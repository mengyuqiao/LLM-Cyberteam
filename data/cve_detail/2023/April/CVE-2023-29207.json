{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29207", "Description": "XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The Livetable Macro wasn't properly sanitizing column names, thus allowing the insertion of raw HTML code including JavaScript. This vulnerability was also exploitable via the Documents Macro that is included since XWiki 3.5M1 and doesn't require script rights, this can be demonstrated with the syntax `{{documents id=\"example\" count=\"5\" actions=\"false\" columns=\"doc.title, before<script>alert(1)</script>after\"/}}`. Therefore, this can also be exploited by users without script right and in comments. With the interaction of a user with more rights, this could be used to execute arbitrary actions in the wiki, including privilege escalation, remote code execution, information disclosure, modifying or deleting content. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29207", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code;Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.4.6cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 1.9andbefore (<) 13.10.10cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.5andbefore (<) 14.9cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:1.9UpdateMilestone2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:1.9:milestone2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.61% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.50%  0.61%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-11-05  0.51%  0.50%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-05-17  0.45%  0.51%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-04-21  0.39%  0.45%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-04-10  0.30%  0.39%  +0.09 \n 6  2024-03-15  0.26%  0.30%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-02-20  0.26%  0.26%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-04-27  0.06%  0.26%  +0.19 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-6vgh-9r3c-2cxp", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags (XSS) in the LiveTable Macro \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/65ca06c51e7a1d5a579344c7272b2cc9a9a21126", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-15205: Improve escaping in LiveTable \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@65ca06c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-15205", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-15205] Reflected XSS vulnerability in the livetable - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
