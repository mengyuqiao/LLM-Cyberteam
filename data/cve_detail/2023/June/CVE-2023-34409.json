This allows an unauthenticated remote user, when a crafted POST request is made against unauthenticated API routes, to access otherwise protected API routes leading to escalation of privileges and information disclosure.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34409", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nPercona\u00bbMonitoring And ManagementVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.37.1cpe:2.3:a:percona:monitoring_and_management:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.25%  0.28%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-08  0.26%  0.25%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-12  0.14%  0.26%  +0.12 \n 4  2024-05-06  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-06-17  0.05%  0.13%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.percona.com/blog/pmm-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-fixed-in-2-37-1/", "ref_desc": "PMM Authentication Bypass Vulnerability Fixed in 2.37.1Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
