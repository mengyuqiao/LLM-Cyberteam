{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33176", "Description": "BigBlueButton is an open source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn. In affected versions are affected by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. In an `insertDocument` API request the user is able to supply a URL from which the presentation should be downloaded. This URL was being used without having been successfully validated first. An update to the `followRedirect` method in the `PresentationUrlDownloadService` has been made to validate all URLs to be used for presentation download. Two new properties `presentationDownloadSupportedProtocols` and `presentationDownloadBlockedHosts` have also been added to `bigbluebutton.properties` to allow administrators to define what protocols a URL must use and to explicitly define hosts that a presentation cannot be downloaded from. All URLs passed to `insertDocument` must conform to the requirements of the two previously mentioned properties. Additionally, these URLs must resolve to valid addresses, and these addresses must not be local or loopback addresses. There are no workarounds. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version of BigBlueButton.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33176", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebuttonVersions  before (<) 2.5.18cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBigbluebutton\u00bbBigbluebuttonVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andbefore (<) 2.6.9cpe:2.3:a:bigbluebutton:bigbluebutton:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-30  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-26  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-06  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/commit/b18aff32e65a47f1eb2c800e86dcfc7a8fb05e71", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #18045 from paultrudel/ssrf-fix \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton@b18aff3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/18045", "ref_desc": "fix(sec): SSRF fix by paultrudel \u00b7 Pull Request #18045 \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/18052", "ref_desc": "fix(sec): SSRF fix 2.5 by paultrudel \u00b7 Pull Request #18052 \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-3q22-hph2-cff7", "ref_desc": "Blind SSRF When Uploading Presentation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton \u00b7 GitHubVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/R9_ZVws0R-16h72I6aTHvUZe0uE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/commit/43394dade595d0707384e4878357901537352415", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #18052 from paultrudel/ssrf-fix-25 \u00b7 bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton@43394da \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
