{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34449", "Description": "ink! is an embedded domain specific language to write smart contracts in Rust for blockchains built on the Substrate framework. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.2.1, the return value when using delegate call mechanics, either through `CallBuilder::delegate` or `ink_env::invoke_contract_delegate`, is decoded incorrectly. This bug was related to the mechanics around decoding a call's return buffer, which was changed as part of pull request 1450. Since this feature was only released in ink! 4.0.0, no previous versions are affected. Users who have an ink! 4.x series contract should upgrade to 4.2.1 to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34449", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nParity\u00bbInk!\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.2.1cpe:2.3:a:parity:ink\\!:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-16  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-06-20  0.06%  0.12%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-05-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-29  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-253 Incorrect Check of Function Return Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/253/Incorrect-Check-of-Function-Return-Value.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1450", "ref_desc": "Add support for language level errors (`LangError`) by HCastano \u00b7 Pull Request #1450 \u00b7 paritytech/ink \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.rs/ink_env/4.2.0/ink_env/fn.invoke_contract_delegate.html", "ref_desc": "invoke_contract_delegate in ink_env - RustExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.rs/ink_env/4.2.0/ink_env/call/struct.CallBuilder.html#method.delegate", "ref_desc": "CallBuilder in ink_env::call - RustExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/ink/commit/f1407ee9f87e5f64d467a22d26ee88f61db7f3db", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-853p-5678-hv8f \u00b7 paritytech/ink@f1407ee \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/paritytech/ink/security/advisories/GHSA-853p-5678-hv8f", "ref_desc": "Incorrect decoding of storage value when using `DelegateCall` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 paritytech/ink \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
