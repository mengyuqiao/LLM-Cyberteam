{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35933", "Description": "OPenFGA is an open source authorization/permission engine built for developers. OpenFGA versions v1.1.0 and prior are vulnerable to a DoS attack when Check and ListObjects calls are executed against authorization models that contain circular relationship definitions. Users are affected by this vulnerability if they are using OpenFGA v1.1.0 or earlier, and if you are executing `Check` or `ListObjects` calls against a vulnerable authorization model. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.1.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users that do not have circular relationships in their models are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35933", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpenfga\u00bbOpenfgaVersions  before (<) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:openfga:openfga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-28  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-02  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-05-26  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Check", "ref_desc": "Open FGA API Explorer | OpenFGAExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects", "ref_desc": "Open FGA API Explorer | OpenFGAExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-hr9r-8phq-5x8j", "ref_desc": "OpenFGA DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openfga/openfga \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/087ce392595f3c319ab3028b5089118ea4063452", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hr9r-8phq-5x8j \u00b7 openfga/openfga@087ce39 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
