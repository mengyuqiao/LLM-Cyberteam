{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34105", "Description": "SRS is a real-time video server supporting RTMP, WebRTC, HLS, HTTP-FLV, SRT, MPEG-DASH, and GB28181. Prior to versions 5.0.157, 5.0-b1, and 6.0.48, SRS's `api-server` server is vulnerable to a drive-by command injection. An attacker may send a request to the `/api/v1/snapshots` endpoint containing any commands to be executed as part of the body of the POST request. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). Versions 5.0.157, 5.0-b1, and 6.0.48 contain a fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34105", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOssrs\u00bbSimple Realtime ServerVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.18andbefore (<) 6.0.48cpe:2.3:a:ossrs:simple_realtime_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOssrs\u00bbSimple Realtime ServerVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.137andbefore (<) 5.0.157cpe:2.3:a:ossrs:simple_realtime_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "87.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-22  88.51%  87.64%  -0.87 \n 2  2024-10-26  92.75%  88.51%  -4.24 \n 3  2024-09-29  85.00%  92.75%  +7.75 \n 4  2024-09-03  1.54%  85.00%  +83.46 \n 5  2024-07-14  1.41%  1.54%  +0.13 \n 6  2024-06-18  0.71%  1.41%  +0.70 \n 7  2024-06-07  0.55%  0.71%  +0.16 \n 8  2024-05-12  0.57%  0.55%  -0.02 \n 9  2023-07-22  0.56%  0.57%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-07-08  0.45%  0.56%  +0.11 \n 11  2023-06-23  0.07%  0.45%  +0.38 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ossrs/srs/security/advisories/GHSA-vpr5-779c-cx62", "ref_desc": "Command injection in demonstration api-server for HTTP callback. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ossrs/srs \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ossrs/srs/blob/1d11d02e4b82fc3f37e4b048cff483b1581482c1/trunk/research/api-server/server.go#L761", "ref_desc": "srs/server.go at 1d11d02e4b82fc3f37e4b048cff483b1581482c1 \u00b7 ossrs/srs \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ossrs/srs/commit/1d878c2daaf913ad01c6d0bc2f247116c8050338", "ref_desc": "Fix command injection in api-server for HTTP callback. v5.0.157, v6.0.48 \u00b7 ossrs/srs@1d878c2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
