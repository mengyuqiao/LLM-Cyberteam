{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34243", "Description": "TGstation is a toolset to manage production BYOND servers. In affected versions if a Windows user was registered in tgstation-server (TGS), an attacker could discover their username by brute-forcing the login endpoint with an invalid password. When a valid Windows logon was found, a distinct response would be generated. This issue has been addressed in version 5.12.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may be mitigated by rate-limiting API calls with software that sits in front of TGS in the HTTP pipeline such as fail2ban.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34243", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTgstation13\u00bbTgstation-serverVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0.0andbefore (<) 5.12.5cpe:2.3:a:tgstation13:tgstation-server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-10  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-08  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/security/advisories/GHSA-w3jx-4x93-76ph", "ref_desc": "Windows user names registered in TGS can be discovered by brute-force logon attempts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tgstation/tgstation-server \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/pull/1526", "ref_desc": "Fix 500 error on entering a registered Windows login with invalid password by Cyberboss \u00b7 Pull Request #1526 \u00b7 tgstation/tgstation-server \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
