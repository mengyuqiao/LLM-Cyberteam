{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32312", "Description": "UmbracoIdentityExtensions is an Umbraco add-on package that enables easy extensibility points for ASP.Net Identity integration. In affected versions client secrets are not required which may expose some endpoints to untrusted actors. Since Umbraco is not a single-page application, the implicit flow is not safe. For traditional MVC applications, it is recommended to use the authorization code flow, which requires the client to authenticate with the authorization server using a client secret. This flow provides better security, as it involves exchanging an authorization code for an access token and/or ID token, rather than directly returning tokens in the URL fragment. This issue has been patched in commit `e792429f9` and a release to Nuget is pending. Users are advised to upgrade when possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32312", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco Identity Extensibility\u00bbForUmbracoVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_identity_extensibility:*:*:*:*:*:umbraco:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-11  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-15  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-09  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoIdentityExtensions/commit/e792429f9d1fa25c1ba4f7a61d23ee02fedd6dc9", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-f2rf-8mwf-6jfh \u00b7 umbraco/UmbracoIdentityExtensions@e792429 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoIdentityExtensions/security/advisories/GHSA-f2rf-8mwf-6jfh", "ref_desc": "Client secret not mandatory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 umbraco/UmbracoIdentityExtensions \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/security/external-login-providers", "ref_desc": "External login providers - Umbraco CMSProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoIdentityExtensions/pull/53", "ref_desc": "Release/2.0 by RyuLindow \u00b7 Pull Request #53 \u00b7 umbraco/UmbracoIdentityExtensions \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
