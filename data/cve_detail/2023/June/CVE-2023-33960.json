{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33960", "Description": "OpenProject is web-based project management software. For any OpenProject installation, a `robots.txt` file is generated through the server to denote which routes shall or shall not be accessed by crawlers. These routes contain project identifiers of all public projects in the instance. Prior to version 12.5.6, even if the entire instance is marked as `Login required` and prevents all truly anonymous access, the `/robots.txt` route remains publicly available.\n\nVersion 12.5.6 has a fix for this issue. Alternatively, users can download a patchfile to apply the patch to any OpenProject version greater than 10.0 As a workaround, one may mark any public project as non-public and give anyone in need of access to the project a membership.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33960", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nOpenproject\u00bbOpenprojectVersions  before (<) 12.5.6cpe:2.3:a:openproject:openproject:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-05  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-03  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-06-07  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-05-01  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-06-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-xjfc-fqm3-95q8", "ref_desc": "Project identifier information leakage through robots.txt \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opf/openproject \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/opf/openproject/pull/12708.patch", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://community.openproject.org/wp/48324", "ref_desc": "Sign in | OpenProject CommunityPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/releases/tag/v12.5.6", "ref_desc": "Release OpenProject 12.5.6 \u00b7 opf/openproject \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/12708", "ref_desc": "Fix/robots txt login required by oliverguenther \u00b7 Pull Request #12708 \u00b7 opf/openproject \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
