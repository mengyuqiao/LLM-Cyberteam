{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36476", "Description": "calamares-nixos-extensions provides Calamares branding and modules for NixOS, a distribution of GNU/Linux. Users of calamares-nixos-extensions version 0.3.12 and prior who installed NixOS through the graphical calamares installer, with an unencrypted `/boot`, on either non-UEFI systems or with a LUKS partition different from `/` have their LUKS key file in `/boot` as a plaintext CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of version 0.3.13 to backport to NixOS 22.11, 23.05, and unstable channels. Expert users who have a copy of their data may, as a workaround, re-encrypt the LUKS partition(s) themselves.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36476", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nNixos\u00bbCalamares-nixos-extensionsVersions  before (<) 0.3.13cpe:2.3:a:nixos:calamares-nixos-extensions:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-07-08  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vlinkz/calamares-nixos-extensions/commit/837ca4da5521a74d3b5ca6f7b88890a6713faa22", "ref_desc": "fix luks \u00b7 vlinkz/calamares-nixos-extensions@837ca4d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/osresearch/heads/issues/1348", "ref_desc": "LUKS encrypted NixOS installation does not boot \u00b7 Issue #1348 \u00b7 osresearch/heads \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww", "ref_desc": "`calamares-nixos-extensions` LUKS keyfile exposure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tgpvcxQCTeucEGgZ2FLxkS40V8I.html"}]}
