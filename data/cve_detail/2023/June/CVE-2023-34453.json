{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34453", "Description": "snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error.\n\nThe function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nThe same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34453", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nXerial\u00bbSnappy-javaVersions  before (<) 1.1.10.1cpe:2.3:a:xerial:snappy-java:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-21  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-15  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/BitShuffle.java", "ref_desc": "snappy-java/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/BitShuffle.java at master \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/820e2e074c58748b41dbd547f4edba9e108ad905", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-pqr6-cmr2-h8hf \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java@820e2e0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-pqr6-cmr2-h8hf", "ref_desc": "Integer overflow in shuffle leads to DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/05c39b2ca9b5b7b39611529cc302d3d796329611/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/BitShuffle.java#L107", "ref_desc": "snappy-java/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/BitShuffle.java at 05c39b2ca9b5b7b39611529cc302d3d796329611 \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
