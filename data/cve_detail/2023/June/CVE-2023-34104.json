{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34104", "Description": "fast-xml-parser is an open source, pure javascript xml parser. fast-xml-parser allows special characters in entity names, which are not escaped or sanitized. Since the entity name is used for creating a regex for searching and replacing entities in the XML body, an attacker can abuse it for denial of service (DoS) attacks. By crafting an entity name that results in an intentionally bad performing regex and utilizing it in the entity replacement step of the parser, this can cause the parser to stall for an indefinite amount of time. This problem has been resolved in v4.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using DOCTYPE parsing by setting the `processEntities: false` option.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34104", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFast-xml-parser Project\u00bbFast-xml-parser\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.2.4cpe:2.3:a:fast-xml-parser_project:fast-xml-parser:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-08  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-12  0.05%  0.12%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-01-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-14  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/commit/39b0e050bb909e8499478657f84a3076e39ce76c", "ref_desc": "fix security bug \u00b7 NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser@39b0e05 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/commit/a4bdced80369892ee413bf08e28b78795a2b0d5b", "ref_desc": "fix #546: Support complex entity value \u00b7 NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser@a4bdced \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-6w63-h3fj-q4vw", "ref_desc": "Regex Injection via Doctype Entities \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
