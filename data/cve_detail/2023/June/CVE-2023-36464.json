{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36464", "Description": "pypdf is an open source, pure-python PDF library. In affected versions an attacker may craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if `__parse_content_stream` is executed. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted text from such a PDF. This issue was introduced in pull request #969 and resolved in pull request #1828. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may modify the line `while peek not in (b\"\\r\", b\"\\n\")` in `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py` to `while peek not in (b\"\\r\", b\"\\n\", b\"\")`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36464", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPypdf2 Project\u00bbPypdf2Versions  from including (>=) 2.2.0cpe:2.3:a:pypdf2_project:pypdf2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPypdf Project\u00bbPypdfVersions  before (<) 3.9.0cpe:2.3:a:pypdf_project:pypdf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1828", "ref_desc": "BUG: Prevent infinite loop when no character follows after a comment by exiledkingcc \u00b7 Pull Request #1828 \u00b7 py-pdf/pypdf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvm-4w3v-6mr8", "ref_desc": "Possible Infinite Loop when a comment isn't followed by a character \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 py-pdf/pypdf \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/969", "ref_desc": "improved ExtractText(3) by pubpub-zz \u00b7 Pull Request #969 \u00b7 py-pdf/pypdf \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
