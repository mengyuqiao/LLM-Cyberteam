{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34102", "Description": "Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework. The polymorphic field type stores the classes to operate on when updating a record with user input, and does not validate them in the back end. This can lead to unexpected behavior, remote code execution, or application crashes when viewing a manipulated record. This issue has been addressed in commit `ec117882d` which is expected to be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to limit access to untrusted users until a new release is made.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34102", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nAvohq\u00bbAVO\u00bbForRubyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.33.2cpe:2.3:a:avohq:avo:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nAvohq\u00bbAVO\u00bbVersion:3.0.0UpdatePre12ForRubycpe:2.3:a:avohq:avo:3.0.0:pre12:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-07  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-11  0.11%  0.22%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-04-11  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-15  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-06-13  0.05%  0.13%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-470 Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/470/Use-of-Externally-Controlled-Input-to-Select-Classes-or-Code.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/commit/ec117882ddb1b519481bdd046dc3cfa4474e6e17", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-86h2-2g4g-29qx \u00b7 avo-hq/avo@ec11788 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/security/advisories/GHSA-86h2-2g4g-29qx", "ref_desc": "Possible unsafe reflection / partial DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 avo-hq/avo \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
