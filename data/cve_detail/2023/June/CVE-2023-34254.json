{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34254", "Description": "The GLPI Agent is a generic management agent. Prior to version 1.5, if glpi-agent is running remoteinventory task against an Unix platform with ssh command, an administrator user on the remote can manage to inject a command in a specific workflow the agent would run with the privileges it uses. In the case, the agent is running with administration privileges, a malicious user could gain high privileges on the computer glpi-agent is running on. A malicious user could also disclose all remote accesses the agent is configured with for remoteinventory task. This vulnerability has been patched in glpi-agent 1.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34254", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpi AgentVersions  before (<) 1.5cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi_agent:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-03  0.15%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.08%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-05-23  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-39vc-hxgm-j465", "ref_desc": "Remoteinventory task command injection when using ssh command mode \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi-agent \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi-agent/blob/dd313ee0914becf74c0e48cb512765210043b478/Changes#L98", "ref_desc": "glpi-agent/Changes at dd313ee0914becf74c0e48cb512765210043b478 \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi-agent \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
