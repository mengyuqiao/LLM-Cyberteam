{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35938", "Description": "Tuleap is a Free & Open Source Suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. When switching from a project visibility that allows restricted users to `Private without restricted`, restricted users that are project administrators keep this access right. Restricted users that were project administrators before the visibility switch keep the possibility to access the project and do some administration actions. This issue has been resolved in Tuleap version 14.9.99.63. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35938", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEnalean\u00bbTuleap\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  before (<) 14.10-1cpe:2.3:a:enalean:tuleap:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nEnalean\u00bbTuleap\u00bb     CommunityEditionVersions  before (<) 14.9.99.63cpe:2.3:a:enalean:tuleap:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-05  0.11%  0.20%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-05-29  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-07-11  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tuleap.net/plugins/tracker/?aid=32278", "ref_desc": "Removed project admin restricted users are not remove at project - request #32278 - Requests - TuleapIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tuleap.net/plugins/git/tuleap/tuleap/stable?a=commit&h=a108186e7538676c4bf6e615f793f3b787a09b91", "ref_desc": "Git - TuleapPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/commit/a108186e7538676c4bf6e615f793f3b787a09b91", "ref_desc": "Close request #32278 Removed restricted users are not remove at proje\u2026 \u00b7 Enalean/tuleap@a108186 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/security/advisories/GHSA-rq42-cv6q-3m9q", "ref_desc": "Removed project admin restricted users are not removed at project visibility switch \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Enalean/tuleap \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
