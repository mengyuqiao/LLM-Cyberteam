{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26134", "Description": "Versions of the package git-commit-info before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection such that the package-exported method gitCommitInfo () fails to sanitize its parameter commit, which later flows into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands once they control the hash content.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26134", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGit-commit-info Project\u00bbGit-commit-info\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.0.2cpe:2.3:a:git-commit-info_project:git-commit-info:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-30  0.19%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-04  0.17%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-28  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-04-11  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-01-22  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-01-03  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 7  2023-11-08  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-09-10  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 9  2023-07-08  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-07-07  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/JPeer264/node-git-commit-info/issues/24", "ref_desc": "Potential command injection vulnerability in git-commit-info \u00b7 Issue #24 \u00b7 JPeer264/node-git-commit-info \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITCOMMITINFO-5740174", "ref_desc": "Command Injection in git-commit-info | CVE-2023-26134 | SnykExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/JPeer264/node-git-commit-info/commit/f7c491ede51f886a988af9b266797cb24591d18c", "ref_desc": "Fix: validate commit hashes before executing them | closes #24 \u00b7 JPeer264/node-git-commit-info@f7c491e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
