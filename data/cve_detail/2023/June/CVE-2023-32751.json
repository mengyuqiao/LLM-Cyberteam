{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32751", "Description": "Pydio Cells through 4.1.2 allows XSS. Pydio Cells implements the download of files using presigned URLs which are generated using the Amazon AWS SDK for JavaScript [1]. The secrets used to sign these URLs are hardcoded and exposed through the JavaScript files of the web application. Therefore, it is possible to generate valid signatures for arbitrary download URLs. By uploading an HTML file and modifying the download URL to serve the file inline instead of as an attachment, any included JavaScript code is executed when the URL is opened in a browser, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32751", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPydio\u00bbCellsVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.1.3cpe:2.3:a:pydio:cells:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPydio\u00bbCellsVersions  before (<) 3.0.12cpe:2.3:a:pydio:cells:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-14  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-05-20  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-14  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 5  2024-04-03  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 6  2024-02-27  0.09%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 7  2024-01-25  0.11%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 8  2023-12-22  0.57%  0.11%  -0.46 \n 9  2023-12-14  0.17%  0.57%  +0.40 \n 10  2023-11-11  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 11  2023-10-26  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-10-18  0.26%  0.14%  -0.12 \n 13  2023-10-11  0.19%  0.26%  +0.07 \n 14  2023-09-10  0.11%  0.19%  +0.08 \n 15  2023-08-21  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 16  2023-06-17  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/-advisories-publicised-vulnerability-analyses", "ref_desc": "RedTeam Pentesting GmbH - Advisories: Publicised Vulnerability AnalysesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/13prAUYQkz4kLQhJsXFrKeBRGuI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2023-004/", "ref_desc": "RedTeam Pentesting GmbH - Pydio Cells: Cross-Site Scripting via File DownloadExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
