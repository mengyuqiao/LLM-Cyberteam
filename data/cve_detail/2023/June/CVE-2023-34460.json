{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34460", "Description": "Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. The 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the Filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Unix. Previously dotfiles were not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented. Only Tauri applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected. The regression has been patched on version 1.4.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34460", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nTauri\u00bbTauri\u00bbVersion:1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:1.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-03  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-25  0.16%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-29  0.09%  0.16%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-05-23  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-07-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7227", "ref_desc": "fix(core): fix `require_literal_leading_dot` flipped behavior by amrbashir \u00b7 Pull Request #7227 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/066c09a6ea06f42f550d090715e06beb65cd5564", "ref_desc": "fix(core): fix `require_literal_leading_dot` flipped behavior (#7227) \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri@066c09a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-wmff-grcw-jcfm", "ref_desc": "Regression on Filesystem Scope Checks for Dotfiles on Linux and macOS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/6969#discussion_r1232018347", "ref_desc": "feat(core): add option for `require_literal_leading_dot`, closes #6158 by amrbashir \u00b7 Pull Request #6969 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
