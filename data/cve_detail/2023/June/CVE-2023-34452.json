{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34452", "Description": "Grav is a flat-file content management system. In versions 1.7.42 and prior, the \"/forgot_password\" page has a self-reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by injecting a script into the \"email\" parameter of the request. While this vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's browser, the impact is limited as it requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. As of time of publication, a patch is not available. Server-side validation should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34452", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGetgrav\u00bbGravVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.42cpe:2.3:a:getgrav:grav:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-16  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-20  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-23  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-xcr8-cc2j-62fc", "ref_desc": "Self Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in /forgot_password \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getgrav/grav \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
