{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32324", "Description": "OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system. In versions 2.4.2 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack. A buffer overflow vulnerability in the function `format_log_line` could allow remote attackers to cause a DoS on the affected system. Exploitation of the vulnerability can be triggered when the configuration file `cupsd.conf` sets the value of `loglevel `to `DEBUG`. No known patches or workarounds exist at time of publication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32324", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpenprinting\u00bbCupsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.4.2cpe:2.3:a:openprinting:cups:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-03  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-09  0.13%  0.07%  -0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/security/advisories/GHSA-cxc6-w2g7-69p7", "ref_desc": "Heap buffer overflow in cupsd \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenPrinting/cups \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00001.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3440-1] cups security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
