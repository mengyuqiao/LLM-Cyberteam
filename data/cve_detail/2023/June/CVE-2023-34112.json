{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34112", "Description": "JavaCPP Presets is a project providing Java distributions of native C++ libraries. All the actions in the `bytedeco/javacpp-presets` use the `github.event.head_commit.message?` parameter in an insecure way. For example, the commit message is used in a run statement - resulting in a command injection vulnerability due to string interpolation. No exploitation has been reported. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.9. Users of JavaCPP Presets are advised to upgrade as a precaution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34112", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBytedeco\u00bbJavacpp PresetsVersions  before (<) 1.5.9cpe:2.3:a:bytedeco:javacpp_presets:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-14  0.05%  0.11%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-05-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-14  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-11-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-10  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-08-21  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-07-15  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-06-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/", "ref_desc": "Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 2: Untrusted input | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cnUbNXWMpwLVHiT6fB5Xtz4U36s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/security/advisories/GHSA-36rx-hq22-jm5x", "ref_desc": "Github Action Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bytedeco/javacpp-presets \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
