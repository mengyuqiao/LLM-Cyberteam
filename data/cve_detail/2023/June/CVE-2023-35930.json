{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35930", "Description": "SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired, database system for creating and managing security-critical application permissions. Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a `LookupResources` request with 1.22.0 is affected. For example, using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources to allow access to be okay: some subjects that should have access to a resource may not. But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources instead, then some users that shouldn't have access may. Generally, `LookupResources` is not and should not be to gate access in this way - that's what the `Check` API is for. Additionally, version 1.22.0 has included a warning about this bug since its initial release. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.22.2. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35930", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAuthzed\u00bbSpicedb\u00bbVersion:1.22.0cpe:2.3:a:authzed:spicedb:1.22.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-28  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-02  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-26  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-07-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-913 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/913/Improper-Control-of-Dynamically-Managed-Code-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pull/1397", "ref_desc": "Further fixes to context handling in LookupResources and performance improvements by josephschorr \u00b7 Pull Request #1397 \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-m54h-5x5f-5m6r", "ref_desc": "LookupResources may return partial results in v1.22.0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 authzed/spicedb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
