{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34247", "Description": "Keystone is a content management system for Node.JS. There is an open redirect in the `@keystone-6/auth` package versions 7.0.0 and prior, where the redirect leading `/` filter can be bypassed. Users may be redirected to domains other than the relative host, thereby it might be used by attackers to re-direct users to an unexpected location. To mitigate this issue, one may apply a patch from pull request 8626 or avoid using the `@keystone-6/auth` package.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34247", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nKeystonejs\u00bbKeystone\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.0.0cpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-06-24  0.06%  0.05%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8626", "ref_desc": "Removes redirect functionality from `/signin` page to prevent open redirection CVE by dcousens \u00b7 Pull Request #8626 \u00b7 keystonejs/keystone \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-jqxr-vjvv-899m", "ref_desc": "Open redirect in @keystone-6/auth \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 keystonejs/keystone \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
