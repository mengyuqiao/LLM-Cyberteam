{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29401", "Description": "The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is not properly sanitized. A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header. For example, a filename of \"setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt\" will be sent as a file named \"setup.bat\". If the FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file name can modify the Content-Disposition header.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29401", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGin-gonic\u00bbGINVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.1-0.20190301021747-ccb9e902956dandbefore (<) 1.9.1cpe:2.3:a:gin-gonic:gin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-10  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.06%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-05-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-494 Download of Code Without Integrity Check", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/494/Download-of-Code-Without-Integrity-Check.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1737", "ref_desc": "GO-2023-1737 - Go PackagesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3556", "ref_desc": "fix lack of escaping of filename in Content-Disposition by motoyasu-saburi \u00b7 Pull Request #3556 \u00b7 gin-gonic/gin \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/releases/tag/v1.9.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.9.1 \u00b7 gin-gonic/gin \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/3555", "ref_desc": "FileAttachment() is vulnerable to Reflect File Download \u00b7 Issue #3555 \u00b7 gin-gonic/gin \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
