{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34238", "Description": "Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React. The Gatsby framework prior to versions 4.25.7 and 5.9.1 contain a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the `__file-code-frame` and `__original-stack-frame` paths, exposed when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`). Any file in scope of the development server could potentially be exposed. It should be noted that by default `gatsby develop` is only accessible via the localhost `127.0.0.1`, and one would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as `--host 0.0.0.0`, `-H 0.0.0.0`, or the `GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0` environment variable. A patch has been introduced in `gatsby@5.9.1` and `gatsby@4.25.7` which mitigates the issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid exposing their development server to the internet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34238", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nGatsbyjs\u00bbGatsby\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 4.25.7cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nGatsbyjs\u00bbGatsby\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.9.1cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-13  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-28  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 5  2023-10-25  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-08-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-22  0.26%  0.05%  -0.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/fc22f4ba3ad7ca5fb3592f38f4f0ca8ae60b4bf7", "ref_desc": "fix(gatsby): don't serve codeframes for files outside of compilation \u2026 \u00b7 gatsbyjs/gatsby@fc22f4b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/security/advisories/GHSA-c6f8-8r25-c4gc", "ref_desc": "Local File Inclusion vulnerability in Gatsby develop server prior to versions 4.25.7 and 5.9.1 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gatsbyjs/gatsby \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/ae5a654eb346b2e7a9d341b809b2f82d34c0f17c", "ref_desc": "fix(gatsby): don't serve codeframes for files outside of compilation \u2026 \u00b7 gatsbyjs/gatsby@ae5a654 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
