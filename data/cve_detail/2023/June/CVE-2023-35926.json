{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35926", "Description": "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. The Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires sandbox, as it by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2`, but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities  that may not have a fix, the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library. A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by user input data. This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35926", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbBackstageVersions  before (<) 1.15.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:backstage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.74% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-24  0.67%  0.74%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-06-28  0.29%  0.67%  +0.38 \n 3  2024-06-17  0.26%  0.29%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-22  0.19%  0.26%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-04-28  0.18%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-06-30  0.09%  0.18%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-wg6p-jmpc-xjmr", "ref_desc": "Insecure sandbox in Backstage Scaffolder plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/fb7375507d56faedcb7bb3665480070593c8949a", "ref_desc": "feat: replace vm2 sandbox with isolated-vm \u00b7 backstage/backstage@fb73755 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/v1.15.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.15.0 \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
