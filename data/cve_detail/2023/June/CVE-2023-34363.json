{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34363", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Progress DataDirect Connect for ODBC before 08.02.2770 for Oracle. When using Oracle Advanced Security (OAS) encryption, if an error is encountered initializing the encryption object used to encrypt data, the code falls back to a different encryption mechanism that uses an insecure random number generator to generate the private key. It is possible for a well-placed attacker to predict the output of this random number generator, which could lead to an attacker decrypting traffic between the driver and the database server. The vulnerability does not exist if SSL / TLS encryption is used.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34363", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nProgress\u00bbDatadirect Odbc Oracle Wire Protocol DriverVersions  before (<) 08.02.2770cpe:2.3:a:progress:datadirect_odbc_oracle_wire_protocol_driver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-05-09  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 4  2023-06-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://progress.com", "ref_desc": "Develop, Deploy & Manage High-Impact Business Apps | Progress SoftwareProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8m4orpqXfkpgsBIg_iZPOlyxayY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://community.progress.com/s/article/Security-vulnerabilities-in-DataDirect-ODBC-Oracle-Wire-Protocol-driver-June-2023", "ref_desc": "Security vulnerabilities in DataDirect ODBC Oracle Wire Protocol driver - June 2023 - Progress CommunityVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Pk6jXDGnSlvTpx9DcTQEUmHXwgk.html"}]}
