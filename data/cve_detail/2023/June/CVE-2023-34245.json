{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34245", "Description": "@udecode/plate-link is the link handler for the udecode/plate rich-text editor plugin system for Slate & React. Affected versions of the link plugin and link UI component do not sanitize URLs to prevent use of the `javascript:` scheme. As a result, links with JavaScript URLs can be inserted into the Plate editor through various means, including opening or pasting malicious content. `@udecode/plate-link` 20.0.0 resolves this issue by introducing an `allowedSchemes` option to the link plugin, defaulting to `['http', 'https', 'mailto', 'tel']`. URLs using a scheme that isn't in this list will not be rendered to the DOM. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade are advised to override the `LinkElement` and `PlateFloatingLink` components with implementations that explicitly check the URL scheme before rendering any anchor elements.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34245", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nUdecode\u00bbPlateVersions  before (<) 20.0.0cpe:2.3:a:udecode:plate:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-15  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-09  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/udecode/plate/security/advisories/GHSA-4882-hxpr-hrvm", "ref_desc": "Links may contain URLs with JavaScript scheme \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 udecode/plate \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/udecode/plate/commit/93dd5712854660874900ae12e4d8e6ff28089eb7", "ref_desc": "Apply isUrl option to pasted links #2239 (#2240) \u00b7 udecode/plate@93dd571 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
