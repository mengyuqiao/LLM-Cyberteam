{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32715", "Description": "In the Splunk App for Lookup File Editing versions below 4.0.1, a user can insert potentially malicious JavaScript code into the app, which causes that code to run on the user\u2019s machine. The app itself does not contain the potentially malicious JavaScript code. The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser, and requires additional user interaction to trigger. The attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability at will.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32715", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSplunk\u00bbSplunk App For Lookup File EditingVersions  before (<) 4.0.1cpe:2.3:a:splunk:splunk_app_for_lookup_file_editing:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-03  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://advisory.splunk.com/advisories/SVD-2023-0610", "ref_desc": "SVD-2023-0610 | Splunk Vulnerability DisclosureVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
