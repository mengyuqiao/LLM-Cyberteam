{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33243", "Description": "RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the web interface of STARFACE as well as its REST API allows authentication using the SHA512 hash of the password instead of the cleartext password. While storing password hashes instead of cleartext passwords in an application's database generally has become best practice to protect users' passwords in case of a database compromise, this is rendered ineffective when allowing to authenticate using the password hash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33243", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nStarface\u00bbStarfaceVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.3.0.10cpe:2.3:a:starface:starface:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.93% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  2.36%  2.93%  +0.57 \n 2  2024-11-12  2.38%  2.36%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-07-17  2.75%  2.38%  -0.37 \n 4  2024-06-21  2.16%  2.75%  +0.59 \n 5  2024-05-27  2.28%  2.16%  -0.13 \n 6  2024-05-15  1.89%  2.28%  +0.40 \n 7  2024-05-04  1.63%  1.89%  +0.26 \n 8  2024-04-21  1.56%  1.63%  +0.07 \n 9  2023-11-26  1.41%  1.56%  +0.15 \n 10  2023-07-08  0.90%  1.41%  +0.51 \n 11  2023-07-04  0.10%  0.90%  +0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/-advisories-publicised-vulnerability-analyses", "ref_desc": "RedTeam Pentesting GmbH - Advisories: Publicised Vulnerability AnalysesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/13prAUYQkz4kLQhJsXFrKeBRGuI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2022-004/-starface-authentication-with-password-hash-possible", "ref_desc": "RedTeam Pentesting GmbH - STARFACE: Authentication with Password Hash PossibleExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
