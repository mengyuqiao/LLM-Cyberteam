{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32750", "Description": "Pydio Cells through 4.1.2 allows SSRF. For longer running processes, Pydio Cells allows for the creation of jobs, which are run in the background. The job \"remote-download\" can be used to cause the backend to send a HTTP GET request to a specified URL and save the response to a new file. The response file is then available in a user-specified folder in Pydio Cells.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32750", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nPydio\u00bbCellsVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.1.3cpe:2.3:a:pydio:cells:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPydio\u00bbCellsVersions  before (<) 3.0.12cpe:2.3:a:pydio:cells:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.96% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.84%  0.96%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-11-05  1.19%  0.84%  -0.35 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.93%  1.19%  +0.26 \n 4  2024-05-20  0.78%  0.93%  +0.16 \n 5  2024-05-08  0.68%  0.78%  +0.10 \n 6  2024-04-27  0.83%  0.68%  -0.15 \n 7  2023-11-19  1.56%  0.83%  -0.73 \n 8  2023-07-10  1.51%  1.56%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-07-08  0.68%  1.51%  +0.83 \n 10  2023-06-17  0.14%  0.68%  +0.53 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/-advisories-publicised-vulnerability-analyses", "ref_desc": "RedTeam Pentesting GmbH - Advisories: Publicised Vulnerability AnalysesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/13prAUYQkz4kLQhJsXFrKeBRGuI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2023-005/", "ref_desc": "RedTeam Pentesting GmbH - Pydio Cells: Server-Side Request ForgeryExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
