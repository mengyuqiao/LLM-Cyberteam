{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34230", "Description": "snowflake-connector-net, the Snowflake Connector for .NET, is vulnerable to command injection prior to version 2.0.18 via SSO URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 2.0.18 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34230", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSnowflake\u00bbSnowflake Connector\u00bbFor.netVersions  before (<) 2.0.18cpe:2.3:a:snowflake:snowflake_connector:*:*:*:*:*:.net:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.22%  0.22%  0.00 \n 2  2024-07-10  0.26%  0.22%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.27%  0.26%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-05-08  0.27%  0.27%  0.00 \n 5  2023-07-18  0.19%  0.27%  +0.08 \n 6  2023-07-15  0.24%  0.19%  -0.05 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.19%  0.24%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-06-21  0.05%  0.19%  +0.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net/security/advisories/GHSA-223g-8w3x-98wr", "ref_desc": "Snowflake Connector .Net Security Advisory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
