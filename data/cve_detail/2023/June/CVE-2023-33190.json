{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33190", "Description": "Sealos is an open source cloud operating system distribution based on the Kubernetes kernel. In versions of Sealos prior to 4.2.1-rc4 an improper configuration of role based access control (RBAC) permissions resulted in an attacker being able to obtain cluster control permissions, which could control the entire cluster deployed with Sealos, as well as hundreds of pods and other resources within the cluster. This issue has been addressed in version 4.2.1-rc4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33190", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSealos Project\u00bbSealosVersions  before (<) 4.2.1cpe:2.3:o:sealos_project:sealos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSealos Project\u00bbSealos\u00bbVersion:4.2.1UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:o:sealos_project:sealos:4.2.1:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSealos Project\u00bbSealos\u00bbVersion:4.2.1UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:o:sealos_project:sealos:4.2.1:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSealos Project\u00bbSealos\u00bbVersion:4.2.1UpdateRC3cpe:2.3:o:sealos_project:sealos:4.2.1:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-31  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-05  0.09%  0.20%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-05-29  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/labring/sealos/security/advisories/GHSA-74j8-w7f9-pp62", "ref_desc": "Improper configuration of RBAC permissions obtaining cluster control permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 labring/sealos \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/labring/sealos/commit/4cdf52e55666864e5f90ed502e9fc13e18985b7b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-74j8-w7f9-pp62 \u00b7 labring/sealos@4cdf52e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
