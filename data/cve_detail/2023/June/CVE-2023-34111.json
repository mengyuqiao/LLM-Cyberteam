{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34111", "Description": "The `Release PR Merged` workflow in the github repo taosdata/grafanaplugin is subject to a command injection vulnerability which allows for arbitrary code execution within the github action context due to the insecure usage of `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}` in a bash command within the GitHub workflow. Attackers can inject malicious commands which will be executed by the workflow. This happens because `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}` is directly passed to bash command on like 25 of the workflow. This may allow an attacker to gain access to secrets which the github action has access to or to otherwise make use of the compute resources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34111", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nTdengine\u00bbGrafana\u00bbForTdengineVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2023-05-22cpe:2.3:a:tdengine:grafana:*:*:*:*:*:tdengine:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-08  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-06-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-09  0.14%  0.07%  -0.07 \n 6  2024-02-16  0.14%  0.14%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-06-14  0.05%  0.14%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/taosdata/grafanaplugin/security/advisories/GHSA-23wp-p848-hcgr", "ref_desc": "Command Injection Vulnerability in `Release PR Merged` Workflow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 taosdata/grafanaplugin \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/", "ref_desc": "Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 2: Untrusted input | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cnUbNXWMpwLVHiT6fB5Xtz4U36s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/taosdata/grafanaplugin/blob/master/.github/workflows/release-pr-merged.yaml#L25", "ref_desc": "grafanaplugin/release-pr-merged.yaml at master \u00b7 taosdata/grafanaplugin \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
