{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36474", "Description": "Interactsh is an open-source tool for detecting out-of-band interactions. Domains configured with interactsh server prior to version 1.0.0 were vulnerable to subdomain takeover for a specific subdomain, i.e `app.` Interactsh server used to create cname entries for `app` pointing to `projectdiscovery.github.io` as default, which intended to used for hosting interactsh web client using GitHub pages. This is a security issue with a self-hosted interactsh server in which the user may not have configured a web client but still have a CNAME entry pointing to GitHub pages, making them vulnerable to subdomain takeover. This allows a threat actor to host / run arbitrary client side code (cross-site scripting) in a user's browser when browsing the vulnerable subdomain. Version 1.0.0 fixes this issue by making CNAME optional, rather than default.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36474", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nProjectdiscovery\u00bbInteractshVersions  before (<) 1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:projectdiscovery:interactsh:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-30  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-04  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-28  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/security/advisories/GHSA-m36x-mgfh-8g78", "ref_desc": "Interactsh server < 1.0.0 Subdomain Takeover \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 projectdiscovery/interactsh \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/issues/136", "ref_desc": "deprecate default cname entry \u00b7 Issue #136 \u00b7 projectdiscovery/interactsh \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more/", "ref_desc": "Hostile Subdomain Takeover using Heroku/Github/Desk + more - Detectify LabsTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/pull/155", "ref_desc": "Making app CNAME optional by Mzack9999 \u00b7 Pull Request #155 \u00b7 projectdiscovery/interactsh \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
