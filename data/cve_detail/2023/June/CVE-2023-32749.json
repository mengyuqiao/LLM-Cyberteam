{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32749", "Description": "Pydio Cells allows users by default to create so-called external users in order to share files with them. By modifying the HTTP request sent when creating such an external user, it is possible to assign the new user arbitrary roles. By assigning all roles to a newly created user, access to all cells and non-personal workspaces is granted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32749", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPydio\u00bbCellsVersions  from including (>=) 4.1.0andbefore (<) 4.1.3cpe:2.3:a:pydio:cells:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPydio\u00bbCellsVersions  before (<) 3.0.12cpe:2.3:a:pydio:cells:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.69% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-30  0.70%  0.69%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-17  0.93%  0.70%  -0.24 \n 3  2024-06-14  0.98%  0.93%  -0.05 \n 4  2024-06-03  0.70%  0.98%  +0.28 \n 5  2024-05-08  0.70%  0.70%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-05-02  0.34%  0.70%  +0.36 \n 7  2023-11-11  0.35%  0.34%  -0.02 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.30%  0.35%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-06-16  0.08%  0.30%  +0.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2023-003/-pydio-cells-unauthorised-role-assignments", "ref_desc": "RedTeam Pentesting GmbH - Pydio Cells: Unauthorised Role AssignmentsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/-advisories-publicised-vulnerability-analyses", "ref_desc": "RedTeam Pentesting GmbH - Advisories: Publicised Vulnerability AnalysesThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/13prAUYQkz4kLQhJsXFrKeBRGuI.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172645/Pydio-Cells-4.1.2-Privilege-Escalation.html", "ref_desc": "Pydio Cells 4.1.2 Privilege Escalation \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/May/18", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [RT-SA-2023-003] Pydio Cells: Unauthorised Role AssignmentsExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
