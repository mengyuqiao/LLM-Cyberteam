{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33567", "Description": "An unauthorized access vulnerability has been discovered in ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy versions where ROS_VERSION is 2 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION is 3. This vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized access to multiple ROS2 nodes remotely. Unauthorized access to these nodes could result in compromised system integrity, the execution of arbitrary commands, and disclosure of sensitive information. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33567", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nOpenrobotics\u00bbRobot Operating System\u00bbVersion:2UpdateFoxycpe:2.3:a:openrobotics:robot_operating_system:2:foxy:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-27  0.07%  0.04%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-05-02  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-07  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jXt4A209jgtGWXeoSEyBUKOOMxg.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Mgg78h5_k6LWdnxzrs9Ow5VyHKA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ObdzCuH3Co0iyLfzlZUUdbs8JH0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s50QOweWZO8DnZiKflxrVT-5Jes.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/16yashpatel/CVE-2023-33567", "ref_desc": "GitHub - 16yashpatel/CVE-2023-33567: Unauthorized Access Vulnerability in ROS2 Foxy FitzroyThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
