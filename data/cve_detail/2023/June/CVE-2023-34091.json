{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34091", "Description": "Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. In versions of Kyverno prior to 1.10.0, resources which have the `deletionTimestamp` field defined can bypass validate, generate, or mutate-existing policies, even in cases where the `validationFailureAction` field is set to `Enforce`. This situation occurs as resources pending deletion were being consciously exempted by Kyverno, as a way to reduce processing load as policies are typically not applied to objects which are being deleted. However, this could potentially result in allowing a malicious user to leverage the Kubernetes finalizers feature by setting a finalizer which causes the Kubernetes API server to set the `deletionTimestamp` and then not completing the delete operation as a way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno policy. Note that this is not applicable to Kubernetes Pods but, as an example, a Kubernetes Service resource can be manipulated using an indefinite finalizer to bypass policies. This is resolved in Kyverno 1.10.0. There is no known workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34091", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nNirmata\u00bbKyverno\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.10.0cpe:2.3:a:nirmata:kyverno:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-01  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2023-06-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-hq4m-4948-64cc", "ref_desc": "A resource with a deletionTimestamp may allow policy circumvention \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kyverno/kyverno \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases/tag/v1.10.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.10.0 \u00b7 kyverno/kyverno \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
