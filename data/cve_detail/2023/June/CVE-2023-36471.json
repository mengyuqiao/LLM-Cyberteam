{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36471", "Description": "Xwiki commons is the common modules used by other XWiki top level projects. The HTML sanitizer that is included in XWiki since version 14.6RC1 allowed form and input HTML tags. In the context of XWiki, this allows an attacker without script right to either create forms that can be used for phishing attacks or also in the context of a sheet, the attacker could add an input like `{{html}}<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"content\" value=\"{{groovy}}println(&quot;Hello from Groovy!&quot;)\" />{{/html}}` that would allow remote code execution when it is submitted by an admin (the sheet is rendered as part of the edit form). The attacker would need to ensure that the edit form looks plausible, though, which can be non-trivial as without script right the attacker cannot display the regular content of the document. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.2RC1 by removing the central form-related tags from the list of allowed tags. Users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround an admin can manually disallow the tags by adding `form, input, select, textarea, button` to the configuration option `xml.htmlElementSanitizer.forbidTags` in the `xwiki.properties` configuration file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36471", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbCommonsVersions  from including (>=) 14.6andbefore (<) 14.10.6cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:commons:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbCommons\u00bbVersion:15.0cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:commons:15.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbCommons\u00bbVersion:15.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:commons:15.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbCommons\u00bbVersion:15.1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:commons:15.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbCommons\u00bbVersion:15.1UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:commons:15.1:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-31  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-07-05  0.29%  0.24%  -0.06 \n 3  2024-05-29  0.24%  0.29%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-05-05  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-08-01  0.27%  0.21%  -0.06 \n 6  2023-07-11  0.06%  0.27%  +0.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/security/advisories/GHSA-6pqf-c99p-758v", "ref_desc": "HTML sanitizer allows form elements in restricted in org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-commons \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2634", "ref_desc": "[XCOMMONS-2634] Privilege escalation (PR) from edit right through form elements in HTML macros - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/99484d48e899a68a1b6e33d457825b776c6fe8c3", "ref_desc": "XCOMMONS-2634: Disallow form-related tags in HTML sanitizer \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-commons@99484d4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
