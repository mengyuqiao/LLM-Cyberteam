{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34242", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Prior to version 1.13.4, when Gateway API is enabled in Cilium, the absence of a check on the namespace in which a ReferenceGrant is created could result in Cilium unintentionally gaining visibility of secrets (including certificates) and services across namespaces. An attacker on an affected cluster can leverage this issue to use cluster secrets that should not be visible to them, or communicate with services that they should not have access to. Gateway API functionality is disabled by default. This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium release 1.13.4. As a workaround, restrict the creation of `ReferenceGrant` resources to admin users by using Kubernetes RBAC.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34242", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  before (<) 1.13.4cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-06-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-04  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.13.4", "ref_desc": "Release 1.13.4 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-r7wr-4w5q-55m6", "ref_desc": "Information disclosure via incorrect ReferenceGrant handling \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
