{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34101", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet of things devices. In version 4.8 and prior, when processing ICMP DAO packets in the `dao_input_storing` function, the Contiki-NG OS does not verify that the packet buffer is big enough to contain the bytes it needs before accessing them. Up to 16 bytes can be read out of bounds in the `dao_input_storing` function. An attacker can truncate an ICMP packet so that it does not contain enough data, leading to an out-of-bounds read on these lines. The problem has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in release 4.9. As a workaround, one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2435 to patch the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34101", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-16  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-20  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-06-24  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-fp66-ff6x-7w2w", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read when processing ICMP DAO input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2435", "ref_desc": "Add boundary checks to the DAO input function. by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #2435 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
