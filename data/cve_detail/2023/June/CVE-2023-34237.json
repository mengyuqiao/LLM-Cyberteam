{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34237", "Description": "SABnzbd is an open source automated Usenet download tool. A design flaw was discovered in SABnzbd that could allow remote code execution. Manipulating the Parameters setting in the Notification Script functionality allows code execution with the privileges of the SABnzbd process. Exploiting the vulnerabilities requires access to the web interface. Remote exploitation is possible if users[exposed their setup to the internet or other untrusted networks without setting a username/password. By default SABnzbd is only accessible from `localhost`, with no authentication required for the web interface. This issue has been patched in commits `e3a722` and `422b4f` which have been included in the 4.0.2 release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that a username and password have been set if their instance is web accessible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34237", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSabnzbd\u00bbSabnzbdVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 4.0.2cpe:2.3:a:sabnzbd:sabnzbd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-30  2.53%  2.40%  -0.13 \n 2  2024-11-17  2.43%  2.53%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-09-11  1.61%  2.43%  +0.82 \n 4  2024-07-09  2.21%  1.61%  -0.59 \n 5  2024-06-13  1.60%  2.21%  +0.61 \n 6  2024-05-07  1.16%  1.60%  +0.44 \n 7  2024-04-26  1.05%  1.16%  +0.11 \n 8  2024-03-21  0.84%  1.05%  +0.20 \n 9  2024-02-26  1.19%  0.84%  -0.35 \n 10  2024-02-17  0.84%  1.19%  +0.35 \n 11  2023-12-24  0.53%  0.84%  +0.31 \n 12  2023-11-18  0.53%  0.53%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-08-20  0.38%  0.53%  +0.15 \n 14  2023-07-15  0.44%  0.38%  -0.07 \n 15  2023-07-08  0.38%  0.44%  +0.07 \n 16  2023-06-22  0.10%  0.38%  +0.28 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/configuration/4.0/general", "ref_desc": "SABnzbd - Wiki - GeneralVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/commit/e3a722664819d1c7c8fab97144cc299b1c18b429", "ref_desc": "Move Notification Script Parameters to environment variable \u00b7 sabnzbd/sabnzbd@e3a7226 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-11", "ref_desc": "SABnzbd: Remote Code Execution (GLSA 202312-11) \u2014 Gentoo security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/security/advisories/GHSA-hhgh-xgh3-985r", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution via specially crafted script settings \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sabnzbd/sabnzbd \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/commit/422b4fce7bfd56e95a315be0400cdfdc585df7cc", "ref_desc": "Notification Script did not get environment variables \u00b7 sabnzbd/sabnzbd@422b4fc \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
