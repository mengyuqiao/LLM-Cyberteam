{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29723", "Description": "The Glitter Unicorn Wallpaper app for Android 7.0 thru 8.0 allows unauthorized applications to actively request permission to insert data into the database that records information about a user's personal preferences and will be loaded into memory to be read and used when the application is opened. By injecting data, the attacker can force the application to load malicious image URLs and display them in the UI. As the amount of data increases, it will eventually cause the application to trigger an OOM error and crash, resulting in a persistent denial of service attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29723", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGlitter Unicorn Wallpaper Project\u00bbGlitter Unicorn Wallpaper\u00bbForAndroidVersions  from including (>=) 7.0andup to, including, (<=) 8.0cpe:2.3:a:glitter_unicorn_wallpaper_project:glitter_unicorn_wallpaper:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-03  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-06-07  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LianKee/SO-CVEs/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2023-29723/CVE%20detail.md", "ref_desc": "SO-CVEs/CVE detail.md at main \u00b7 LianKee/SO-CVEs \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
