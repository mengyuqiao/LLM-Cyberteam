{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32683", "Description": "Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted framework. A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the `url_preview_url_blacklist` setting potentially allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP addresses allowed by the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` setting (by default this only allows public IPs) and by the limited information returned to the client: 1. For discovered oEmbed URLs, any non-JSON response or a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information is discarded. 2. For discovered image URLs, any non-image response is discarded. Systems which have URL preview disabled (via the `url_preview_enabled` setting) or have not configured a `url_preview_url_blacklist` are not affected. This issue has been addressed in version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade. User unable to upgrade may also disable URL previews.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32683", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.85.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-12  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-06-17  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-06-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-98px-6486-j7qc", "ref_desc": "URL deny list bypass via oEmbed and image URLs when generating previews \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X6DH5A5YEB5LRIPP32OUW25FCGZFCZU2/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: matrix-synapse-1.85.2-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DXVcZNU85DRErATEFJZh9lruCIs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/15601", "ref_desc": "Apply url_preview_url_blacklist to oEmbed and pre-cached images by clokep \u00b7 Pull Request #15601 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
