{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31410", "Description": "A remote unprivileged attacker can intercept the communication via e.g. Man-In-The-Middle, due to the absence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the SICK EventCam App. This lack of encryption in the communication channel can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. The attacker can exploit this weakness to eavesdrop on the communication between the EventCam App and the Client, and potentially manipulate the data being transmitted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31410", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSick\u00bbSick Eventcam Appcpe:2.3:a:sick:sick_eventcam_app:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-05-19  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2023-06-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2023/sca-2023-0005.json", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5yNG3jWdPe5QJSenv3wigkayysU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2023/sca-2023-0005.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iejutKSlZPc0pFQ-paHn86vR-Pc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sick.com/psirt", "ref_desc": "The SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT) | SICKVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v6inTk1Bf2cm1HoZcfS_iK5G0TQ.html"}]}
