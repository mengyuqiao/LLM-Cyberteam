{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33977", "Description": "Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and automated testing. Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous files from being uploaded and Content-Security-Policy definition to prevent cross-site-scripting attacks. The upload validation checks were not 100% robust which left the possibility to circumvent them and upload a potentially dangerous file which allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. Additionally we've discovered that Nginx's `proxy_pass` directive will strip some headers negating protections built into Kiwi TCMS when served behind a reverse proxy. This issue has been addressed in version 12.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade who are serving Kiwi TCMS behind a reverse proxy should make sure that additional header values are still passed to the client browser. If they aren't redefining them inside the proxy configuration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33977", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nKiwitcms\u00bbKiwi TcmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 12.3cpe:2.3:a:kiwitcms:kiwi_tcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-06-12  0.15%  0.12%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-05-18  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-06  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-02-16  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-06-14  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-2fqm-m4r2-fh98", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via unrestricted file upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/6aea9a26-e29a-467b-aa5a-f767f0c2ec96/", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS Via SVG Upload vulnerability found in kiwiExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/blob/master/etc/nginx.conf#L66-L68", "ref_desc": "Kiwi/nginx.conf at master \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/blob/master/etc/nginx.conf#L87", "ref_desc": "Kiwi/nginx.conf at master \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/d789f4b51025de4f8c747c037d02e1b0da80b034", "ref_desc": "Improve upload validation to check for dangerous attributes \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi@d789f4b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
