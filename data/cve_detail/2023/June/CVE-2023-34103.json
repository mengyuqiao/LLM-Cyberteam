{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34103", "Description": "Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework. In affected versions some avo fields are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) when rendering html based content. Attackers do need form edit privilege in order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, but the results are stored and no specific timing is required. This issue has been addressed in commit `7891c01e` which is expected to be included in the next release of avo. Users are advised to configure CSP headers for their application and to limit untrusted user access as a mitigation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34103", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nAvohq\u00bbAVO\u00bbForRubyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.33.2cpe:2.3:a:avohq:avo:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nAvohq\u00bbAVO\u00bbVersion:3.0.0UpdatePre12ForRubycpe:2.3:a:avohq:avo:3.0.0:pre12:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-05  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/commit/7891c01e1fba9ca5d7dbccc43d27f385e5d08563", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5cr9-5jx3-2g39 \u00b7 avo-hq/avo@7891c01 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/security/advisories/GHSA-5cr9-5jx3-2g39", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS (Cross Site Scripting) in html content based fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 avo-hq/avo \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
