{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34455", "Description": "snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to use of an unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1.\n\nThe code in the function hasNextChunk in the fileSnappyInputStream.java checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasn\u2019t possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them as the length of the next chunk.\n\nIn the case that the `compressed` variable is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesn\u2019t test the legality of the `chunkSize` variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code to raise a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which would raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34455", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXerial\u00bbSnappy-javaVersions  before (<) 1.1.10.1cpe:2.3:a:xerial:snappy-java:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-25  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-19  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-17  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-21  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-05-15  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/05c39b2ca9b5b7b39611529cc302d3d796329611/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/SnappyInputStream.java#L388", "ref_desc": "snappy-java/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/SnappyInputStream.java at 05c39b2ca9b5b7b39611529cc302d3d796329611 \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-qcwq-55hx-v3vh", "ref_desc": "Unchecked chunk length leads to DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0009/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-34455 Apache Kafka Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/3bf67857fcf70d9eea56eed4af7c925671e8eaea", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-qcwq-55hx-v3vh \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java@3bf6785 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/SnappyInputStream.java", "ref_desc": "snappy-java/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/SnappyInputStream.java at master \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
