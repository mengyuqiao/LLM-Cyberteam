{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34462", "Description": "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. The `SniHandler` can allocate up to 16MB of heap for each channel during the TLS handshake. When the handler or the channel does not have an idle timeout, it can be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler` to allocate 16MB of heap. The `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake to configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record. For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello` record. Normally the value of the packet should be smaller than the handshake packet but there are not checks done here and the way the code is written, it is possible to craft a packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 4.1.94.Final.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34462", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetty\u00bbNettyVersions  before (<) 4.1.94cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-26  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-28  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-05-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-19  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-08-04  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-07-01  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-6mjq-h674-j845", "ref_desc": "SniHandler 16MB allocation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 netty/netty \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0007/", "ref_desc": "May 2024 IBM Cognos Analytics Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IxBB4Bf1NaUGT7xrTpFGrwfYzx4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0001/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-34462 Apache Netty Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/535da17e45201ae4278c0479e6162bb4127d4c32", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-6mjq-h674-j845 \u00b7 netty/netty@535da17 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5558", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5558-1 nettyCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wEk2cd1ZTR8O_9IdCBj2IV4Njxw.html"}]}
