{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35946", "Description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its dependency cache, it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute a file location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates, Gradle can be made to write files into an unintended location. The file may be written outside the dependency cache or over another file in the dependency cache. This vulnerability could be used to poison the dependency cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the filesystem where the Gradle process has write permissions. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have control over a dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have the ability to modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will refuse to cache dependencies that have path traversal elements in their dependency coordinates. It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version. If you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2, `dependency verification` will make this vulnerability more difficult to exploit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35946", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGradle\u00bbGradleVersions  before (<) 7.6.2cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGradle\u00bbGradleVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.2.0cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-07-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-rv6q-494v", "ref_desc": "Dependency cache path traversal \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commit/859eae2b2acf751ae7db3c9ffefe275aa5da0d5d", "ref_desc": "Fix dependency cache path traversal vulnerability \u00b7 gradle/gradle@859eae2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230731-0003/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-35946 Gradle Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_verification.html", "ref_desc": "Verifying dependenciesProduct;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commit/b07e528feb3a5ffa66bdcc358549edd73e4c8a12", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2h6c-rv6q-494v \u00b7 gradle/gradle@b07e528 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
