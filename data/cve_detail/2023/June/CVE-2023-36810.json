{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36810", "Description": "pypdf is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to unexpected long runtime. This quadratic runtime blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. This issue has been addressed in PR 808 and versions from 1.27.9 include this fix. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36810", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPypdf Project\u00bbPypdfVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.27.8cpe:2.3:a:pypdf_project:pypdf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-01  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-06  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-05-30  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-07-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-07-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-407 Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/407/Inefficient-Algorithmic-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-jrm6-h9cq-8gqw", "ref_desc": "Quadratic runtime with malformed PDF missing xref marker \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 py-pdf/pypdf \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00019.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3497-1] pypdf2 security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/issues/582", "ref_desc": "Quadratic runtime with malformed PDF missing xref marker \u00b7 Issue #582 \u00b7 py-pdf/pypdf \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/808", "ref_desc": "fix pdf reader getting stuck when trying to read large files wihhout xref marker by dsk7 \u00b7 Pull Request #808 \u00b7 py-pdf/pypdf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
