{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34459", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves.\n\nA contract may be vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree.\n\nA contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe.\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 4.9.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34459", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.7.0andbefore (<) 4.9.2cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts Upgradeable\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.7.0andbefore (<) 4.9.2cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts_upgradeable:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-22  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-16  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-354 Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/354/Improper-Validation-of-Integrity-Check-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.9.2", "ref_desc": "Release v4.9.2 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/4d2383e17186be3e8ccf5a442e9686ecc7de1c55", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wprv-93r4-jj2p \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4d2383e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-wprv-93r4-jj2p", "ref_desc": "MerkleProof multiproofs may allow proving arbitrary leaves for specific trees \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
