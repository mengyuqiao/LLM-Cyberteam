{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35932", "Description": "jcvi is a Python library to facilitate genome assembly, annotation, and comparative genomics. A configuration injection happens when user input is considered by the application in an unsanitized format and can reach the configuration file. A malicious user may craft a special payload that may lead to a command injection. The impact of a configuration injection may vary. Under some conditions, it may lead to command injection if there is for instance shell code execution from the configuration file values. This vulnerability does not currently have a fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35932", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nJcvi Project\u00bbJcviVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.5cpe:2.3:a:jcvi_project:jcvi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-03  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-05-23  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-12  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-29  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-04-18  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-06  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-07-06  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi/security/advisories/GHSA-x49m-3cw7-gq5q", "ref_desc": "Configuration Injection in tanghaibao/jcvi due to unsanitized user input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tanghaibao/jcvi \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi/blob/cede6c65c8e7603cb266bc3395ac8f915ea9eac7/jcvi/apps/base.py#LL2227C1-L2228C41", "ref_desc": "jcvi/jcvi/apps/base.py at cede6c65c8e7603cb266bc3395ac8f915ea9eac7 \u00b7 tanghaibao/jcvi \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
