{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34467", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.5-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1, the mail obfuscation configuration was not fully taken into account. While the mail displayed to the end user was obfuscated, the rest response was also containing the mail unobfuscated and users were able to filter and sort on the unobfuscated, allowing them to infer the mail content. The consequence was the possibility to retrieve the email addresses of all users even when obfuscated. This has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34467", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.10andbefore (<) 14.10.4cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 3.5.1andbefore (<) 14.4.8cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:3.5UpdateMilestone1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:3.5:milestone1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-03  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-25  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-29  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-23  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-01  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-402 Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/402/Transmission-of-Private-Resources-into-a-New-Sphere-Resour.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20333", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20333] Retrieve email addresses of all users - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-7vr7-cghh-ch63", "ref_desc": "Retrieve email addresses of all users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/71f889db9962df2d385f4298e29cfbc9050b828a#diff-5a739e5865b1f1ad9d79b724791be51b0095a0170cc078911c940478b13b949a", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-20333: Improved filtering and sorting of emails in Livetable \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@71f889d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
