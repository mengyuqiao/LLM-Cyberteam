{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34231", "Description": "gosnowflake is th Snowflake Golang driver. Prior to version 1.6.19, a command injection vulnerability exists in the Snowflake Golang driver via single sign-on (SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. A patch is available in version 1.6.19.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34231", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSnowflake\u00bbGosnowflake\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.6.19cpe:2.3:a:snowflake:gosnowflake:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.49%  0.48%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-11-05  0.49%  0.49%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-10  0.67%  0.49%  -0.18 \n 4  2024-06-14  0.51%  0.67%  +0.16 \n 5  2024-05-08  0.38%  0.51%  +0.14 \n 6  2023-11-19  0.37%  0.38%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-08-21  0.27%  0.37%  +0.10 \n 8  2023-07-18  0.25%  0.27%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-07-15  0.31%  0.25%  -0.06 \n 10  2023-07-08  0.25%  0.31%  +0.06 \n 11  2023-06-21  0.07%  0.25%  +0.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/pull/757", "ref_desc": "SNOW-761744 Added URL Validator and URL Encoder by sfc-gh-hchaturvedi \u00b7 Pull Request #757 \u00b7 snowflakedb/gosnowflake \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/commit/e11a2a555f1b9f7adc1f01fb7b5e7f38fbbb2a1c", "ref_desc": "SNOW-761744 Added URL Validator and URL Encoder (#757) \u00b7 snowflakedb/gosnowflake@e11a2a5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/security/advisories/GHSA-fwv2-65wh-2w8c", "ref_desc": "Snowflake Golang Driver Security Advisory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 snowflakedb/gosnowflake \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
