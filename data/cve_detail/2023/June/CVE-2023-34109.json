{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34109", "Description": "zxcvbn-ts is an open source password strength estimator written in typescript. This vulnerability affects users running on the nodeJS platform which are using the second argument of the zxcvbn function. It can result in an unbounded resource consumption as the user inputs array is extended with every function call. Browsers are impacted, too but a single user need to do a lot of input changes so that it affects the browser, while the node process gets the inputs of every user of a platform and can be killed that way. This problem has been patched in version 3.0.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should stop using the second argument of the zxcvbn function and use the zxcvbnOptions.setOptions function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34109", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZxcvbn-ts Project\u00bbZxcvbn-ts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.0.2cpe:2.3:a:zxcvbn-ts_project:zxcvbn-ts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-13  0.07%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-05-07  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn/security/advisories/GHSA-38hx-x5hq-5fg4", "ref_desc": "UserInputs dictionary results in Unbounded resource consumption in nodeJS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn/commit/3f9bed21b5d01f6f6863476822ca857355fba22f", "ref_desc": "fix(user-inputs): resolve memory leak with user inputs on the fly \u00b7 zxcvbn-ts/zxcvbn@3f9bed2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
