{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26436", "Description": "Attackers with access to the \"documentconverterws\" API were able to inject serialized Java objects, that were not properly checked during deserialization. Access to this API endpoint is restricted to local networks by default. Arbitrary code could be injected that is being executed when processing the request. A check has been introduced to restrict processing of legal and expected classes for this API. We now log a warning in case there are attempts to inject illegal classes. No publicly available exploits are known.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26436", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpen-xchange\u00bbOpen-xchange Appsuite BackendVersions  before (<) 7.10.6cpe:2.3:a:open-xchange:open-xchange_appsuite_backend:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpen-xchange\u00bbOpen-xchange Appsuite Backend\u00bbVersion:7.10.6cpe:2.3:a:open-xchange:open-xchange_appsuite_backend:7.10.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpen-xchange\u00bbOpen-xchange Appsuite Backend\u00bbVersion:7.10.6UpdateRevision 39cpe:2.3:a:open-xchange:open-xchange_appsuite_backend:7.10.6:revision_39:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-07-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jun/8", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: OXAS-ADV-2023-0002: OX App Suite Security AdvisoryMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HcnEK3tVd7zKo3HjtZNKmTQP1PU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/security/advisories/csaf/2023/oxas-adv-2023-0002.json", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/iQRTv2mcn-zvbF1zd9umKQb_UvM.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173083/OX-App-Suite-SSRF-Resource-Consumption-Command-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "OX App Suite SSRF / Resource Consumption / Command Injection \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/khATGHzLQyDrrDvGgUx-K5qUYIc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://software.open-xchange.com/products/appsuite/doc/Release_Notes_for_Patch_Release_6219_7.10.6_2023-03-20.pdf", "ref_desc": "Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/M9WgIOPLHfw103pbXUryWKpn2jY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://documentation.open-xchange.com/security/advisories/csaf/oxas-adv-2023-0002.json", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/w9M6648YEy8jZWmHuMEWZKo9h2I.html"}]}
