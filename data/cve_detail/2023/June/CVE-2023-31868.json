{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31868", "Description": "Sage X3 version 12.14.0.50-0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS). Some parts of the Web application are dynamically built using user's inputs. Yet, those inputs are not verified nor filtered by the application, so they mathed the expected format. Therefore, when HTML/JavaScript code is injected into those fields, this code will be saved by the application and executed by the web browser of the user viewing the web page. Several injection points have been identified on the application. The major one requires the user to be authenticated with a common account, he can then target an Administrator. All others endpoints need the malicious user to be authenticated as an Administrator. Therefore, the impact is diminished.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31868", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSage\u00bbX3\u00bbVersion:12.14.0.50-0cpe:2.3:a:sage:x3:12.14.0.50-0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-28  0.06%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-05-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-06-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Digitemis/Advisory/blob/main/CVE-2023-31868.txt", "ref_desc": "Advisory/CVE-2023-31868.txt at main \u00b7 Digitemis/Advisory \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://sage.com", "ref_desc": "Sage UK - Software & Solutions for Every BusinessProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NDQPuDQLH2SEXGOTy3L8_y_5boY.html"}]}
