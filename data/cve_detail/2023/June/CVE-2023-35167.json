{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35167", "Description": "Remult is a CRUD framework for full-stack TypeScript. If you used the apiPrefilter option of the `@Entity` decorator, by setting it to a function that returns a filter that prevents unauthorized access to data, an attacker who knows the `id` of an entity instance is not authorized to access, can gain read, update and delete access to it. The issue is fixed in version 0.20.6. As a workaround, set the `apiPrefilter` option to a filter object instead of a function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35167", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRemult\u00bbRemult\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.20.6cpe:2.3:a:remult:remult:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-29  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-05-23  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-07-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/remult/remult/commit/6892ae97134126d8710ef7302bb2fc37730994c5", "ref_desc": "fixed api prefilter \u00b7 remult/remult@6892ae9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/remult/remult/security/advisories/GHSA-7hh3-3x64-v2g9", "ref_desc": "When setting EntityOptions.apiPrefilter to a function, the filter is not applied to API requests for a resource by Id \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 remult/remult \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/remult/remult/releases/tag/v0.20.6", "ref_desc": "Release v0.20.6 \u00b7 remult/remult \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
