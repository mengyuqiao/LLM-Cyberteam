{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32690", "Description": "libspdm is a sample implementation that follows the DMTF SPDM specifications. Prior to versions 2.3.3 and 3.0, following a successful CAPABILITIES response, a libspdm Requester stores the Responder's CTExponent into its context without validation. If the Requester sends a request message that requires a cryptography operation by the Responder, such as CHALLENGE, libspdm will calculate the timeout value using the Responder's unvalidated CTExponent.\n\nA patch is available in version 2.3.3. A workaround is also available. After completion of VCA, the Requester can check the value of the Responder's CTExponent. If it greater than or equal to 64, then the Requester can stop communication with the Responder.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32690", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nDmtf\u00bbLibspdmVersions  before (<) 2.3.3cpe:2.3:a:dmtf:libspdm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-03  0.18%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-07  0.10%  0.18%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-06-10  0.05%  0.10%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DMTF/libspdm/issues/2068", "ref_desc": "Responder can Invoke Undefined Behavior in libspdm Requester \u00b7 Issue #2068 \u00b7 DMTF/libspdm \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DMTF/libspdm/pull/2069", "ref_desc": "Prevent undefined behavior by steven-bellock \u00b7 Pull Request #2069 \u00b7 DMTF/libspdm \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DMTF/libspdm/security/advisories/GHSA-56h8-4gv5-jf2c", "ref_desc": "DMTF-2023-0002: Responder can Invoke Undefined Behavior in libspdm Requester \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DMTF/libspdm \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
