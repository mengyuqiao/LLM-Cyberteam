{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29725", "Description": "The BT21 x BTS Wallpaper app 12 for Android allows unauthorized applications to actively request permission to insert data into the database that records information about a user's personal preferences and will be loaded into memory to be read and used when the application is opened. By injecting data, the attacker can force the application to load malicious image URLs and display them in the UI. As the amount of data increases, it will eventually cause the application to trigger an OOM error and crash, resulting in a persistent denial of service attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29725", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nBt21 X Bts Wallpaper Project\u00bbBt21 X Bts Wallpaper\u00bbVersion:12ForAndroidcpe:2.3:a:bt21_x_bts_wallpaper_project:bt21_x_bts_wallpaper:12:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-04  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://bungaakpstudio007.com", "ref_desc": "Broken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://apkpure.com/cn/bt21-x-bts-wallpaper-hd-4k/com.bungaakp007.bt21wallpaperoffline130920/download/12-APK", "ref_desc": "\u4e0b\u8f7dBT21 x BTS Wallpaper HD 4K 12.0\u5b89\u5353\u7248\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u672cAPKProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ScBIrn2ZDcnR1mxVZvxO8qXtaXg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/LianKee/SO-CVEs/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2023-29725/CVE%20detail.md", "ref_desc": "SO-CVEs/CVE detail.md at main \u00b7 LianKee/SO-CVEs \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
