{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33566", "Description": "An unauthorized node injection vulnerability has been identified in ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy versions where ROS_VERSION is 2 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION is 3. This vulnerability could allow a malicious user to inject malicious ROS2 nodes into the system remotely. Once injected, these nodes could disrupt the normal operations of the system or cause other potentially harmful behavior. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33566", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenrobotics\u00bbRobot Operating System\u00bbVersion:2UpdateFoxycpe:2.3:a:openrobotics:robot_operating_system:2:foxy:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 9 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-27  0.06%  0.04%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-05-02  0.09%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-07-07  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jXt4A209jgtGWXeoSEyBUKOOMxg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/16yashpatel/CVE-2023-33566", "ref_desc": "GitHub - 16yashpatel/CVE-2023-33566: Unauthorized Node Injection Vulnerability in ROS2 Foxy FitzroyThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/5", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Mgg78h5_k6LWdnxzrs9Ow5VyHKA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ObdzCuH3Co0iyLfzlZUUdbs8JH0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/23/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/s50QOweWZO8DnZiKflxrVT-5Jes.html"}]}
