{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-52139", "Description": "Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. Third-party applications may be able to access some endpoints or Websocket APIs that are incorrectly specified as [kind](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/406b4bdbe79b5b0b68fcdcb3c4b6e419460a0258/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints.ts#L811) or [secure](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/406b4bdbe79b5b0b68fcdcb3c4b6e419460a0258/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints.ts#L805) without the user's permission and perform operations such as reading or adding non-public content. As a result, if the user who authenticated the application is an administrator, confidential information such as object storage secret keys and SMTP server passwords will be leaked, and general users can also create invitation codes without permission and leak non-public user information. This is patched in version [2023.12.1](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/c96bc36fedc804dc840ea791a9355d7df0748e64).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52139", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMisskey\u00bbMisskeyVersions  before (<) 2023.12.1cpe:2.3:a:misskey:misskey:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/c96bc36fedc804dc840ea791a9355d7df0748e64", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7pxq-6xx9-xpgm \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey@c96bc36 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-7pxq-6xx9-xpgm", "ref_desc": "Improper authorization when accessing with third-party application \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
