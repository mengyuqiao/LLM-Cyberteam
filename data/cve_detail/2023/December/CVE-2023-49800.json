{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49800", "Description": "`nuxt-api-party` is an open source module to proxy API requests. The library allows the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`. There is no filter on which options are available. We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow. fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request body. A malicious user can construct a URL known  to not fetch successfully, then set the retry attempts to a high value, this will cause a stack overflow as ofetch error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of service. This issue has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit ofetch options.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49800", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nJohannschopplich\u00bbNuxt Api Party\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.21.3cpe:2.3:a:johannschopplich:nuxt_api_party:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-14  0.06%  0.05%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party/security/advisories/GHSA-q6hx-3m4p-749h", "ref_desc": "DOS by abusing `fetchOptions.retry`. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
