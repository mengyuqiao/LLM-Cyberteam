{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47265", "Description": "Apache Airflow, versions 2.6.0 through 2.7.3 has a stored XSS vulnerability that allows a DAG author to add an unbounded and not-sanitized javascript in the parameter description field of the DAG.\u00a0This Javascript can be executed on the client side of any of the user who looks at the tasks in the browser sandbox. While this issue does not allow to exit the browser sandbox or manipulation of the server-side data - more than the DAG author already has, it allows to modify what the user looking at the DAG details sees in the browser - which opens up all kinds of possibilities of misleading other users.\n\nUsers of Apache Airflow are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47265", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbAirflowVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.7.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:airflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-06-27  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 3  2024-01-23  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-12-29  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/21/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-47265: Apache Airflow: DAG Params alllow to embed unchecked JavascriptMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/128f3zl375vb1qv93k82zhnwkpl233pr", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-47265: Apache Airflow: DAG Params alllow to embed unchecked Javascript-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35460", "ref_desc": "Make raw HTML descriptions configurable by jscheffl \u00b7 Pull Request #35460 \u00b7 apache/airflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
