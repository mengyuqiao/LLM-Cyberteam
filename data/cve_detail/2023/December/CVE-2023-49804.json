{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49804", "Description": "Uptime Kuma is an easy-to-use self-hosted monitoring tool. Prior to version 1.23.9, when a user changes their login password in Uptime Kuma, a previously logged-in user retains access without being logged out. This behavior persists consistently, even after system restarts or browser restarts. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to user accounts, compromising the security of sensitive information. The same vulnerability was partially fixed in  CVE-2023-44400, but logging existing users out of their accounts was forgotten. To mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability, the maintainers made the server emit a `refresh` event (clients handle this by reloading) and then disconnecting all clients except the one initiating the password change. It is recommended to update Uptime Kuma to version 1.23.9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49804", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nUptime.kuma\u00bbUptime KumaVersions  before (<) 1.23.9cpe:2.3:a:uptime.kuma:uptime_kuma:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDockge.kuma\u00bbDockgeVersions  before (<) 1.3.3cpe:2.3:a:dockge.kuma:dockge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-15  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g", "ref_desc": "Persistentent User Sessions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lajEWsWhciSsHNNlRNe90b_nnNk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/commit/482049c72b3a650c7bc5c26c2f4d57a21c0e0aa0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q3 \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma@482049c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q3", "ref_desc": "Changing Password does not close all logged in socket connections immediately \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 louislam/uptime-kuma \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
