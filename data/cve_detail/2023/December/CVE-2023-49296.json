{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49296", "Description": "The Arduino Create Agent allows users to use the Arduino Create applications to upload code to any USB connected Arduino board directly from the browser. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.3.6 affects the endpoint `/certificate.crt` and the way the web interface of the ArduinoCreateAgent handles custom error messages. An attacker that is able to persuade a victim into clicking on a malicious link can perform a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack on the web interface of the create agent, which would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary browser client side code. Version 1.3.6 contains a fix for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49296", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nArduino\u00bbCreate Agent\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.3.6cpe:2.3:a:arduino:create_agent:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/commit/9a0e582bb8a1ff8e70d202943ddef8625ccefcc8", "ref_desc": "Remove `/certificate.crt` endpoint (#858) \u00b7 arduino/arduino-create-agent@9a0e582 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-j5hc-wx84-844h", "ref_desc": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 arduino/arduino-create-agent \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
