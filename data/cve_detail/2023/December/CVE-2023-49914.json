{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49914", "Description": "InteraXon Muse 2 devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect Muse App report of an outstanding, calm meditation state) via a 480 MHz RF carrier that is modulated by a \"false\" brain wave, aka a Brain-Hack attack. For example, the Muse App does not display the reception of a strong RF carrier, and alert the user that a report may be misleading if this carrier has been modulated by a low-frequency signal.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49914", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nChoosemuse\u00bbMuse 2 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:choosemuse:muse_2_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Choosemuse\u00bbMuse 2\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-08  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8hu27apy8A4C&citation_for_view=8hu27apy8A4C:Se3iqnhoufwC", "ref_desc": "Sorry...Technical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3605758.3623497", "ref_desc": "Brain-Hack: Remotely Injecting False Brain-Waves with RF to Take Control of a Brain-Computer Interface | Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on CPS&IoT Security and PrivacyTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
