{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-50715", "Description": "Home Assistant is open source home automation software. Prior to version 2023.12.3, the login page discloses all active user accounts to any unauthenticated browsing request originating on the Local Area Network. Version 2023.12.3 contains a patch for this issue.\n\nWhen starting the Home Assistant 2023.12 release, the login page returns all currently active user accounts to browsing requests from the Local Area Network. Tests showed that this occurs when the request is not authenticated and the request originated locally, meaning on the Home Assistant host local subnet or any other private subnet. The rationale behind this is to make the login more user-friendly and an experience better aligned with other applications that have multiple user-profiles.\n\nHowever, as a result, all accounts are displayed regardless of them having logged in or not and for any device that navigates to the server. This disclosure is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for requests originating from a LAN address. But note that this applies to the local subnet where Home Assistant resides and to any private subnet that can reach it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50715", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nHome-assistant\u00bbHome-assistantVersions  before (<) 2023.12.3cpe:2.3:a:home-assistant:home-assistant:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-03  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-12-28  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-jqpc-rc7g-vf83", "ref_desc": "User accounts disclosed to unauthenticated actors on the LAN \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 home-assistant/core \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/home-assistant/core/commit/dbfc5ea8f96bde6cd165892f5a6a6f9a65731c76", "ref_desc": "Disable user profiles on login screen (#105749) \u00b7 home-assistant/core@dbfc5ea \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
