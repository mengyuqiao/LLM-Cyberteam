{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48702", "Description": "Jellyfin is a system for managing and streaming media. Prior to version 10.8.13, the `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` endpoint executes an arbitrary file using `ProcessStartInfo` via the `ValidateVersion` function. A malicious administrator can setup a network share and supply a UNC path to `/System/MediaEncoder/Path` which points to an executable on the network share, causing Jellyfin server to run the executable in the local context. The endpoint was removed in version 10.8.13.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48702", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJellyfin\u00bbJellyfinVersions  before (<) 10.8.13cpe:2.3:a:jellyfin:jellyfin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-19  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-19  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-028_jellyfin/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-028: Remote Code Execution in jellyfin - CVE-2023-48702 | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/security/advisories/GHSA-rr9h-w522-cvmr", "ref_desc": "Possible Remote Code Execution via custom FFmpeg binary \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jellyfin/jellyfin \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/commit/83d2c69516471e2db72d9273c6a04247d0f37c86", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-rr9h-w522-cvmr \u00b7 jellyfin/jellyfin@83d2c69 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
