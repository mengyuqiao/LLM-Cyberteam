{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49279", "Description": "Umbraco is an ASP.NET content management system (CMS). Starting in version 7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0, a user with access to the backoffice can upload SVG files that include scripts. If the user can trick another user to load the media directly in a browser, the scripts can be executed. Versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0 contain a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Implement the server side file validation or serve all media from an different host (e.g cdn) than where Umbraco is hosted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49279", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco CmsVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.18.9cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco CmsVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andbefore (<) 12.2.0cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco CmsVersions  from including (>=) 11.0.0andbefore (<) 11.5.0cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco CmsVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.7.0cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nUmbraco\u00bbUmbraco CmsVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.15.11cpe:2.3:a:umbraco:umbraco_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-16  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/security/serverside-file-validation", "ref_desc": "Server-side file validation - Umbraco CMSProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-6xmx-85x3-4cv2", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via SVG File Upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 umbraco/Umbraco-CMS \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
