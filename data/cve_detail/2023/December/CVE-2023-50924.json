{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-50924", "Description": "Englesystem is a shift planning system for chaos events. Engelsystem prior to v3.4.1 performed insufficient validation of user supplied data for the DECT number, mobile number, and work-log comment fields. The values of those fields would be displayed in corresponding log overviews, allowing the injection and execution of Javascript code in another user's context. This vulnerability enables an authenticated user to inject Javascript into other user's sessions. The injected JS will be executed during normal usage of the system when viewing, e.g., overview pages. This issue has been fixed in version 3.4.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50924", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nEngelsystem\u00bbEngelsystemVersions  before (<) 3.4.1cpe:2.3:a:engelsystem:engelsystem:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/engelsystem/engelsystem/security/advisories/GHSA-p5ch-rrpm-wvhm", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in Overview and Output fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 engelsystem/engelsystem \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/engelsystem/engelsystem/commit/efda1ffc1ce59f02a7d237d9087adea26e73ec5f", "ref_desc": "Escape text outputs in includes \u00b7 engelsystem/engelsystem@efda1ff \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
