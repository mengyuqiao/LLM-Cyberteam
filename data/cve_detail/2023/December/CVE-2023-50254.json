This is a file overwrite vulnerability. Remote code execution (RCE) can be achieved by overwriting files like .bash_rc, .bash_login, etc. RCE will be triggered when the user opens the terminal. Version 6.0.7 contains a patch for the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50254", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDeepin\u00bbDeepin ReaderVersions  before (<) 6.0.7cpe:2.3:a:deepin:deepin_reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.58% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.50%  0.58%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-08-09  0.50%  0.50%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-17  0.59%  0.50%  -0.10 \n 4  2024-05-10  0.47%  0.59%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-01-04  0.07%  0.47%  +0.40 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-27 Path Traversal: 'dir/../../filename'", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/27/Path-Traversal-dir-..-..-filename-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-reader/commit/4db7a079fb7bd77257b1b9208a7ab26aade8fe04", "ref_desc": "fix: change log 6.0.7 \u00b7 linuxdeepin/deepin-reader@4db7a07 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/linuxdeepin/developer-center/security/advisories/GHSA-q9jr-726g-9495", "ref_desc": "Deepin Reader RCE vulnerability due to a design flaw \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 linuxdeepin/developer-center \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-reader/commit/c192fd20a2fe4003e0581c3164489a89e06420c6", "ref_desc": "fix: deal with docx document format \u00b7 linuxdeepin/deepin-reader@c192fd2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
