{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47118", "Description": "ClickHouse\u00ae is an open-source column-oriented database management system that allows generating analytical data reports in real-time. A heap buffer overflow issue was discovered in ClickHouse server. An attacker could send a specially crafted payload to the native interface exposed by default on port 9000/tcp, triggering a bug in the decompression logic of T64 codec that crashes the ClickHouse server process. This attack does not require authentication. Note that this exploit can also be triggered via HTTP protocol, however, the attacker will need a valid credential as the HTTP authentication take places first. This issue has been fixed in version 23.10.2.13-stable, 23.9.4.11-stable, 23.8.6.16-lts and 23.3.16.7-lts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47118", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nClickhouse\u00bbClickhouse\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 23.8andbefore (<) 23.8.6.16cpe:2.3:a:clickhouse:clickhouse:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nClickhouse\u00bbClickhouseVersions  from including (>=) 23.10andbefore (<) 23.10.2.13cpe:2.3:a:clickhouse:clickhouse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nClickhouse\u00bbClickhouse\u00bb     LTSEditionVersions  from including (>=) 23.3andbefore (<) 23.3.16.7cpe:2.3:a:clickhouse:clickhouse:*:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*Matching versions\nClickhouse\u00bbClickhouseVersions  from including (>=) 23.9andbefore (<) 23.9.4.11cpe:2.3:a:clickhouse:clickhouse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nClickhouse\u00bbClickhouse CloudVersions  before (<) 23.9.2.47475cpe:2.3:a:clickhouse:clickhouse_cloud:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-05  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/security/advisories/GHSA-g22g-p6q2-x39v", "ref_desc": "Heap buffer overflow in T64 codec decompression \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ClickHouse/ClickHouse \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
