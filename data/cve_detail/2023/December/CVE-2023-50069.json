{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-50069", "Description": "WireMock with GUI versions 3.2.0.0 through 3.0.4.0 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (SXSS) through the recording feature. An attacker can host a malicious payload and perform a test mapping pointing to the attacker's file, and the result will render on the Matched page in the Body area, resulting in the execution of the payload. This occurs because the response body is not validated or sanitized.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50069", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nWiremock\u00bbWiremockVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.4andup to, including, (<=) 3.2.0cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:wiremock:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/holomekc/wiremock/issues/51", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerability - Stored Cross Site Scripting \u00b7 Issue #51 \u00b7 holomekc/wiremock \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
