{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46675", "Description": "An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error or in the event where debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Elastic has released Kibana 8.11.2 which resolves this issue. The messages recorded in the log may contain Account credentials for the kibana_system user, API Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users, Elastic Security package policy objects which can contain private keys, bearer token, and sessions of 3rd-party integrations and finally Authorization headers, client secrets, local file paths, and stack traces. The issue may occur in any Kibana instance running an affected version that could potentially receive an unexpected error when communicating to Elasticsearch causing it to include sensitive data into Kibana error logs. It could also occur under specific circumstances when debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Note: It was found that the fix for ESA-2023-25 in Kibana 8.11.1 for a similar issue was incomplete.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46675", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbKibanaVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.11.2cpe:2.3:a:elastic:kibana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nElastic\u00bbKibanaVersions  from including (>=) 7.13.0andbefore (<) 7.17.16cpe:2.3:a:elastic:kibana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-19  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/kibana-8-11-2-7-17-16-security-update-esa-2023-27/349182/2", "ref_desc": "Kibana 8.11.2, 7.17.16 Security Update (ESA-2023-27) - Announcements / Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
