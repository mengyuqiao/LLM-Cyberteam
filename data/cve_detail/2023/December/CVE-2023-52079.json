{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-52079", "Description": "msgpackr is a fast MessagePack NodeJS/JavaScript implementation. Prior to 1.10.1, when decoding user supplied MessagePack messages, users can trigger stuck threads by crafting messages that keep the decoder stuck in a loop. The fix is available in v1.10.1.  \nExploits seem to require structured cloning, replacing the 0x70 extension with your own (that throws an error or does something other than recursive referencing) should mitigate the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52079", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKriszyp\u00bbMsgpackr\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.10.1cpe:2.3:a:kriszyp:msgpackr:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-05  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kriszyp/msgpackr/commit/18f44f8800e2261341cdf489d1ba1e35a0133602", "ref_desc": "Ensure that string conversion doesn't recursively join or execute code \u00b7 kriszyp/msgpackr@18f44f8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kriszyp/msgpackr/security/advisories/GHSA-7hpj-7hhx-2fgx", "ref_desc": "Conversion of property names to strings can trigger infinite recursion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kriszyp/msgpackr \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
