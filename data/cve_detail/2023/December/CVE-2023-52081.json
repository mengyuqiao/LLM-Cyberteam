{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-52081", "Description": "ffcss is a CLI interface to apply and configure Firefox CSS themes. Prior to 0.2.0, the function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However, due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD, it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. The `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (\ufe4d), which would result in the omitted U+005F (_), for instance. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively, while ignoring dashes, underscores and dots), so the actual security impact is classified as low. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.2.0. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52081", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEwen-lbh\u00bbFirefox Css\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 0.2.0cpe:2.3:a:ewen-lbh:firefox_css:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-176 Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/176/Improper-Handling-of-Unicode-Encoding.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ewen-lbh/ffcss/security/advisories/GHSA-wpmx-564x-h2mh", "ref_desc": "Late-Unicode normalization vulnerability in ewen-lbh/ffcss \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ewen-lbh/ffcss \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ewen-lbh/ffcss/commit/f9c491874b858a32fcae15045f169fd7d02f90dc", "ref_desc": "Perform the Unicode Normalization first. \u00b7 ewen-lbh/ffcss@f9c4918 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
