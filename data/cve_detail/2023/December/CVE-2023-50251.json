{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-50251", "Description": "php-svg-lib is an SVG file parsing / rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.1, when parsing the attributes passed to a `use` tag inside an svg document, an attacker can cause the system to go to an infinite recursion. Depending on the system configuration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the server itself. An attacker sending multiple request to a system to render the above payload can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point that the system is unable to handle incoming request. Version 0.5.1 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50251", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDompdf\u00bbPhp-svg-libVersions  before (<) 0.5.1cpe:2.3:a:dompdf:php-svg-lib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-16  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/674/Uncontrolled-Recursion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/commit/88163cbe562d9b391b3a352e54d9c89d02d77ee0", "ref_desc": "Prevent circular reference in use elements \u00b7 dompdf/php-svg-lib@88163cb \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/security/advisories/GHSA-ff5x-7qg5-vwf2", "ref_desc": "Possible DoS caused by infinite recursion when parsing SVG document \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dompdf/php-svg-lib \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
