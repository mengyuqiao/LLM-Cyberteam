{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-50250", "Description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. A reflection cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in version 1.2.25. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of other users. The vulnerability is found in `templates_import.php.` When uploading an xml template file, if the XML file does not pass the check, the server will give a JavaScript pop-up prompt, which contains unfiltered xml template file name, resulting in XSS. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions on behalf of other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized changes to settings. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50250", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCacti\u00bbCacti\u00bbVersion:1.2.25cpe:2.3:a:cacti:cacti:1.2.25:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: cacti-spine-1.2.27-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1jykueqxgsrc5w7w2xLB41hl78Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-xwqc-7jc4-xm73", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability when importing a template file \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Cacti/cacti \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jnemRv25QVzkjlP-Qtjjo49Y7AY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/5f6f65c215d663a775950b2d9db35edbaf07d680/templates_import.php", "ref_desc": "cacti/templates_import.php at 5f6f65c215d663a775950b2d9db35edbaf07d680 \u00b7 Cacti/cacti \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
