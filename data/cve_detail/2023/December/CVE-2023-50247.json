{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-50247", "Description": "h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The QUIC stack (quicly), as used by H2O up to commit 43f86e5 (in version 2.3.0-beta and prior), is susceptible to a state exhaustion attack. When H2O is serving HTTP/3, a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to progressively increase the memory retained by the QUIC stack. This can eventually cause H2O to abort due to memory exhaustion. The vulnerability has been resolved in commit d67e81d03be12a9d53dc8271af6530f40164cd35. HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 are not affected by this vulnerability as they do not use QUIC. Administrators looking to mitigate this issue without upgrading can disable HTTP/3 support.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50247", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDena\u00bbH2OVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.6cpe:2.3:a:dena:h2o:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDena\u00bbH2O\u00bbVersion:2.3.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:dena:h2o:2.3.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDena\u00bbH2O\u00bbVersion:2.3.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:dena:h2o:2.3.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-20  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/h2o/h2o/security/advisories/GHSA-2ch5-p59c-7mv6", "ref_desc": "QUIC state exhaustion DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 h2o/h2o \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/d67e81d03be12a9d53dc8271af6530f40164cd35", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2ch5-p59c-7mv6 \u00b7 h2o/h2o@d67e81d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
