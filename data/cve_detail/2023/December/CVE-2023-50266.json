{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-50266", "Description": "Bazarr manages and downloads subtitles. In version 1.2.4, the proxy method in bazarr/bazarr/app/ui.py does not validate the user-controlled protocol and url variables and passes them to requests.get() without any sanitization, which leads to a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF). This issue allows for crafting GET requests to internal and external resources on behalf of the server. 1.3.1 contains a partial fix, which limits the vulnerability to HTTP/HTTPS protocols.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50266", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nBazarr\u00bbBazarr\u00bbVersion:1.2.4cpe:2.3:a:bazarr:bazarr:1.2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-20  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-192_GHSL-2023-194_bazarr/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-192_GHSL-2023-194: Several vulnerabilities in bazarr - CVE-2023-50264, CVE-2023-50265, CVE-2023-50266 | GitHub Security LabPatch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/90c0hiDzckA2c8URumrsMroN35g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/releases/tag/v1.3.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.3.1 \u00b7 morpheus65535/bazarr \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MMqqGM-zmEYLK-K_GdMTD6EQH5g.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/commit/17add7fbb3ae1919a40d505470d499d46df9ae6b", "ref_desc": "Fixed some code to prevent arbitrary file read and blind SSRF. \u00b7 morpheus65535/bazarr@17add7f \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wGX_Z0w45YE5HnvfhGwfgzxgghE.html"}]}
