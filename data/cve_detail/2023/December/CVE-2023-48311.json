{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48311", "Description": "dockerspawner is a tool to spawn JupyterHub single user servers in Docker containers. Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch _any_ pullable docker image, instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended. This issue has been addressed in commit `3ba4b665b` which has been included in dockerspawner release version 13. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should explicitly set `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default behavior.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48311", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nJupyter\u00bbDockerspawnerVersions  from including (>=) 0.11.0andbefore (<) 13.0cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:dockerspawner:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/commit/3ba4b665b6ca6027ea7a032d7ca3eab977574626", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hfgr-h3vc-p6c2 \u00b7 jupyterhub/dockerspawner@3ba4b66 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/security/advisories/GHSA-hfgr-h3vc-p6c2", "ref_desc": "Any image allowed by default \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jupyterhub/dockerspawner \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
