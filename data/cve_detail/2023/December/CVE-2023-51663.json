{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-51663", "Description": "Hail is an open-source, general-purpose, Python-based data analysis tool with additional data types and methods for working with genomic data. Hail relies on OpenID Connect (OIDC) email addresses from ID tokens to verify the validity of a user's domain, but because users have the ability to change their email address, they could create accounts and use resources in clusters that they should not have access to. For example, a user could create a Microsoft or Google account and then change their email to `test@example.org`. This account can then be used to create a Hail Batch account in Hail Batch clusters whose organization domain is `example.org`. The attacker is not able to access private data or impersonate another user, but they would have the ability to run jobs if Hail Batch billing projects are enabled and create Azure Tenants if they have Azure Active Directory Administrator access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51663", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHail\u00bbHail\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 0.2.127cpe:2.3:a:hail:hail:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-289 Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/289/Authentication-Bypass-by-Alternate-Name.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hail-is/hail/security/advisories/GHSA-487p-qx68-5vjw", "ref_desc": "Hail Batch relies on OIDC email claims to verify the validity of a user's domain. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hail-is/hail \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
