{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49290", "Description": "lestrrat-go/jwx is a Go module implementing various JWx (JWA/JWE/JWK/JWS/JWT, otherwise known as JOSE) technologies. A p2c parameter set too high in JWE's algorithm PBES2-* could lead to a denial of service. The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2 require a JOSE Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its primary purpose is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function, making password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource- intensive. Therefore, if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause a lot of computational consumption, resulting in a denial of service. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `64f2a229b` which has been included in release version 1.2.27 and 2.0.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49290", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLestrrat-go\u00bbJWXVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.18cpe:2.3:a:lestrrat-go:jwx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLestrrat-go\u00bbJWXVersions  before (<) 1.2.27cpe:2.3:a:lestrrat-go:jwx:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/64f2a229b8e18605f47361d292b526bdc4aee01c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7f9x-gw85-8grf \u00b7 lestrrat-go/jwx@64f2a22 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/security/advisories/GHSA-7f9x-gw85-8grf", "ref_desc": "Malicious parameters in JWE can cause a DOS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 lestrrat-go/jwx \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
