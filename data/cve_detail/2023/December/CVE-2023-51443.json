{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-51443", "Description": "FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.11, when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup, FreeSWITCH is susceptible to Denial of Service due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the DTLS protocol. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the attack. If an attacker manages to send a ClientHello DTLS message with an invalid CipherSuite (such as `TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`) to the port on the FreeSWITCH server that is expecting packets from the caller, a DTLS error is generated. This results in the media session being torn down, which is followed by teardown at signaling (SIP) level too. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable FreeSWITCH servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. To address this vulnerability, upgrade FreeSWITCH to 1.10.11 which includes the security fix. The solution implemented is to drop all packets from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51443", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFreeswitch\u00bbFreeswitchVersions  before (<) 1.10.11cpe:2.3:a:freeswitch:freeswitch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-02-02  0.05%  0.12%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-01-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/703/Improper-Check-or-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/security/advisories/GHSA-39gv-hq72-j6m6", "ref_desc": "FreeSWITCH susceptible to Denial of Service via DTLS Hello packets during call initiation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/commit/86cbda90b84ba186e508fbc7bfae469270a97d11", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-39gv-hq72-j6m6 \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch@86cbda9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176393/FreeSWITCH-Denial-Of-Service.html", "ref_desc": "FreeSWITCH Denial Of Service \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
