{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-52137", "Description": "The [`tj-actions/verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files) action allows for command injection in changed filenames, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code and potentially leak secrets. The [`verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files) workflow returns the list of files changed within a workflow execution. This could potentially allow filenames that contain special characters such as `;` which can be used by an attacker to take over the [GitHub Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) if the output value is used in a raw fashion (thus being directly replaced before execution) inside a `run` block. By running custom commands, an attacker may be able to steal secrets such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` if triggered on other events than `pull_request`.\n\nThis has been patched in versions [17](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17) and [17.0.0](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17.0.0) by enabling `safe_output` by default and returning filename paths escaping special characters for bash environments.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52137", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nTj-actions\u00bbVerify-changed-files\u00bbForGithubVersions  before (<) 17.0.0cpe:2.3:a:tj-actions:verify-changed-files:*:*:*:*:*:github:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-04  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-01  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 4  2024-07-24  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/security/advisories/GHSA-ghm2-rq8q-wrhc", "ref_desc": "Potential Actions command injection in output filenames (GHSL-2023-275) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tj-actions/verify-changed-files \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/commit/592e305da041c09a009afa4a43c97d889bed65c3", "ref_desc": "chore: update entrypoint.sh (#357) \u00b7 tj-actions/verify-changed-files@592e305 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/commit/498d3f316f501aa72485060e8c96fde7b2014f12", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-ghm2-rq8q-wrhc \u00b7 tj-actions/verify-changed-files@498d3f3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
