{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49283", "Description": "microsoft-graph-core the Microsoft Graph Library for PHP. The Microsoft Graph Beta PHP SDK published packages which contained test code that enabled the use of the phpInfo() function from any application that could access and execute the file at `vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph-core/tests/GetPhpInfo.php`. The phpInfo function exposes system information. The vulnerability affects the GetPhpInfo.php script of the PHP SDK which contains a call to the phpinfo() function. This vulnerability requires a misconfiguration of the server to be present so it can be exploited. For example, making the PHP application\u2019s /vendor directory web accessible. The combination of the vulnerability and the server misconfiguration would allow an attacker to craft an HTTP request that executes the phpinfo() method. The attacker would then be able to get access to system information like configuration, modules, and environment variables and later on use the compromised secrets to access additional data. This problem has been patched in version 2.0.2. If an immediate deployment with the updated vendor package is not available, you can perform the following temporary workarounds: delete the `vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph-core/tests/GetPhpInfo.php` file, remove access to the /vendor directory, or disable the phpinfo function", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49283", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbGraphVersions  before (<) 2.0.2cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:graph:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-04  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-13  0.05%  0.12%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://owncloud.com/security-advisories/disclosure-of-sensitive-credentials-and-configuration-in-containerized-deployments/", "ref_desc": "Disclosure of sensitive credentials and configuration in containerized deployments - ownCloudThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-iiqdrKCUE9Ng1MTu7daK_sh_Og.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-php/compare/2.0.0...2.0.1", "ref_desc": "Comparing 2.0.0...2.0.1 \u00b7 microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-php \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gMtmfSnx8dEtYMhmYbVpHNMW8Ks.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php/compare/1.109.0...1.109.1", "ref_desc": "Comparing 1.109.0...1.109.1 \u00b7 microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/idJK0A4D7LBqZLUSSXz9pvi3erQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php-core/security/advisories/GHSA-mhhp-c3cm-2r86", "ref_desc": "Test code in published microsoft-graph-core package exposes phpinfo() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php-core \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php-core/compare/2.0.1...2.0.2", "ref_desc": "Comparing 2.0.1...2.0.2 \u00b7 microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php-core \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Z9JDu9RV4U7pl_Ob5EC3UgXE8n4.html"}]}
