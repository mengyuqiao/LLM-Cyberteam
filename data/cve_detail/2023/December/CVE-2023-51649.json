{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-51649", "Description": "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. When submitting a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level `extras.run_job` permission is checked (i.e., does the user have permission to run Jobs in general). Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission to run this specific Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case. A user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton Jobs. Fix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 and 2.1.0", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51649", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetworktocode\u00bbNautobotVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.14andbefore (<) 1.6.8cpe:2.3:a:networktocode:nautobot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetworktocode\u00bbNautobotVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:networktocode:nautobot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4988", "ref_desc": "Job and job-button constraints permissions have not been applied \u00b7 Issue #4988 \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993", "ref_desc": "Fix object permissions enforcement on Job Buttons by glennmatthews \u00b7 Pull Request #4993 \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-vf5m-xrhm-v999", "ref_desc": "Missing object-level permissions enforcement when running Job Buttons \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4995", "ref_desc": "[1.6] Fix object permissions enforcement on Job Buttons by glennmatthews \u00b7 Pull Request #4995 \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
