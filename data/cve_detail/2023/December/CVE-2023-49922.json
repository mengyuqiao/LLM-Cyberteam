{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49922", "Description": "An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby Beats and Elastic Agent would log a raw event in its own logs at the WARN or ERROR level if ingesting that event to Elasticsearch failed with any 4xx HTTP status code except 409 or 429. Depending on the nature of the event that Beats or Elastic Agent attempted to ingest, this could lead to the insertion of sensitive or private information in the Beats or Elastic Agent logs. Elastic has released 8.11.3 and 7.17.16 that prevents this issue by limiting these types of logs to DEBUG level logging, which is disabled by default.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49922", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbElastic BeatsVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.17.16cpe:2.3:a:elastic:elastic_beats:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nElastic\u00bbElastic BeatsVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.11.3cpe:2.3:a:elastic:elastic_beats:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/beats-and-elastic-agent-8-11-3-7-17-16-security-update-esa-2023-30/349180", "ref_desc": "Beats and Elastic Agent 8.11.3 / 7.17.16 Security Update (ESA-2023-30) - Announcements / Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bw4epwajbCK2O4bqAdmbN8rL8BE.html"}]}
