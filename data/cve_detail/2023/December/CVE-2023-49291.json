{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49291", "Description": "tj-actions/branch-names is a Github action to retrieve branch or tag names with support for all events. The `tj-actions/branch-names` GitHub Actions improperly references the `github.event.pull_request.head.ref` and `github.head_ref` context variables within a GitHub Actions `run` step. The head ref variable is the branch name and can be used to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted branch name. As a result an attacker can use this vulnerability to steal secrets from or abuse `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 7.0.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49291", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nTj-actions\u00bbBranch-namesVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.1andbefore (<) 7.0.7cpe:2.3:a:tj-actions:branch-names:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTj-actions\u00bbBranch-namesVersions  before (<) 7.0.0cpe:2.3:a:tj-actions:branch-names:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.19%  0.15%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-09-06  0.50%  0.19%  -0.32 \n 3  2024-08-02  0.68%  0.50%  -0.18 \n 4  2023-12-09  0.05%  0.68%  +0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/726fe9ba5e9da4fcc716223b7994ffd0358af060", "ref_desc": "security: remove vulnerable events from test \u00b7 tj-actions/branch-names@726fe9b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/6c999acf206f5561e19f46301bb310e9e70d8815", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #272 from tj-actions/security/remove-vulnerable-ev\u2026 \u00b7 tj-actions/branch-names@6c999ac \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/security/advisories/GHSA-8v8w-v8xg-79rf", "ref_desc": "Improper Sanitization of Branch Name Leads to Arbitrary Code Injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tj-actions/branch-names \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input", "ref_desc": "Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 2: Untrusted input | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UrXVZFA-32qi7WCmoBNC4OciF08.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/4923d1ca41f928c24f1c1b3af9daaadfb71e6337", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #271 from tj-actions/security/prevent-arbitrary-co\u2026 \u00b7 tj-actions/branch-names@4923d1c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
