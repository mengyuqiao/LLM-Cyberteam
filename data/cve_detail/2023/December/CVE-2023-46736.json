In affected versions there is Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability via the upload image from url api. Users who have access to `the /Attachment/fromImageUrl` endpoint can specify URL to point to an internal host. Even though there is check for content type, it can be bypassed by redirects in some cases. This SSRF can be leveraged to disclose internal information (in some cases), target internal hosts and bypass firewalls. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `c536cee63` which is included in release version 8.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46736", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-04  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/commit/c536cee6375e2088f961af13db7aaa652c983072", "ref_desc": "image upload url check \u00b7 espocrm/espocrm@c536cee \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/", "ref_desc": "A10 Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - OWASP Top 10:2021CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ejGT7boCYYGK9e9u_rzrX9hl6wo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/security/advisories/GHSA-g955-rwxx-jvf6", "ref_desc": "SSRF via /Attachment/fromImageUrl endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 espocrm/espocrm \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
