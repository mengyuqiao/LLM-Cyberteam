{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46671", "Description": "An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error. Elastic has released Kibana 8.11.1 which resolves this issue. The error message recorded in the log may contain account credentials for the kibana_system user, API Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users. The issue occurs infrequently, only if an error is returned from an Elasticsearch cluster, in cases where there is user interaction and an unhealthy cluster (for example, when returning circuit breaker or no shard exceptions).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46671", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbKibanaVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.11.1cpe:2.3:a:elastic:kibana:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-19  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/8-11-1-7-17-15-security-update-esa-2023-25/347149", "ref_desc": "Kibana 8.11.1 Security Update (ESA-2023-25) - Announcements / Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
