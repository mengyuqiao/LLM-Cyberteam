{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49088", "Description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. The fix applied for CVE-2023-39515 in version 1.2.25 is incomplete as it enables an adversary to have a victim browser execute malicious code when a victim user hovers their mouse over the malicious data source path in `data_debug.php`. To perform the cross-site scripting attack, the adversary needs to be an authorized cacti user with the following permissions: `General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data`. The victim of this attack could be any account with permissions to view `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_debug.php`. As of time of publication, no complete fix has been included in Cacti.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49088", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCacti\u00bbCactiVersions  before (<) 1.2.25cpe:2.3:a:cacti:cacti:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-09-02  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-11  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-03-19  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-12-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: cacti-spine-1.2.27-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1jykueqxgsrc5w7w2xLB41hl78Y.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-hrg9-qqqx-wc4h", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability with Data Source Name when debugging Data Queries \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Cacti/cacti \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7sOVovvAoz604VzItr26inxXKJ0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00018.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3765-1] cacti security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9el7JXopYoM-du0MaQ0cz48JAao.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/5f6f65c215d663a775950b2d9db35edbaf07d680/data_debug.php", "ref_desc": "cacti/data_debug.php at 5f6f65c215d663a775950b2d9db35edbaf07d680 \u00b7 Cacti/cacti \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-q7g7-gcf6-wh4x", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability when viewing data sources in debug mode \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Cacti/cacti \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
