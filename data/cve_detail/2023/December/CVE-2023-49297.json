{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49297", "Description": "PyDrive2 is a wrapper library of google-api-python-client that simplifies many common Google Drive API V2 tasks. Unsafe YAML deserilization will result in arbitrary code execution. A maliciously crafted YAML file can cause arbitrary code execution if PyDrive2 is run in the same directory as it, or if it is loaded in via `LoadSettingsFile`. This is a deserilization attack that will affect any user who initializes GoogleAuth from this package while a malicious yaml file is present in the same directory. This vulnerability does not require the file to be directly loaded through the code, only present. This issue has been addressed in commit `c57355dc` which is included in release version `1.16.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49297", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIterative\u00bbPydrive2Versions  before (<) 1.16.2cpe:2.3:a:iterative:pydrive2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIterative\u00bbPydrive2\u00bbVersion:1.17.0cpe:2.3:a:iterative:pydrive2:1.17.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-12  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/iterative/PyDrive2/security/advisories/GHSA-v5f6-hjmf-9mc5", "ref_desc": "Unsafe YAML deserialization in LoadSettingsFile allows arbitrary code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 iterative/PyDrive2 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K34YWTDKBAYWZPOAKBYDM72WIFL5CAYW/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: PyDrive2-1.18.0-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CYR5SJKOFSSXFV3E3D2SLXBUBA5WMJJG/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: PyDrive2-1.18.0-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/iterative/PyDrive2/commit/c57355dc2033ad90b7050d681b2c3ba548ff0004", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-v5f6-hjmf-9mc5 \u00b7 iterative/PyDrive2@c57355d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
