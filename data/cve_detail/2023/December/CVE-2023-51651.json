{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-51651", "Description": "AWS SDK for PHP is the Amazon Web Services software development kit for PHP. Within the scope of requests to S3 object keys and/or prefixes containing a Unix double-dot, a URI path traversal is possible. The issue exists in the `buildEndpoint` method in the RestSerializer component of the AWS SDK for PHP v3 prior to 3.288.1. The `buildEndpoint` method relies on the Guzzle Psr7 UriResolver utility, which strips dot segments from the request path in accordance with RFC 3986. Under certain conditions, this could lead to an arbitrary object being accessed. This issue has been patched in version 3.288.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51651", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbAws Software Development Kit\u00bbForPHPVersions  before (<) 3.288.1cpe:2.3:a:amazon:aws_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:php:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/security/advisories/GHSA-557v-xcg6-rm5m", "ref_desc": "Potential URI resolution path traversal in the AWS SDK for PHP \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aws/aws-sdk-php \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/commit/aebc9f801438746ac4ade327551576cb75f635f2", "ref_desc": "bugfix: dot segment handling (#2835) \u00b7 aws/aws-sdk-php@aebc9f8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/releases/tag/3.288.1", "ref_desc": "Release Version 3.288.1 \u00b7 aws/aws-sdk-php \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
