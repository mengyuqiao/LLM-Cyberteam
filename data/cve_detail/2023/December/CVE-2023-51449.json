{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-51449", "Description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows you to quickly build a demo or web application for your machine learning model, API, or any arbitary Python function. Versions of `gradio` prior to 4.11.0 contained a vulnerability in the `/file` route which made them susceptible to file traversal attacks in which an attacker could access arbitrary files on a machine running a Gradio app with a public URL (e.g. if the demo was created with `share=True`, or on Hugging Face Spaces) if they knew the path of files to look for. This issue has been patched in version 4.11.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51449", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGradio Project\u00bbGradio\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 4.11.0cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "6.76% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  6.65%  6.76%  +0.11 \n 2  2024-10-05  7.67%  6.65%  -1.03 \n 3  2024-09-24  5.38%  7.67%  +2.30 \n 4  2024-09-11  5.59%  5.38%  -0.21 \n 5  2024-09-02  5.08%  5.59%  +0.51 \n 6  2024-08-09  3.38%  5.08%  +1.70 \n 7  2024-07-17  2.59%  3.38%  +0.80 \n 8  2024-07-06  3.08%  2.59%  -0.50 \n 9  2024-06-17  0.06%  3.08%  +3.02 \n 10  2024-01-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/7ba8c5da45b004edd12c0460be9222f5b5f5f055", "ref_desc": "Fix SSRF vulnerability on `/file=` route (#6794) \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio@7ba8c5d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/1b9d4234d6c25ef250d882c7b90e1f4039ed2d76", "ref_desc": "Prevent file traversals (#6833) \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio@1b9d423 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-6qm2-wpxq-7qh2", "ref_desc": "Make the `/file` secure against file traversal attacks and SSRF \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
