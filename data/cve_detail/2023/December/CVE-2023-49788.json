{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49788", "Description": "Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology. Unlike a standalone dedicated Collabora Online server, the Built-in CODE Server (richdocumentscode) is run without chroot sandboxing. Vulnerable versions of the richdocumentscode app can be susceptible to attack via modified client->server commands to overwrite files outside the sub directory the server has provided for the transient session. Files which can be accessed are limited to those that the server process has access to. The bug was fixed in Collabora Online - Built-in CODE Server (richdocumentscode) release 23.5.602. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49788", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-501 Trust Boundary Violation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/501/Trust-Boundary-Violation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/security/advisories/GHSA-3r69-xvf7-v94j", "ref_desc": "Improper handling of browser-side provided input in richdocuments path handling \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CollaboraOnline/online \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
