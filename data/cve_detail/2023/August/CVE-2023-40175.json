{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40175", "Description": "Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. Prior to versions 6.3.1 and 5.6.7, puma exhibited incorrect behavior when parsing chunked transfer encoding bodies and zero-length Content-Length headers in a way that allowed HTTP request smuggling. Severity of this issue is highly dependent on the nature of the web site using puma is. This could be caused by either incorrect parsing of trailing fields in chunked transfer encoding bodies or by parsing of blank/zero-length Content-Length headers. Both issues have been addressed and this vulnerability has been fixed in versions 6.3.1 and 5.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40175", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-19  0.46%  0.36%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.29%  0.46%  +0.17 \n 3  2024-07-18  0.25%  0.29%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-02-23  0.18%  0.25%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-02-08  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-08-25  0.05%  0.13%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-68xg-gqqm-vgj8", "ref_desc": "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling') in puma \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 puma/puma \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/690155e7d644b80eeef0a6094f9826ee41f1080a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-68xg-gqqm-vgj8 \u00b7 puma/puma@690155e \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
