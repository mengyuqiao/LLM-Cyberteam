{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36672", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Clario VPN client through 5.9.1.1662 for macOS. The VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such that traffic to the local network is sent in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel even if the local network is using a non-RFC1918 IP subnet. This allows an adversary to trick the victim into sending arbitrary IP traffic in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to \"LocalNet attack resulting in leakage of traffic in plaintext\" rather than to only Clario.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36672", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nClario\u00bbVPN\u00bbForMacosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.9.1.1662cpe:2.3:a:clario:vpn:*:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-08-19  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mullvad.net/de/blog/2023/8/9/response-to-tunnelcrack-vulnerability-disclosure/", "ref_desc": "Response to \"TunnelCrack\" vulnerability disclosure - Blog | Mullvad VPNThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://clario.co/vpn-for-mac/", "ref_desc": "Download VPN for Mac with Advanced Security Features | ClarioProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/D5JDVNKTPuYW0TVzn-I0lktkBEw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com/details.html", "ref_desc": "TunnelCrack: Widespread design flaws in VPN clientsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DR1xe-kqJcnGUOrbgzfBab9ij9c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0015", "ref_desc": "Security AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/um0aBJNLliLVtWSojcq0igIaewA.html"}]}
