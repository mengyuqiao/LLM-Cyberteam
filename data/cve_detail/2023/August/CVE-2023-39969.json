{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39969", "Description": "uthenticode is a small cross-platform library for partially verifying Authenticode digital signatures. Version 1.0.9 of uthenticode hashed the entire file rather than hashing sections by virtual address, in violation of the Authenticode specification. As a result, an attacker could modify code within a binary without changing its Authenticode hash, making it appear valid from uthenticode's perspective. Versions of uthenticode prior to 1.0.9 are not vulnerable to this attack, nor are versions in the 2.x series. By design, uthenticode does not perform full-chain validation. However, the malleability of signature verification introduced in 1.0.9 was an unintended oversight. The 2.x series addresses the vulnerability. Versions prior to 1.0.9 are also not vulnerable, but users are encouraged to upgrade rather than downgrade. There are no workarounds to this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39969", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTrailofbits\u00bbUthenticodeVersions  before (<) 1.0.9cpe:2.3:a:trailofbits:uthenticode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-10  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-15  0.08%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-07-09  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-18  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/security/advisories/GHSA-rc7g-99x7-4p9g", "ref_desc": "Signature validation bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 trailofbits/uthenticode \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/pull/84", "ref_desc": "Fix hashing by woodruffw \u00b7 Pull Request #84 \u00b7 trailofbits/uthenticode \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/commit/8670b7bb9154d79c276483dcb7c9e9fd5e66455b", "ref_desc": "Fix hashing (#84) \u00b7 trailofbits/uthenticode@8670b7b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
