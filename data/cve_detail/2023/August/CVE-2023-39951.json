{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39951", "Description": "OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation provides OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation and instrumentation libraries for Java. OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation prior to version 1.28.0 contains an issue related to the instrumentation of Java applications using the AWS SDK v2 with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) v1 API. When SES POST requests are instrumented, the query parameters of the request are inserted into the trace `url.path` field. This behavior leads to the http body, containing the email subject and message, to be present in the trace request url metadata. Any user using a version before 1.28.0 of OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation to instrument AWS SDK v2 call to SES\u2019s v1 SendEmail API is affected. The e-mail content sent to SES may end up in telemetry backend. This exposes the e-mail content to unintended audiences. The issue can be mitigated by updating OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation to version 1.28.0 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39951", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbOpentelemetry Instrumentation For JavaVersions  before (<) 1.28.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:opentelemetry_instrumentation_for_java:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-14  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-07-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/8956", "ref_desc": "AWS SDK instrumentation: HTTP POST body included in Span `http.url` \u00b7 Issue #8956 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/security/advisories/GHSA-hghr-r469-gfq6", "ref_desc": "Instrumentation for AWS SDK v2 captures email content when using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) v1 API, exposing that content to the telemetry backend \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-javaVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/pull/8931", "ref_desc": "Fix http attributes of AWS SDK V2 instrumentation by rapphil \u00b7 Pull Request #8931 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
