{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39910", "Description": "The cryptocurrency wallet entropy seeding mechanism used in Libbitcoin Explorer 3.0.0 through 3.6.0 is weak, aka the Milk Sad issue. The use of an mt19937 Mersenne Twister PRNG restricts the internal entropy to 32 bits regardless of settings. This allows remote attackers to recover any wallet private keys generated from \"bx seed\" entropy output and steal funds. (Affected users need to move funds to a secure new cryptocurrency wallet.) NOTE: the vendor's position is that there was sufficient documentation advising against \"bx seed\" but others disagree. NOTE: this was exploited in the wild in June and July 2023.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39910", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLibbitcoin\u00bbLibbitcoin ExplorerVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.6.0cpe:2.3:a:libbitcoin:libbitcoin_explorer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-13  0.18%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-15  0.13%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-07-09  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-09-07  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-08-23  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/blob/20eba4db9a8a3476949d6fd08a589abda7fde3e3/src/utility.cpp#L78", "ref_desc": "libbitcoin-explorer/src/utility.cpp at 20eba4db9a8a3476949d6fd08a589abda7fde3e3 \u00b7 libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/wiki/CVE-2023-39910", "ref_desc": "CVE 2023 39910 \u00b7 libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer Wiki \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://milksad.info/disclosure.html", "ref_desc": "Milk Sad: /full write-upThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/blob/a1b777fc51d9c04e0c7a1dec5cc746b82a6afe64/src/crypto/pseudo_random.cpp#L66C12-L78", "ref_desc": "libbitcoin-system/src/crypto/pseudo_random.cpp at a1b777fc51d9c04e0c7a1dec5cc746b82a6afe64 \u00b7 libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/blob/20eba4db9a8a3476949d6fd08a589abda7fde3e3/src/commands/seed.cpp#L44", "ref_desc": "libbitcoin-explorer/src/commands/seed.cpp at 20eba4db9a8a3476949d6fd08a589abda7fde3e3 \u00b7 libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37054862", "ref_desc": "Milk Sad Disclosure | Hacker NewsThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
