{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40274", "Description": "An issue was discovered in zola 0.13.0 through 0.17.2. The custom implementation of a web server, available via the \"zola serve\" command, allows directory traversal. The handle_request function, used by the server to process HTTP requests, does not account for sequences of special path control characters (../) in the URL when serving a file, which allows one to escape the webroot of the server and read arbitrary files from the filesystem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40274", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGetzola\u00bbZolaVersions  from including (>=) 0.13.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.17.2cpe:2.3:a:getzola:zola:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-15  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-20  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-07-14  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-23  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getzola/zola/issues/2257", "ref_desc": "LFI in zola serve \u00b7 Issue #2257 \u00b7 getzola/zola \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getzola/zola/pull/2258", "ref_desc": "Fix LFI in `zola serve` by adeadfed \u00b7 Pull Request #2258 \u00b7 getzola/zola \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
