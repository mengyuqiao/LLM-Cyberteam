{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32559", "Description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: 16.x, 18.x and, 20.x. The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()` can bypass the policy mechanism by requiring internal modules and eventually take advantage of `process.binding('spawn_sync')` run arbitrary code, outside of the limits defined in a `policy.json` file. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy is an experimental feature of Node.js.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32559", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 20.5.0cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 18.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 18.17.0cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 16.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 16.20.1cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-30  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-12  0.11%  0.05%  -0.06 \n 4  2023-09-02  0.04%  0.11%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0006/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-32559 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1946470", "ref_desc": "Node.js | Report #1946470 - Dependency Policy Bypass via process.binding | HackerOneExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
