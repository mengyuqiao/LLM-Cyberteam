{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37379", "Description": "Apache Airflow, in versions prior to 2.7.0, contains a security vulnerability that can be exploited by an authenticated user possessing Connection edit privileges. This vulnerability allows the user to access connection information and exploit the test connection feature by sending many requests, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition on the server. Furthermore, malicious actors can leverage this vulnerability to establish harmful connections with the server.\n\nUsers of Apache Airflow are strongly advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability. Additionally, administrators are encouraged to review and adjust user permissions to restrict access to sensitive functionalities, reducing the attack surface.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37379", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbAirflowVersions  before (<) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:airflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-24  0.19%  0.18%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-09-11  0.19%  0.19%  0.00 \n 3  2024-08-29  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-08-04  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-06-29  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-30  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-08-30  0.06%  0.13%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/23/4", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-37379: Apache Airflow: Exposure of sensitive connection information, DOS and SSRF on \"test connection\" featureMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/g5c9vcn27lr14go48thrjpo6f4vw571r", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-37379: Apache Airflow: Exposure of sensitive connection information, DOS and SSRF on \"test connection\" feature-Apache Mail ArchivesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/32052", "ref_desc": "Disable default allowing the testing of connections in UI, API and CLI by pankajkoti \u00b7 Pull Request #32052 \u00b7 apache/airflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
