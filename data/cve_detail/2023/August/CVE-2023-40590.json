{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40590", "Description": "GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories. When resolving a program, Python/Windows look for the current working directory, and after that the PATH environment. GitPython defaults to use the `git` command, if a user runs GitPython from a repo has a `git.exe` or `git` executable, that program will be run instead of the one in the user's `PATH`. This is more of a problem on how Python interacts with Windows systems, Linux and any other OS aren't affected by this. But probably people using GitPython usually run it from the CWD of a repo. An attacker can trick a user to download a repository with a malicious `git` executable, if the user runs/imports GitPython from that directory, it allows the attacker to run any arbitrary commands. There is no fix currently available for windows users, however there are a few mitigations. 1: Default to an absolute path for the git program on Windows, like `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\cmd\\\\git.EXE` (default git path installation). 2: Require users to set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` environment variable on Windows systems. 3: Make this problem prominent in the documentation and advise users to never run GitPython from an untrusted repo, or set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` env var to an absolute path. 4: Resolve the executable manually by only looking into the `PATH` environment variable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40590", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nGitpython Project\u00bbGitpython\u00bbForPythonVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.1.32cpe:2.3:a:gitpython_project:gitpython:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-09-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor", "ref_desc": "subprocess \u2014 Subprocess management \u2014 Python 3.11.5 documentationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4", "ref_desc": "Untrusted search path on Windows systems leading to arbitrary code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gitpython-developers/GitPython \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
