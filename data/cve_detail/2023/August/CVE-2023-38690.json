{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38690", "Description": "matrix-appservice-irc is a Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix. Prior to version 1.0.1, it is possible to craft a command with newlines which would not be properly parsed. This would mean you could pass a string of commands as a channel name, which would then be run by the IRC bridge bot. Versions 1.0.1 and above are patched. There are no robust workarounds to the bug. One may disable dynamic channels in the config to disable the most common execution method but others may exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38690", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbMatrix Irc Bridge\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix_irc_bridge:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-05  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-10  0.14%  0.14%  0.00 \n 3  2024-07-04  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-07  0.31%  0.12%  -0.20 \n 5  2023-09-13  0.22%  0.31%  +0.09 \n 6  2023-08-12  0.05%  0.22%  +0.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release 1.0.1 (2023-07-31) \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cRETgli_5qR0MADOJM2DtJo_3Uc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/commit/0afb064635d37e039067b5b3d6423448b93026d3", "ref_desc": "Add a test to ensure that the irc client state doesn't bloat on VERSI\u2026 \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc@0afb064 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-3pmj-jqqp-2mj3", "ref_desc": "IRC command injection via admin commands containing newlines \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
