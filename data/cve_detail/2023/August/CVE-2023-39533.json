{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39533", "Description": "go-libp2p is the Go implementation of the libp2p Networking Stack. Prior to versions 0.27.8, 0.28.2, and 0.29.1 malicious peer can use large RSA keys to run a resource exhaustion attack & force a node to spend time doing signature verification of the large key. This vulnerability is present in the core/crypto module of go-libp2p and can occur during the Noise handshake and the libp2p x509 extension verification step. To prevent this attack, go-libp2p versions 0.27.8, 0.28.2, and 0.29.1 restrict RSA keys to <= 8192 bits. To protect one's application, it is necessary to update to these patch releases and to use the updated Go compiler in 1.20.7 or 1.19.12. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39533", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLibp2p\u00bbGo-libp2p\u00bbForGOVersions  from including (>=) 0.28.0andbefore (<) 0.28.2cpe:2.3:a:libp2p:go-libp2p:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions\nLibp2p\u00bbGo-libp2p\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 0.27.8cpe:2.3:a:libp2p:go-libp2p:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions\nLibp2p\u00bbGo-libp2p\u00bbVersion:0.29.0ForGOcpe:2.3:a:libp2p:go-libp2p:0.29.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-09  0.15%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-14  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-07-08  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-08-16  0.04%  0.11%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/e30fcf7dfd4715ed89a5e68d7a4f774d3b9aa92d", "ref_desc": "core/crypto: restrict RSA keys to <= 8192 bits (#2454) \u00b7 libp2p/go-libp2p@e30fcf7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-876p-8259-xjgg", "ref_desc": "libp2p nodes vulnerable to attack using large RSA keys \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 libp2p/go-libp2p \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61460", "ref_desc": "crypto/tls: verifying certificate chains containing large RSA keys is slow [CVE-2023-29409] \u00b7 Issue #61460 \u00b7 golang/go \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Not Applicable;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/4012", "ref_desc": "update qtls to restrict RSA keys in certificates to <= 8192 bits by marten-seemann \u00b7 Pull Request #4012 \u00b7 quic-go/quic-go \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/0cce607219f3710addc7e18672cffd1f1d912fbb", "ref_desc": "core/crypto: restrict RSA keys to <= 8192 bits (#2454) \u00b7 libp2p/go-libp2p@0cce607 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/golang/go/commit/2350afd2e8ab054390e284c95d5b089c142db017", "ref_desc": "crypto/tls: restrict RSA keys in certificates to <= 8192 bits \u00b7 golang/go@2350afd \u00b7 GitHubNot Applicable;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/pull/2454", "ref_desc": "core/crypto: restrict RSA keys to <= 8192 bits by MarcoPolo \u00b7 Pull Request #2454 \u00b7 libp2p/go-libp2p \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/445be526aea4ee0b1fa5388aa65d32b2816d3a00", "ref_desc": "core/crypto: restrict RSA keys to <= 8192 bits (#2454) \u00b7 libp2p/go-libp2p@445be52 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
