{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41167", "Description": "@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer before 5.37.2 allows XSS attacks by content managers. This is a react component to render data coming from Webiny Headless CMS and Webiny Form Builder. Webiny is an open-source serverless enterprise CMS. The @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer package depends on the editor.js rich text editor to handle rich text content. The CMS stores rich text content from the editor.js into the database. When the @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer is used to render such content, it uses the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop, without applying HTML sanitization. The issue arises when an actor, who in this context would specifically be a content manager with access to the CMS, inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined input. This script is then injected and executed within the user's browser when the main page or admin page loads.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41167", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nWebiny\u00bbWebiny\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.37.2cpe:2.3:a:webiny:webiny:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-31  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://webiny.com", "ref_desc": "Open-Source Serverless CMS for Enterprises - Headless CMS & Page BuilderProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/security/advisories/GHSA-3x59-vrmc-5mx6", "ref_desc": "Insecure rendering of rich text content \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 webiny/webiny-js \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
