{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32077", "Description": "Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. Prior to versions 0.17.1 and 0.18.6, hardcoded DNS key usage has been found in Netmaker allowing unauth users to interact with DNS API endpoints. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6.  If users are using 0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them to the patched users. If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone who is using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image of the backend and restart the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32077", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGravitl\u00bbNetmakerVersions  from including (>=) 0.18.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.18.5cpe:2.3:a:gravitl:netmaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGravitl\u00bbNetmakerVersions  before (<) 0.17.1cpe:2.3:a:gravitl:netmaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "12.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-02  13.63%  12.33%  -1.30 \n 2  2024-09-25  12.92%  13.63%  +0.71 \n 3  2024-09-12  11.78%  12.92%  +1.14 \n 4  2024-08-30  9.85%  11.78%  +1.93 \n 5  2024-08-05  9.09%  9.85%  +0.76 \n 6  2024-07-24  9.58%  9.09%  -0.48 \n 7  2024-07-13  8.93%  9.58%  +0.65 \n 8  2024-06-19  9.72%  8.93%  -0.79 \n 9  2024-05-27  8.15%  9.72%  +1.57 \n 10  2024-05-14  7.21%  8.15%  +0.94 \n 11  2024-05-05  6.82%  7.21%  +0.38 \n 12  2024-04-30  0.06%  6.82%  +6.76 \n 13  2023-08-31  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/commit/1621c27c1d176b639e9768b2acad7693e387fd51", "ref_desc": "fixed hard coded dns key \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker@1621c27 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/pull/2170", "ref_desc": "GRA-1493: fixed hard coded dns key by 0xdcarns \u00b7 Pull Request #2170 \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/commit/9362c39a9a822f0e07361aa7c77af2610597e657", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2170 from gravitl/GRA-1493/dns-key \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker@9362c39 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/security/advisories/GHSA-8x8h-hcq8-jwwx", "ref_desc": "Hardcoded DNS Secret Key \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
