{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40034", "Description": "Woodpecker is a community fork of the Drone CI system. In affected versions an attacker can post malformed webhook data witch lead to an update of the repository data that can e.g. allow the takeover of an repo. This is only critical if the CI is configured for public usage and connected to a forge witch is also in public usage. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should secure the CI system by making it inaccessible to untrusted entities, for example, by placing it behind a firewall.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40034", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nWoodpecker-ci\u00bbWoodpeckerVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.0.2cpe:2.3:a:woodpecker-ci:woodpecker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-17  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-22  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-07-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-08-26  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/security/advisories/GHSA-4gcf-5m39-98mc", "ref_desc": "Validate webhook before change any data \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 woodpecker-ci/woodpecker \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/commit/6e4c2f84cc84661d58cf1c0e5c421a46070bb105", "ref_desc": "Validate webhook before change any data (#2221) (#2222) \u00b7 woodpecker-ci/woodpecker@6e4c2f8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2222", "ref_desc": "Validate webhook before change any data (#2221) by 6543 \u00b7 Pull Request #2222 \u00b7 woodpecker-ci/woodpecker \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2221", "ref_desc": "Validate webhook before change any data by 6543 \u00b7 Pull Request #2221 \u00b7 woodpecker-ci/woodpecker \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
