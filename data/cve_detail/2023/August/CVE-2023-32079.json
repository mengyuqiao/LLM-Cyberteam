{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32079", "Description": "Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. A Mass assignment vulnerability was found in versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6 that allows a non-admin user to escalate privileges to those of an admin user. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If Users are using 0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them to the patched users If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image of the backend and restart the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32079", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGravitl\u00bbNetmakerVersions  from including (>=) 0.18.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.18.5cpe:2.3:a:gravitl:netmaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGravitl\u00bbNetmakerVersions  before (<) 0.17.1cpe:2.3:a:gravitl:netmaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-30  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-07-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-31  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-915 Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/915/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Dynamically-Determined.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/security/advisories/GHSA-826j-8wp2-4x6q", "ref_desc": "Privilige Escalation: Non Admin To Admin User \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
