{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39349", "Description": "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version 22.1.0 and prior to version 23.7.2, an attacker with access to a token with few or no scopes can query `/api/0/api-tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests. There is no evidence that the issue was exploited on `sentry.io`. For self-hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth tokens. A fix is available in version 23.7.2 of `sentry` and `self-hosted`. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39349", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSentry\u00bbSentryVersions  from including (>=) 22.1.0andbefore (<) 23.7.2cpe:2.3:a:sentry:sentry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-13  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-9jcq-jf57-c62c", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation via ApiTokensEndpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/fad12c1150d1135edf9666ea72ca11bc110c1083", "ref_desc": "SessionNoAuthTokenAuthentication custom authenticator (#53850) \u00b7 getsentry/sentry@fad12c1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/53850", "ref_desc": "SessionNoAuthTokenAuthentication custom authenticator by oioki \u00b7 Pull Request #53850 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/releases/tag/23.7.2", "ref_desc": "Release 23.7.2 \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.7.2", "ref_desc": "Release 23.7.2 \u00b7 getsentry/self-hosted \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
