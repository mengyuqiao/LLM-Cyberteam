{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38497", "Description": "Cargo downloads the Rust project\u2019s dependencies and compiles the project. Cargo prior to version 0.72.2, bundled with Rust prior to version 1.71.1, did not respect the umask when extracting crate archives on UNIX-like systems. If the user downloaded a crate containing files writeable by any local user, another local user could exploit this to change the source code compiled and executed by the current user. To prevent existing cached extractions from being exploitable, the Cargo binary version 0.72.2 included in Rust 1.71.1 or later will purge caches generated by older Cargo versions automatically. As a workaround, configure one's system to prevent other local users from accessing the Cargo directory, usually located in `~/.cargo`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38497", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRust-lang\u00bbCargo\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.72.2cpe:2.3:a:rust-lang:cargo:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-278 Insecure Preserved Inherited Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/278/Insecure-Preserved-Inherited-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12443", "ref_desc": "Fix CVE-2023-38497 for master by pietroalbini \u00b7 Pull Request #12443 \u00b7 rust-lang/cargo \u00b7 GitHubMailing List;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QMEXGUGPW5OBSQA6URTBNDSU3RAEFOZ4/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: rust-1.71.1-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-security-response/tree/main/patches/CVE-2023-38497", "ref_desc": "wg-security-response/patches/CVE-2023-38497 at main \u00b7 rust-lang/wg-security-response \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask", "ref_desc": "umask - WikipediaNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/security/advisories/GHSA-j3xp-wfr4-hx87", "ref_desc": "Cargo not respecting umask when extracting crate archives \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-lang/cargo \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security", "ref_desc": "Security policy - Rust Programming LanguageProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rjE8krgKz8g7q80swXUNrdHlcA0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGKE6PGM4HIQUHPJRBQAHMELINSGN4H4/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: rust-1.71.1-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/commit/d78bbf4bde3c6b95caca7512f537c6f9721426ff", "ref_desc": "Auto merge of #12443 - pietroalbini:pa-cve-2023-38497-nightly, r=weih\u2026 \u00b7 rust-lang/cargo@d78bbf4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
