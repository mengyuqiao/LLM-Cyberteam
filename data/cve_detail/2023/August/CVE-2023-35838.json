{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-35838", "Description": "The WireGuard client 0.5.3 on Windows insecurely configures the operating system and firewall such that traffic to a local network that uses non-RFC1918 IP addresses is blocked. This allows an adversary to trick the victim into blocking IP traffic to selected IP addresses and services even while the VPN is enabled. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to \"LocalNet attack resulting in the blocking of traffic\" rather than to only WireGuard.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35838", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWireguard\u00bbWireguard\u00bbVersion:0.5.3cpe:2.3:a:wireguard:wireguard:0.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-08-18  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com/details.html", "ref_desc": "TunnelCrack: Widespread design flaws in VPN clientsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DR1xe-kqJcnGUOrbgzfBab9ij9c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0015", "ref_desc": "Security AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/um0aBJNLliLVtWSojcq0igIaewA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://wireguard.com", "ref_desc": "WireGuard: fast, modern, secure VPN tunnelProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
