{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39342", "Description": "Dangerzone is software for converting potentially dangerous PDFs, office documents, or images to safe PDFs. The Dangerzone CLI (`dangerzone-cli` command) logs output from the container where the file sanitization takes place, to the user's terminal. Prior to version 0.4.2, if the container is compromised and can return attacker-controlled strings, then the attacker may be able to spoof messages in the user's terminal or change the window title. Besides logging output from containers, it also logs the names of the files it sanitizes. If these files contain ANSI escape sequences, then the same issue applies. Dangerzone is predominantly a GUI application, so this issue should leave most of our users unaffected. Nevertheless, we always suggest updating to the newest version. This issue is fixed in Dangerzone 0.4.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39342", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFreedom\u00bbDangerzoneVersions  before (<) 0.4.2cpe:2.3:a:freedom:dangerzone:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-08-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-150 Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/150/Improper-Neutralization-of-Escape-Meta-or-Control-Sequence.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/releases/tag/v0.4.2", "ref_desc": "Release Dangerzone 0.4.2 \u00b7 freedomofpress/dangerzone \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/491", "ref_desc": "Sanitize sandbox output by apyrgio \u00b7 Pull Request #491 \u00b7 freedomofpress/dangerzone \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/security/advisories/GHSA-pvwq-6vpp-2632", "ref_desc": "Dangerzone CLI does not sanitize ANSI escape characters \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 freedomofpress/dangerzone \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
