{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40195", "Description": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Airflow Spark Provider.\n\nWhen the Apache Spark provider is installed on an Airflow deployment, an Airflow user that is authorized to configure Spark hooks can effectively run arbitrary code on the Airflow node by pointing it at a malicious Spark server. Prior to version 4.1.3, this was not called out in the documentation explicitly, so it is possible that administrators provided authorizations to configure Spark hooks without taking this into account. We recommend administrators to review their configurations to make sure the authorization to configure Spark hooks is only provided to fully trusted users.\n\nTo view the warning in the docs please visit\u00a0 https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-spark/4.1.3/connections/spark.html", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40195", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbAirflow Spark ProviderVersions  before (<) 4.1.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:airflow_spark_provider:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-03  0.12%  0.18%  +0.06 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-09-02  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/fzy95b1d6zv31j5wrx3znhzcscck2o24", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-40195: Apache Airflow Spark Provider Deserialization Vulnerability RCE-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33233", "ref_desc": "Add tip on host settings for Spark provider by pankajkoti \u00b7 Pull Request #33233 \u00b7 apache/airflow \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
