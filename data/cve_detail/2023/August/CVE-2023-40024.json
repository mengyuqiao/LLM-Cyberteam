{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40024", "Description": "ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition analysis pipelines. In the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly validated and sanitized, which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when attempting to access a detailed license view that does not exist. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the response generated by the `license_details_view` function. When unsuspecting users visit the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts, leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in release `32.5.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40024", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nNexb\u00bbScancode.ioVersions  up to, including, (<=) 32.5.1cpe:2.3:a:nexb:scancode.io:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-20  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/security/advisories/GHSA-6xcx-gx7r-rccj", "ref_desc": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in license endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nexB/scancode.io \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/blob/dd7769fbc97c84545579cebf1dc4838214098a11/CHANGELOG.rst#v3252-2023-08-14", "ref_desc": "scancode.io/CHANGELOG.rst at dd7769fbc97c84545579cebf1dc4838214098a11 \u00b7 nexB/scancode.io \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
