{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40037", "Description": "Apache NiFi 1.21.0 through 1.23.0 support JDBC and JNDI JMS access in several Processors and Controller Services with connection URL validation that does not provide sufficient protection against crafted inputs. An authenticated and authorized user can bypass connection URL validation using custom input formatting. The resolution enhances connection URL validation and introduces validation for additional related properties. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.1 is the recommended mitigation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40037", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbNifiVersions  from including (>=) 1.21.0andbefore (<) 1.23.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:nifi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-19  0.17%  0.16%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.10%  0.17%  +0.07 \n 3  2023-09-20  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-08-24  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/184/Incomplete-List-of-Disallowed-Inputs.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/697/Incorrect-Comparison.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/bqbjlrs2p5ghh8sbk5nsxb8xpf9l687q", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-40037: Apache NiFi: Incomplete Validation of JDBC and JNDI Connection URLs-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/18/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-40037: Apache NiFi: Incomplete Validation of JDBC and JNDI Connection URLsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2023-40037", "ref_desc": "Apache NiFi Security ReportsVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
