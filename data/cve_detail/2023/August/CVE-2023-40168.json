{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40168", "Description": "TurboWarp is a desktop application that compiles scratch projects to JavaScript. TurboWarp Desktop versions prior to version 1.8.0 allowed a malicious project or custom extension to read arbitrary files from disk and upload them to a remote server. The only required user interaction is opening the sb3 file or loading the extension. The web version of TurboWarp is not affected. This bug has been addressed in commit `55e07e99b59` after an initial fix which was reverted. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.8.0 or later. Users unable to upgrade should avoid opening sb3 files or loading extensions from untrusted sources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40168", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTurbowarp\u00bbTurbowarp DesktopVersions  before (<) 1.8.0cpe:2.3:a:turbowarp:turbowarp_desktop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-18  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-23  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-07-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-25  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TurboWarp/desktop/commit/f0f82aaf6cc8170e9da8b36953c98bfe533c019f", "ref_desc": "Fix some bugs related to protocols and file: URIs \u00b7 TurboWarp/desktop@f0f82aa \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TurboWarp/desktop/commit/a62dbd7a28b41857e3b6f32443fda0527d493267", "ref_desc": "Remove the code that broke Windows \u00b7 TurboWarp/desktop@a62dbd7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TurboWarp/desktop/commit/55e07e99b59db334d75e8f46792a1569ab0884a6", "ref_desc": "Rewrite CORS enforcement and offline extension cache \u00b7 TurboWarp/desktop@55e07e9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TurboWarp/desktop/security/advisories/GHSA-wg4p-vj7h-q82q", "ref_desc": "Malicious projects or extensions can read and upload arbitrary files from disk \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TurboWarp/desktop \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
