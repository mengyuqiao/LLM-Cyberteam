{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38697", "Description": "protocol-http1 provides a low-level implementation of the HTTP/1 protocol. RFC 9112 Section 7.1 defined the format of chunk size, chunk data and chunk extension. The value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits, the chunk size should be a string of hex digits and should split from chunk data using CRLF, and the chunk extension shouldn't contain any invisible character. However, Falcon has following behaviors while disobey the corresponding RFCs: accepting Content-Length header values that have `+` prefix, accepting Content-Length header values that written in hexadecimal with `0x` prefix, accepting `0x` and `+` prefixed chunk size, and accepting LF in chunk extension. This behavior can lead to desync when forwarding through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially results in HTTP request smuggling and firewall bypassing. This issue is fixed in `protocol-http1` v0.15.1. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38697", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSocketry\u00bbProtocol-http1Versions  before (<) 0.15.1cpe:2.3:a:socketry:protocol-http1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-05  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-08-10  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/socketry/protocol-http1/security/advisories/GHSA-6jwc-qr2q-7xwj", "ref_desc": "Strict validation of content length and chunk length. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 socketry/protocol-http1 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/socketry/protocol-http1/pull/20", "ref_desc": "Strict validation of content length and chunk length. by ioquatix \u00b7 Pull Request #20 \u00b7 socketry/protocol-http1 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#name-chunked-transfer-coding", "ref_desc": "RFC 9112: HTTP/1.1Technical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/socketry/protocol-http1/commit/e11fc164fd2b36f7b7e785e69fa8859eb06bcedd", "ref_desc": "Strict validation of content length and chunk length.
