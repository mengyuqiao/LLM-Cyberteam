{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38702", "Description": "Knowage is an open source analytics and business intelligence suite. Starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the endpoint `/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile` allows authenticated users to upload `template file` on the server, but does not need any authorization to be reached. When the JSP file is uploaded, the attacker just needs to connect to `/knowageqbeengine/foo.jsp` to gain code execution on the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with low privileges can upload a JSP file to the `knowageqbeengine` directory and gain code execution capability on the server. This issue has been patched in Knowage version 8.1.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38702", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nENG\u00bbKnowageVersions  from including (>=) 6.1.0andbefore (<) 8.1.8cpe:2.3:a:eng:knowage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-10  0.08%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-07-04  0.09%  0.08%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-06-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-08-10  0.04%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-7mjh-73q3-c3fc", "ref_desc": "Path traversal in upload functionalities \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
