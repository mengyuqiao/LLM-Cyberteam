{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40025", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting from version 2.6.0 have a bug where open web terminal sessions do not expire. This bug allows users to send any websocket messages even if the token has already expired. The most straightforward scenario is when a user opens the terminal view and leaves it open for an extended period. This allows the user to view sensitive information even when they should have been logged out already. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: 2.6.14, 2.7.12 and 2.8.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40025", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.6.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.13cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.7.11cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.7.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.8.0cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-29  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-23  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-08-31  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/e047efa8f9518c54d00d2e4493b64bc4dba98478", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-c8xw-vjgf-94hr \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd@e047efa \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-c8xw-vjgf-94hr", "ref_desc": "Web terminal session doesn't expire \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
