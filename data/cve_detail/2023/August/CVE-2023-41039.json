{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41039", "Description": "RestrictedPython is a restricted execution environment for Python to run untrusted code. Python's \"format\" functionality allows someone controlling the format string to \"read\" all objects accessible through recursive attribute lookup and subscription from objects he can access. This can lead to critical information disclosure. With `RestrictedPython`, the format functionality is available via the `format` and `format_map` methods of `str` (and `unicode`) (accessed either via the class or its instances) and via `string.Formatter`. All known versions of `RestrictedPython` are vulnerable. This issue has been addressed in commit `4134aedcff1` which has been included in the 5.4 and 6.2 releases. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41039", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nZope\u00bbRestrictedpythonVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.2cpe:2.3:a:zope:restrictedpython:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbRestrictedpythonVersions  before (<) 5.4cpe:2.3:a:zope:restrictedpython:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/commit/4134aedcff17c977da7717693ed89ce56d54c120", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xjw2-6jm9-rf67 \u00b7 zopefoundation/RestrictedPython@4134aed \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/security/advisories/GHSA-xjw2-6jm9-rf67", "ref_desc": "Sandbox escape via various forms of \"format\". \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/RestrictedPython \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
