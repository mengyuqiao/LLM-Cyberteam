{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40012", "Description": "uthenticode is a small cross-platform library for partially verifying Authenticode digital signatures. Versions of uthenticode prior to the 2.x series did not check Extended Key Usages in certificates, in violation of the Authenticode X.509 certificate profile. As a result, a malicious user could produce a \"signed\" PE file that uthenticode would verify and consider valid using an X.509 certificate that isn't entitled to produce code signatures (e.g., a SSL certificate). By design, uthenticode does not perform full-chain validation. However, the absence of EKU validation was an unintended oversight. The 2.0.0 release series includes EKU checks. There are no workarounds to this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40012", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTrailofbits\u00bbUthenticodeVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:trailofbits:uthenticode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-10  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-15  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-09  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-325 Missing Cryptographic Step", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/325/Missing-Cryptographic-Step.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/pull/78", "ref_desc": "src: bump OpenSSL, EKU check by woodruffw \u00b7 Pull Request #78 \u00b7 trailofbits/uthenticode \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/security/advisories/GHSA-gm2f-j4rj-6xqj", "ref_desc": "EKU validation bypass in uthenticode \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 trailofbits/uthenticode \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/commit/caeb1eb62412605f71bd96ce9bb9420644b6db53", "ref_desc": "src: bump OpenSSL, EKU check (#78) \u00b7 trailofbits/uthenticode@caeb1eb \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
