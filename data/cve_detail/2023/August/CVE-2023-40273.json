{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40273", "Description": "The session fixation vulnerability allowed the authenticated user to continue accessing Airflow webserver even after the password of the user has been reset by the admin - up until the expiry of the session of the user. Other than manually cleaning the session database (for database\u00a0session backend), or changing the secure_key and restarting the webserver, there were no mechanisms to force-logout the user (and all other users with that).\n\nWith this fix implemented, when using the\u00a0database\u00a0session backend, the existing sessions of the user are invalidated when the password of the user is reset. When using the securecookie\u00a0session backend, the sessions are NOT invalidated and still require changing the secure key and restarting the webserver (and logging out all other users), but the user resetting the password is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI. Documentation is also updated explaining this behaviour.\n\nUsers of Apache Airflow are advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40273", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbAirflowVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:airflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-29  0.14%  0.24%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-25  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-08-30  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/23/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-40273: Session fixation in Apache Airflow web interface", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/23/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-40273: Session fixation in Apache Airflow web interfaceMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/9rdmv8ln4y4ncbyrlmjrsj903x4l80nj", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-40273: Session fixation in Apache Airflow web interface-Apache Mail ArchivesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33347", "ref_desc": "Remove user sessions when resetting password by potiuk \u00b7 Pull Request #33347 \u00b7 apache/airflow \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
