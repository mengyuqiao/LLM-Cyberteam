{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39438", "Description": "A missing authorization check allows an arbitrary authenticated user to perform certain operations through the API of CLA-assistant by executing specific additional steps. This allows an arbitrary authenticated user to read CLA information including information of the persons who signed them as well as custom fields the CLA requester had configured. In addition, an arbitrary authenticated user can update or delete the CLA-configuration for repositories or organizations using CLA-assistant. The stored access tokens for GitHub are not affected, as these are redacted from the API-responses.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39438", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbContributor License Agreement AssistantVersions  before (<) 2.13.1cpe:2.3:a:sap:contributor_license_agreement_assistant:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-23  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-424 Improper Protection of Alternate Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/424/Improper-Protection-of-Alternate-Path.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant/security/advisories/GHSA-gw8p-frwv-25gh", "ref_desc": "Missing Authorization check allows certain operations on CLA Assistant data \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cla-assistant/cla-assistant \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
