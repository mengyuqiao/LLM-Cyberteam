{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32078", "Description": "Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was found in versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6 in the user update function. By specifying another user's username, it was possible to update the other user's password. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If Users are using 0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them to the patched users. If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image of the backend and restart the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32078", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGravitl\u00bbNetmakerVersions  from including (>=) 0.18.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.18.5cpe:2.3:a:gravitl:netmaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGravitl\u00bbNetmakerVersions  before (<) 0.17.1cpe:2.3:a:gravitl:netmaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-25  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-30  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/security/advisories/GHSA-256m-j5qw-38f4", "ref_desc": "IDOR To Update Other User's Password \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/pull/2158", "ref_desc": "add checks to user update processing by mattkasun \u00b7 Pull Request #2158 \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/commit/b3be57c65bf0bbfab43b66853c8e3637a43e2839", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2158 from gravitl/GRA-1479-user-updates \u00b7 gravitl/netmaker@b3be57c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
