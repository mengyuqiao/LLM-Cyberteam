{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40571", "Description": "weblogic-framework is a tool for detecting weblogic vulnerabilities. Versions 0.2.3 and prior do not verify the returned data packets, and there is a deserialization vulnerability which may lead to remote code execution. When weblogic-framework gets the command echo, it directly deserializes the data returned by the server without verifying it. At the same time, the classloader loads a lot of deserialization calls. In this case, the malicious serialized data returned by the server will cause remote code execution. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40571", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nWeblogic-framework Project\u00bbWeblogic-frameworkVersions  before (<) 0.2.4cpe:2.3:a:weblogic-framework_project:weblogic-framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.74%  0.52%  -0.22 \n 2  2024-09-26  0.46%  0.74%  +0.28 \n 3  2024-09-13  0.45%  0.46%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-08-31  0.23%  0.45%  +0.22 \n 5  2024-07-25  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-05-28  0.14%  0.20%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-09-02  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dream0x01/weblogic-framework/releases/tag/v0.2.4", "ref_desc": "Release v0.2.4.RELEASE \u00b7 dream0x01/weblogic-framework \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dream0x01/weblogic-framework/security/advisories/GHSA-hjwj-4f3q-44h3", "ref_desc": "\u62a5\u544aweblogic-framework 0.2.3\u7248\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6f0f\u6d1e \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dream0x01/weblogic-framework \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
