{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32678", "Description": "Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with topic-based threading that combines email and chat. Users who used to be subscribed to a private stream and have been removed from it since retain the ability to edit messages/topics, move messages to other streams, and delete messages that they used to have access to, if other relevant organization permissions allow these actions. For example, a user may be able to edit or delete their old messages they posted in such a private stream. An administrator will be able to delete old messages (that they had access to) from the private stream. This issue was fixed in Zulip Server version 7.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32678", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulip ServerVersions  before (<) 7.3cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-31  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-q3wg-jm9p-35fj", "ref_desc": "Insufficient authorization check for edition/deletion of messages and topics in private streams by former subscribers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/changelog.html#zulip-server-7-3", "ref_desc": "Version history \u2014 Zulip 8.0-dev+git documentationRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
