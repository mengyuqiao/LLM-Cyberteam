{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40177", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any registered user can use the content field of their user profile page to execute arbitrary scripts with programming rights, thus effectively performing rights escalation. This issue is present since version 4.3M2 when AppWithinMinutes Application added support for the Content field, allowing any wiki page (including the user profile page) to use its content as an AWM Content field, which has a custom displayer that executes the content with the rights of the ``AppWithinMinutes.Content`` author, rather than the rights of the content author. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1. The fix is in the content of the AppWithinMinutes.Content page that defines the custom displayer. By using the ``display`` script service to render the content we make sure that the proper author is used for access rights checks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40177", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 4.3.1andbefore (<) 14.10.5cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:15.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:15.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:15.0cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:15.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:4.3UpdateMilestone2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:4.3:milestone2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-29  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 2  2024-07-23  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-29  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-12-08  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 5  2023-08-30  0.05%  0.13%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-95 Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/95/Improper-Neutralization-of-Directives-in-Dynamically-Evaluat.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-7369", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-7369] Add document title and document content to the field palette (class editor) - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dfb1cde173e363ca5c12eb3654869f9719820262", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19906: Render the AppWithinMinutes Content field as its author \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@dfb1cde \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-5mf8-v43w-mfxp", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation (PR) from account through AWM content fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
