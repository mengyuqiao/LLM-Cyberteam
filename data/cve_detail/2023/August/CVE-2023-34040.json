{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34040", "Description": "In Spring for Apache Kafka 3.0.9 and earlier and versions 2.9.10 and earlier, a possible deserialization attack vector existed, but only if unusual configuration was applied. An attacker would have to construct a malicious serialized object in one of the deserialization exception record headers.\n\nSpecifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:\n\n  *  The user does not\u00a0configure an ErrorHandlingDeserializer for the key and/or value of the record\n  *  The user explicitly sets container properties checkDeserExWhenKeyNull and/or checkDeserExWhenValueNull container properties to true.\n  *  The user allows untrusted sources to publish to a Kafka topic\n\n\nBy default, these properties are false, and the container only attempts to deserialize the headers if an ErrorHandlingDeserializer is configured. The ErrorHandlingDeserializer prevents the vulnerability by removing any such malicious headers before processing the record.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34040", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVmware\u00bbSpring For Apache KafkaVersions  from including (>=) 2.8.1andup to, including, (<=) 2.9.10cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_for_apache_kafka:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbSpring For Apache KafkaVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.0.9cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_for_apache_kafka:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-34040", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-34040: Java Deserialization vulnerability in Spring-Kafka When Improperly ConfiguredMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
