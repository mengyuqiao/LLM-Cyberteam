{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37581", "Description": "Insufficient input validation and sanitation in Weblog Category name, Website About and File Upload features in all versions of Apache Roller on all platforms allows an authenticated user to perform an XSS attack. Mitigation: if you do not have Roller configured for untrusted users, then you need to do nothing because you trust your users to author raw HTML and other web content. If you are running with untrusted users then you should upgrade to Roller 6.1.2 and you should disable Roller's File Upload feature.?", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37581", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbRollerVersions  before (<) 6.1.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:roller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-12  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-02-11  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2023-09-08  0.07%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-08-11  0.04%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/16/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: CVE-2023-37581: Apache Roller: XSS vulnerability for site with untrusted users", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/43", "ref_desc": "SecLists.Org Security Mailing List ArchiveNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/at1jXLmsEaQfH4pVRWiPdRAUo3o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/n9mjhhlm7z7b7to646tkvf3otkf21flp", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-37581: Apache Roller: XSS vulnerability for site with untrusted users-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/16/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: CVE-2023-37581: Apache Roller: XSS vulnerability for site with untrusted users", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
