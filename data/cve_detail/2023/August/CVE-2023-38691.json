{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38691", "Description": "matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to. A malicious actor could spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a `sub` parameter according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests. Versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1 contain a patch. As a workaround, disable the provisioning API.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38691", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbMatrix-appservice-bridge\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 8.1.2cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix-appservice-bridge:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nMatrix\u00bbMatrix-appservice-bridge\u00bbVersion:9.0.0ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix-appservice-bridge:9.0.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-12  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/security/advisories/GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x", "ref_desc": "matrix-appservice-bridge doesn't verify the sub parameter of an openId token exchange, allowing unauthorized access to provisioning APIs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/commit/4c6723a5e7beda65cdf1ae5dbb882e8beaac8552", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge@4c6723a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
