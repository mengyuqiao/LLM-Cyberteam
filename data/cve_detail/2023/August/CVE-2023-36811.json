{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36811", "Description": "borgbackup is an opensource, deduplicating archiver with compression and authenticated encryption. A flaw in the cryptographic authentication scheme in borgbackup allowed an attacker to fake archives and potentially indirectly cause backup data loss in the repository. The attack requires an attacker to be able to: 1. insert files (with no additional headers) into backups and 2. gain write access to the repository. This vulnerability does not disclose plaintext to the attacker, nor does it affect the authenticity of existing archives. Creating plausible fake archives may be feasible for empty or small archives, but is unlikely for large archives. The issue has been fixed in borgbackup 1.2.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Additionally to installing the fixed code, users must follow the upgrade procedure as documented in the change log. Data loss after being attacked can be avoided by reviewing the archives (timestamp and contents valid and as expected) after any \"borg check --repair\" and before \"borg prune\". There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36811", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBorgbackup\u00bbBorgVersions  before (<) 1.2.5cpe:2.3:a:borgbackup:borg:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-05  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/commit/3eb070191da10c2d3f7bc6484cf3d51c3045f884", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #7789 from ThomasWaldmann/archive-tam-verify-master \u00b7 borgbackup/borg@3eb0701 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZUCQSMAWOJBCRGF6XPKEZ2TPGAPNKIWV/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: borgbackup-1.2.6-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5Q3OHXERTU547SEQ3YREZXHOCYNLVD63/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: borgbackup-1.2.6-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XOZDFIYEBIOKSIEAXUJJJFUJTAJ7TF3C/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: borgbackup-1.2.6-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/blob/1.2.5-cvedocs/docs/changes.rst#pre-125-archives-spoofing-vulnerability-cve-2023-36811", "ref_desc": "borg/docs/changes.rst at 1.2.5-cvedocs \u00b7 borgbackup/borg \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/security/advisories/GHSA-8fjr-hghr-4m99", "ref_desc": "Pre-1.2.5 archives spoofing vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 borgbackup/borg \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
