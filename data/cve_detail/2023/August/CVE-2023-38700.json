{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38700", "Description": "matrix-appservice-irc is a Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix. Prior to version 1.0.1, it was possible to craft an event such that it would leak part of a targeted message event from another bridged room. This required knowing an event ID to target. Version 1.0.1n fixes this issue. As a workaround, set the `matrixHandler.eventCacheSize` config value to `0`. This workaround may impact performance.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38700", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbMatrix Irc Bridge\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:matrix:matrix_irc_bridge:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-05  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-10  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-08-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release 1.0.1 (2023-07-31) \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cRETgli_5qR0MADOJM2DtJo_3Uc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/commit/8bbd2b69a16cbcbeffdd9b5c973fd89d61498d75", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc@8bbd2b6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-c7hh-3v6c-fj4q", "ref_desc": "Events can be crafted to leak parts of targeted messages from other bridged rooms \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
