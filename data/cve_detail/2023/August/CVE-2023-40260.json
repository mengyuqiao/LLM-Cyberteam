{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40260", "Description": "EmpowerID before 7.205.0.1 allows an attacker to bypass an MFA (multi factor authentication) requirement if the first factor (username and password) is known, because the first factor is sufficient to change an account's email address, and the product would then send MFA codes to the new email address (which may be attacker-controlled). NOTE: this is different from CVE-2023-4177, which claims to be about \"some unknown processing of the component Multi-Factor Authentication Code Handler\" and thus cannot be correlated with other vulnerability information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40260", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nEmpowerid\u00bbEmpoweridVersions  before (<) 7.205.0.1cpe:2.3:a:empowerid:empowerid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-12  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-17  0.10%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-07-11  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-23  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40260", "ref_desc": "NVD - CVE-2023-40260", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Aug/3", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Unauthorized MFA Code Delivery in EmpowerIDMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ULANCfLKS7YDf0epmQ1xAoTz300.html"}]}
