{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32302", "Description": "Silverstripe Framework is the MVC framework that powers Silverstripe CMS. When a new member record is created and a password is not set, an empty encrypted password is generated. As a result, if someone is aware of the existence of a member record associated with a specific email address, they can potentially attempt to log in using that empty password. Although the default member authenticator and login form require a non-empty password, alternative authentication methods might still permit a successful login with the empty password. This issue has been patched in versions 4.13.4 and 5.0.13.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32302", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSilverstripe\u00bbFrameworkVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.13cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbFrameworkVersions  before (<) 4.3.14cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:framework:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-05  0.06%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-09-02  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-08-05  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/commit/7b21b38ac4532d06565dfcefad50540ebd2b50f4", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2023-32302] Require password field to be non-empty \u00b7 silverstripe/silverstripe-framework@7b21b38 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/releases/tag/4.13.14", "ref_desc": "Release 4.13.14 \u00b7 silverstripe/silverstripe-framework \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/releases/tag/5.0.13", "ref_desc": "Release 5.0.13 \u00b7 silverstripe/silverstripe-framework \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/security/advisories/GHSA-36xx-7vf6-7mv3", "ref_desc": "Members with no password can be created and bypass custom login forms \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 silverstripe/silverstripe-framework \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
