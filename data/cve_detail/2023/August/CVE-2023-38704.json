{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38704", "Description": "import-in-the-middle is a module loading interceptor specifically for ESM modules. The import-in-the-middle loader works by generating a wrapper module on the fly. The wrapper uses the module specifier to load the original module and add some wrapping code. Prior to version 1.4.2, it allows for remote code execution in cases where an application passes user-supplied input directly to the `import()` function. This vulnerability has been patched in import-in-the-middle version 1.4.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Do not pass any user-supplied input to `import()`. Instead, verify it against a set of allowed values. If using import-in-the-middle, directly or indirectly, and support for EcmaScript Modules is not needed, ensure that no options are set, either via command-line or the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable, that would enable loader hooks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38704", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDatadoghq\u00bbImport-in-the-middle\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.4.2cpe:2.3:a:datadoghq:import-in-the-middle:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.72% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-08  0.43%  0.72%  +0.29 \n 2  2024-08-13  0.26%  0.43%  +0.17 \n 3  2024-07-07  0.22%  0.26%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-09-08  0.27%  0.22%  -0.05 \n 5  2023-08-12  0.05%  0.27%  +0.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DataDog/import-in-the-middle/security/advisories/GHSA-5r27-rw8r-7967", "ref_desc": "Unsanitized user controlled input in module generation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DataDog/import-in-the-middle \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DataDog/import-in-the-middle/commit/2531cdd9d1d73f9eaa87c16967f60cb276c1971b", "ref_desc": "sanitize URLs \u00b7 DataDog/import-in-the-middle@2531cdd \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
