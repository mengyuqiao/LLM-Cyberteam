{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36671", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Clario VPN client through 5.9.1.1662 for macOS. The VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such that all IP traffic to the VPN server's IP address is sent in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel even if this traffic is not generated by the VPN client. This allows an adversary to trick the victim into sending plaintext traffic to the VPN server's IP address and thereby deanonymize the victim. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to \"ServerIP attack for only traffic to the real IP address of the VPN server\" rather than to only Clario.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36671", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nClario\u00bbVPN\u00bbForMacosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.9.1.1662cpe:2.3:a:clario:vpn:*:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-08-23  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://clario.co/vpn-for-mac/", "ref_desc": "Download VPN for Mac with Advanced Security Features | ClarioProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/D5JDVNKTPuYW0TVzn-I0lktkBEw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com/details.html", "ref_desc": "TunnelCrack: Widespread design flaws in VPN clientsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DR1xe-kqJcnGUOrbgzfBab9ij9c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0015", "ref_desc": "Security AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/um0aBJNLliLVtWSojcq0igIaewA.html"}]}
