{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39520", "Description": "Cryptomator encrypts data being stored on cloud infrastructure. The MSI installer provided on the homepage for Cryptomator version 1.9.2 allows local privilege escalation for low privileged users, via the `repair` function. The problem occurs as the repair function of the MSI is spawning an SYSTEM Powershell without the `-NoProfile` parameter. Therefore the profile of the user starting the repair will be loaded. Version 1.9.3 contains a fix for this issue. Adding a `-NoProfile` to the powershell is a possible workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39520", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCryptomator\u00bbCryptomatorVersions  before (<) 1.9.3cpe:2.3:a:cryptomator:cryptomator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/security/advisories/GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3", "ref_desc": "Cryptomator <= 1.9.2 Local Elevation of Privileges \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cryptomator/cryptomator \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/727c32ad50c3901a6144a11cf984a3b7ebcf8b2b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-62gx-54j7-mjh3 \u00b7 cryptomator/cryptomator@727c32a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.9.3", "ref_desc": "Release 1.9.3 (Windows Only) \u00b7 cryptomator/cryptomator \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/download/1.9.2/Cryptomator-1.9.2-x64.msi", "ref_desc": "Product", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
