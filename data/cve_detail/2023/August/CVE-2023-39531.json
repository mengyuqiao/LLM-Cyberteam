{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39531", "Description": "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version 10.0.0 and prior to version 23.7.2, an attacker with sufficient client-side exploits could retrieve a valid access token for another user during the OAuth token exchange due to incorrect credential validation. The client ID must be known and the API application must have already been authorized on the targeted user account. Sentry SaaS customers do not need to take any action. Self-hosted installations should upgrade to version 23.7.2 or higher. There are no direct workarounds, but users should review applications authorized on their account and remove any that are no longer needed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39531", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSentry\u00bbSentryVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 23.7.2cpe:2.3:a:sentry:sentry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-18  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-hgj4-h2x3-rfx4", "ref_desc": "Incorrect credential validation on OAuth token requests \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 getsentry/sentry \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
