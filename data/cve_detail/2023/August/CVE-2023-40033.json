{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40033", "Description": "Flarum is an open source forum software. Flarum is affected by a vulnerability that allows an attacker to conduct a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack or disclose any file on the server, even with a basic user account on any Flarum forum. By uploading a file containing a URL and spoofing the MIME type, an attacker can manipulate the application to execute unintended actions. The vulnerability is due to the behavior of the `intervention/image` package, which attempts to interpret the supplied file contents as a URL, which then fetches its contents. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks, disclose local file contents, or conduct a blind oracle attack. This has been patched in Flarum version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable PHP's `allow_url_fopen` which will prevent the fetching of external files via URLs as a temporary workaround for the SSRF aspect of the vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40033", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nFlarum\u00bbFlarumVersions  before (<) 1.8.0cpe:2.3:a:flarum:flarum:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-16  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-08-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/d1059c1cc79fe61f9538f3da55e8f42abbede570", "ref_desc": "fix: improve avatar upload functionality \u00b7 flarum/framework@d1059c1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-67c6-q4j4-hccg", "ref_desc": "LFI and Blind SSRF via Avatar upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flarum/framework \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
