{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39523", "Description": "ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition analysis with ScanPipe pipelines. Prior to version 32.5.1, the software has a possible command injection vulnerability in the docker fetch process as it allows to append malicious commands in the `docker_reference` parameter.\n\nIn the function `scanpipe/pipes/fetch.py:fetch_docker_image` the parameter `docker_reference` is user controllable. The `docker_reference` variable is then passed to the vulnerable function `get_docker_image_platform`.  However, the `get_docker_image_plaform` function constructs a shell command with the passed `docker_reference`. The `pipes.run_command` then executes the shell command without any prior sanitization, making the function vulnerable to command injections. A malicious user who is able to create or add inputs to a project can inject commands. Although the command injections are blind and the user will not receive direct feedback without logs, it is still possible to cause damage to the server/container. The vulnerability appears for example if a malicious user adds a semicolon after the input of `docker://;`, it would allow appending malicious commands.\n\nVersion 32.5.1 contains a patch for this issue. The `docker_reference` input should be sanitized to avoid command injections and, as a workaround, one may avoid creating commands with user controlled input directly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39523", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNexb\u00bbScancode.ioVersions  before (<) 32.5.1cpe:2.3:a:nexb:scancode.io:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.18%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-20  0.17%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-26  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-08-13  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-08-02  0.09%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-07-07  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-06-02  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-01-18  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 9  2023-08-12  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/commit/07ec0de1964b14bf085a1c9a27ece2b61ab6105c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2ggp-cmvm-f62f \u00b7 nexB/scancode.io@07ec0de \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/releases/tag/v32.5.1", "ref_desc": "Release v32.5.1 (Security Release) \u00b7 nexB/scancode.io \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/blob/main/scanpipe/pipes/fetch.py#L185", "ref_desc": "scancode.io/scanpipe/pipes/fetch.py at main \u00b7 nexB/scancode.io \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/security/advisories/GHSA-2ggp-cmvm-f62f", "ref_desc": "Command injection in docker image fetch process \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nexB/scancode.io \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
