{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39964", "Description": "1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management panel. In version 1.4.3, arbitrary file reads allow an attacker to read arbitrary important configuration files on the server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called `LoadFromFile`, which directly reads the file by obtaining the requested path `parameter[path]`. The request parameters are not filtered, resulting in a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39964", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nFit2cloud\u00bb1panel\u00bbVersion:1.4.3cpe:2.3:a:fit2cloud:1panel:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-11  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-16  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-07-10  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-08-18  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/security/advisories/GHSA-pv7q-v9mv-9mh5", "ref_desc": "1Panel O&M management panel has a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 1Panel-dev/1Panel \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/releases/tag/v1.5.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.5.0 \u00b7 1Panel-dev/1Panel \u00b7 GitHubProduct;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/UipjSPnpcTvIwGL--mzlaoBzJR0.html"}]}
