{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38831", "Description": "RARLAB WinRAR before 6.23 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user attempts to view a benign file within a ZIP archive. The issue occurs because a ZIP archive may include a benign file (such as an ordinary .JPG file) and also a folder that has the same name as the benign file, and the contents of the folder (which may include executable content) are processed during an attempt to access only the benign file. This was exploited in the wild in April through October 2023.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38831", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nRarlab\u00bbWinrarVersions  before (<) 6.23cpe:2.3:a:rarlab:winrar:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "48.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-27  43.88%  48.60%  +4.72 \n 2  2024-10-19  40.85%  43.88%  +3.03 \n 3  2024-09-24  31.24%  40.85%  +9.61 \n 4  2024-08-29  25.33%  31.24%  +5.91 \n 5  2024-08-18  24.77%  25.33%  +0.56 \n 6  2024-08-04  21.73%  24.77%  +3.04 \n 7  2024-07-23  19.86%  21.73%  +1.87 \n 8  2024-07-12  19.18%  19.86%  +0.68 \n 9  2024-06-29  21.36%  19.18%  -2.18 \n 10  2024-06-28  34.61%  21.36%  -13.25 \n 11  2024-06-18  38.12%  34.61%  -3.51 \n 12  2024-05-13  35.46%  33.85%  -1.61 \n 13  2024-05-04  44.37%  35.46%  -8.91 \n 14  2024-04-10  40.42%  44.37%  +3.96 \n 15  2024-03-31  32.62%  40.42%  +7.80 \n 16  2024-03-18  34.49%  32.62%  -1.87 \n 17  2024-02-28  33.60%  34.49%  +0.89 \n 18  2024-02-13  27.20%  33.60%  +6.40 \n 19  2024-02-03  26.61%  27.20%  +0.60 \n 20  2024-01-26  28.86%  26.61%  -2.26 \n 21  2024-01-02  23.40%  28.86%  +5.46 \n 22  2023-10-19  23.88%  23.40%  -0.47 \n 23  2023-09-18  24.50%  23.88%  -0.63 \n 24  2023-09-08  0.38%  24.50%  +24.12 \n 25  2023-08-30  0.68%  0.38%  -0.29 \n 26  2023-08-25  0.05%  0.68%  +0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-351 Insufficient Type Distinction", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/351/Insufficient-Type-Distinction.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174573/WinRAR-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "WinRAR Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.group-ib.com/blog/cve-2023-38831-winrar-zero-day/", "ref_desc": "Cybersecurity Services, Solutions & Products.
