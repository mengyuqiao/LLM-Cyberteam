{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-36673", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Avira Phantom VPN through 2.23.1 for macOS. The VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such that all IP traffic to the VPN server's IP address is sent in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel, even if this traffic is not generated by the VPN client, while simultaneously using plaintext DNS to look up the VPN server's IP address. This allows an adversary to trick the victim into sending traffic to arbitrary IP addresses in plaintext outside the VPN tunnel. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to \"ServerIP attack, combined with DNS spoofing, that can leak traffic to an arbitrary IP address\" rather than to only Avira Phantom VPN.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36673", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAvira\u00bbPhantom Vpn\u00bbForMacosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.23.1cpe:2.3:a:avira:phantom_vpn:*:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-08-18  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.avira.com/en/free-vpn", "ref_desc": "Download free VPN - surf anonymously | AviraProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com/details.html", "ref_desc": "TunnelCrack: Widespread design flaws in VPN clientsExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DR1xe-kqJcnGUOrbgzfBab9ij9c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0015", "ref_desc": "Security AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/um0aBJNLliLVtWSojcq0igIaewA.html"}]}
