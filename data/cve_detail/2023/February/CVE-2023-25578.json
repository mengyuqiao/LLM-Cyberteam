{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25578", "Description": "Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to version 1.5.2, the request body parsing in `starlite` allows a potentially unauthenticated attacker to consume a large amount of CPU time and RAM. The multipart body parser processes an unlimited number of file parts and an unlimited number of field parts. This is a remote, potentially unauthenticated Denial of Service vulnerability. This vulnerability affects applications with a request handler that accepts a `Body(media_type=RequestEncodingType.MULTI_PART)`. The large amount of CPU time required for processing requests can block all available worker processes and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate user requests. The large amount of RAM accumulated while processing requests can lead to Out-Of-Memory kills. Complete DoS is achievable by sending many concurrent multipart requests in a loop. Version 1.51.2 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25578", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nStarliteproject\u00bbStarliteVersions  before (<) 1.51.2cpe:2.3:a:starliteproject:starlite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-07  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-28  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-19  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-22  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-01-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-31  0.08%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-05-08  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.08%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/commit/9674fe803628f986c03fe60769048cbc55b5bf83", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-p24m-863f-fm6q \u00b7 starlite-api/starlite@9674fe8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/releases/tag/v1.51.2", "ref_desc": "Release v1.51.2 \u00b7 starlite-api/starlite \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/security/advisories/GHSA-p24m-863f-fm6q", "ref_desc": "DoS vulnerability when parsing multipart request body \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 starlite-api/starlite \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
