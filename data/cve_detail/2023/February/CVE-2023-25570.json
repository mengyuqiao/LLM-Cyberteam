{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25570", "Description": "Apollo is a configuration management system. Prior to version 2.1.0, there are potential security issues if users expose apollo-configservice to the internet, which is not recommended. This is because there is no authentication feature enabled for the built-in eureka service. Malicious hackers may access eureka directly to mock apollo-configservice and apollo-adminservice. Login authentication for eureka was added in version 2.1.0. As a workaround, avoid exposing apollo-configservice to the internet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25570", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApolloconfig\u00bbApolloVersions  before (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:apolloconfig:apollo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-12  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2024-08-02  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-24  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-27  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/security/advisories/GHSA-368x-wmmg-hq5c", "ref_desc": "Potential access control security issue in eureka \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 apolloconfig/apollo \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/commit/7df79bf8df6960433ed4ff782a54e3dfc74632bd", "ref_desc": "Enable login authentication for eureka \u00b7 apolloconfig/apollo@7df79bf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/pull/4663", "ref_desc": "Enable login authentication for eureka by nobodyiam \u00b7 Pull Request #4663 \u00b7 apolloconfig/apollo \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/releases/tag/v2.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release Apollo 2.1.0 Release \u00b7 apolloconfig/apollo \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pMt0nGZKQCSno06yFn796Kn5AQw.html"}]}
