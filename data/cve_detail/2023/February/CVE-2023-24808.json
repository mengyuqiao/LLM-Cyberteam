{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24808", "Description": "PDFio is a C library for reading and writing PDF files. In versions prior to 1.1.0 a denial of service (DOS) vulnerability exists in the pdfio parser. Crafted pdf files can cause the program to run at 100% utilization and never terminate. The pdf which causes this crash found in testing is about 28kb in size and was discovered via fuzzing. Anyone who uses this library either as a standalone binary or as a library can be DOSed when attempting to parse this type of file. Web servers or other automated processes which rely on this code to turn pdf submissions into plaintext can be DOSed when an attacker uploads the pdf. Please see the linked GHSA for an example pdf. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24808", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPdfio Project\u00bbPdfioVersions  before (<) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:pdfio_project:pdfio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-30  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-14  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/michaelrsweet/pdfio/security/advisories/GHSA-cjc4-x96x-fvgf", "ref_desc": "Denial Of Service when opening a corrupt PDF file \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 michaelrsweet/pdfio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/michaelrsweet/pdfio/commit/4f10021e7ee527c1aa24853e2947e38e154d9ccb", "ref_desc": "Fix denial-of-service attack when reading corrupt PDF files. \u00b7 michaelrsweet/pdfio@4f10021 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
