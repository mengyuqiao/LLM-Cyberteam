{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25165", "Description": "Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.`getHostByName` is a Helm template function introduced in Helm v3. The function is able to accept a hostname and return an IP address for that hostname. To get the IP address the function performs a DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when used with `helm install|upgrade|template` or when the Helm SDK is used to render a chart. Information passed into the chart can be disclosed to the DNS servers used to lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart could inject `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS server. The issue has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1. Prior to using a chart with Helm verify the `getHostByName` function is not being used in a template to disclose any information you do not want passed to DNS servers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25165", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nHelm\u00bbHelmVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.11.1cpe:2.3:a:helm:helm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-31  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-pwcw-6f5g-gxf8", "ref_desc": "getHostByName Function Information Disclosure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 helm/helm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/5abcf74227bfe8e5a3dbf105fe62e7b12deb58d2", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-pwcw-6f5g-gxf8 \u00b7 helm/helm@5abcf74 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
