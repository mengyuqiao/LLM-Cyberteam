{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25562", "Description": "DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In versions of DataHub prior to 0.8.45 Session cookies are only cleared on new sign-in events and not on logout events. Any authentication checks using the `AuthUtils.hasValidSessionCookie()` method could be bypassed by using a cookie from a logged out session, as a result any logged out session cookie may be accepted as valid and therefore lead to an authentication bypass to the system. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. This vulnerability was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is tracked as GHSL-2022-083.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25562", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDatahub Project\u00bbDatahubVersions  before (<) 0.8.45cpe:2.3:a:datahub_project:datahub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-02  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-23  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-14  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-17  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-01-11  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/aa146db611e3a4ca3aa17bb740783f789d4444d3/datahub-frontend/app/auth/AuthUtils.java#L78", "ref_desc": "datahub/AuthUtils.java at aa146db611e3a4ca3aa17bb740783f789d4444d3 \u00b7 datahub-project/datahub \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-3974-hxjh-m3jj", "ref_desc": "Failure to Invalidate Session on Logout (`GHSL-2022-083`) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 datahub-project/datahub \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
