{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22796", "Description": "A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Active Support <6.1.7.1 and <7.0.4.1. A specially crafted string passed to the underscore method can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22796", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nActivesupport Project\u00bbActivesupport\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 6.1.7.1cpe:2.3:a:activesupport_project:activesupport:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nActivesupport Project\u00bbActivesupport\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.4.1cpe:2.3:a:activesupport_project:activesupport:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-30  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-16  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-01  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-07-22  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-13  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-16  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-02-09  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-01-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5372", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5372-1 railsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dKyFLWbq6Nbnn1IU8VxThdeH0F8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240202-0009/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-22796 Ruby on Rails Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2023-22796-possible-redos-based-dos-vulnerability-in-active-supports-underscore/82116", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2023-22796] Possible ReDoS based DoS vulnerability in Active Support's underscore - Security Announcements - Ruby on Rails DiscussionsPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
