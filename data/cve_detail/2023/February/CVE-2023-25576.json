{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25576", "Description": "@fastify/multipart is a Fastify plugin to parse the multipart content-type. Prior to versions 7.4.1 and 6.0.1, @fastify/multipart may experience denial of service due to a number of situations in which an unlimited number of parts are accepted. This includes the multipart body parser accepting an unlimited number of file parts, the multipart body parser accepting an unlimited number of field parts, and the multipart body parser accepting an unlimited number of empty parts as field parts. This is fixed in v7.4.1 (for Fastify v4.x) and v6.0.1 (for Fastify v3.x). There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25576", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFastify\u00bbFastify-multipart\u00bbForFastifyVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.4.1cpe:2.3:a:fastify:fastify-multipart:*:*:*:*:*:fastify:*:*Matching versions\nFastify\u00bbFastify-multipart\u00bbForFastifyVersions  before (<) 6.0.1cpe:2.3:a:fastify:fastify-multipart:*:*:*:*:*:fastify:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.20%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-06  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-07-27  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-05-21  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-03-18  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-02-21  0.07%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 8  2024-01-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-multipart/security/advisories/GHSA-hpp2-2cr5-pf6g", "ref_desc": "DoS due to unlimited number of parts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 fastify/fastify-multipart \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1816195", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-multipart/commit/85be81bedf5b29cfd9fe3efc30fb5a17173c1297", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hpp2-2cr5-pf6g \u00b7 fastify/fastify-multipart@85be81b \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-multipart/releases/tag/v6.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release v6.0.1 \u00b7 fastify/fastify-multipart \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-multipart/releases/tag/v7.4.1", "ref_desc": "Release v7.4.1 \u00b7 fastify/fastify-multipart \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
