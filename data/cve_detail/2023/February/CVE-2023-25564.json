{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25564", "Description": "GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, memory corruption can be triggered when decoding UTF16 strings. The variable `outlen` was not initialized and could cause writing a zero to an arbitrary place in memory if `ntlm_str_convert()` were to fail, which would leave `outlen` uninitialized. This can lead to a denial of service if the write hits unmapped memory or randomly corrupts a byte in the application memory space. This vulnerability can trigger an out-of-bounds write, leading to memory corruption. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25564", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGss-ntlmssp Project\u00bbGss-ntlmsspVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:gss-ntlmssp_project:gss-ntlmssp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-06  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-07-27  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-01-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-r85x-q5px-9xfq", "ref_desc": "Memory corruption when decoding UTF16 strings \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gssapi/gss-ntlmssp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/c753000eb31835c0664e528fbc99378ae0cbe950", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-013: Memory corruption decoding UTF16 \u00b7 gssapi/gss-ntlmssp@c753000 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "ref_desc": "Release Patched several CVEs reported by GitHub Security Lab \u00b7 gssapi/gss-ntlmssp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XaCcVduLm3oOPPwU-leQXU2uaBQ.html"}]}
