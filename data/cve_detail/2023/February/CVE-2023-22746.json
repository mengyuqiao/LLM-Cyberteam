{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22746", "Description": "CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data portals. When creating a new container based on one of the Docker images listed below, the same secret key was being used by default. If the users didn't set a custom value via environment variables in the `.env` file, that key was shared across different CKAN instances, making it easy to forge authentication requests. Users overriding the default secret key in their own `.env` file are not affected by this issue. Note that the legacy images (ckan/ckan) located in the main CKAN repo are not affected by this issue. The affected images are ckan/ckan-docker, (ckan/ckan-base images), okfn/docker-ckan (openknowledge/ckan-base and openknowledge/ckan-dev images) keitaroinc/docker-ckan (keitaro/ckan images).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22746", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOkfn\u00bbCkanVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.7cpe:2.3:a:okfn:ckan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOkfn\u00bbCkanVersions  before (<) 2.8.12cpe:2.3:a:okfn:ckan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.13%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-16  0.13%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-07  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-10  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-01-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-344 Use of Invariant Value in Dynamically Changing Context", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/344/Use-of-Invariant-Value-in-Dynamically-Changing-Context.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/4c22c135fa486afa13855d1cdb9765eaf418d2aa", "ref_desc": "Perform checks on provided id when creating user \u00b7 ckan/ckan@4c22c13 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/44af0f0a148fcc0e0fbcf02fe69b7db13459a84b", "ref_desc": "Perform checks on provided id when creating user \u00b7 ckan/ckan@44af0f0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-pr8j-v4c8-h62x", "ref_desc": "Session secret shared across instances using Docker images \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ckan/ckan \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
