{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0814", "Description": "The Profile Builder \u2013 User Profile & User Registration Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure via the [user_meta] shortcode in versions up to, and including 3.9.0. This is due to insufficient restriction on sensitive user meta values that can be called via that shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions, and above to retrieve sensitive user meta that can be used to gain access to a high privileged user account. This does require the Usermeta shortcode be enabled to be exploited.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0814", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCozmoslabs\u00bbProfile Builder\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.9.0cpe:2.3:a:cozmoslabs:profile_builder:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-05  0.07%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-09-06  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-08-24  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 5  2024-08-09  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-07-27  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 7  2024-02-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-01-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2864329%40profile-builder&new=2864329%40profile-builder&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "ref_desc": "Changeset 2864329 for profile-builder \u2013 WordPress Plugin RepositoryPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qW6KZBVb8BMheq_skMa6VtNin_o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bbedad66-a5a6-4fb5-b03e-0ecf9fbef19a", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
