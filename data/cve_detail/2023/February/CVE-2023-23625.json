{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23625", "Description": "go-unixfs is an implementation of a unix-like filesystem on top of an ipld merkledag. Trying to read malformed HAMT sharded directories can cause panics and virtual memory leaks. If you are reading untrusted user input, an attacker can then trigger a panic. This is caused by bogus `fanout` parameter in the HAMT directory nodes. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.4.3 to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should not feed untrusted user data to the decoding functions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23625", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nProtocol\u00bbGo-unixfs\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 0.4.3cpe:2.3:a:protocol:go-unixfs:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-01  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-22  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-16  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfs/commit/467d139a640ecee4f2e74643dafcc58bb3b54175", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-q264-w97q-q778 \u00b7 ipfs/go-unixfs@467d139 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfs/security/advisories/GHSA-q264-w97q-q778", "ref_desc": "DOS HAMT Decoding Panics \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ipfs/go-unixfs \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
