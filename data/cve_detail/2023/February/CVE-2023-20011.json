{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20011", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco Cloud Network Controller, formerly Cisco Cloud APIC, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20011", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbApplication Policy Infrastructure ControllerVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.0\\(2h\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_policy_infrastructure_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbApplication Policy Infrastructure ControllerVersions  from including (>=) 4.2\\(6\\)andbefore (<) 5.2\\(7g\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:application_policy_infrastructure_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbCloud Network ControllerVersions  from including (>=) 4.2\\(6\\)andbefore (<) 25.0\\(5\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:cloud_network_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-15  0.09%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2024-08-05  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-27  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-01-24  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.98 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-capic-csrfv-DMx6KSwV", "ref_desc": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller and Cisco Cloud Network Controller Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
