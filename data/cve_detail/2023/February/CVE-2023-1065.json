{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-1065", "Description": "This vulnerability in the Snyk Kubernetes Monitor can result in irrelevant data being posted to a Snyk Organization, which could in turn obfuscate other, relevant, security issues. It does not expose the user of the integration to any direct security risk and no user data can be leaked. To exploit the vulnerability the attacker does not need to be authenticated to Snyk but does need to know the target's Integration ID (which may or may not be the same as the Organization ID, although this is an unpredictable UUID in either case).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1065", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nSnyk\u00bbKubernetes MonitorVersions  before (<) 2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:snyk:kubernetes_monitor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-01  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-06  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 \n 7  2023-03-02  0.89%  1.02%  +0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://snyk.io/blog/api-auth-vuln-snyk-kubernetes-cve-2023-1065/", "ref_desc": "403 ForbiddenVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snyk/kubernetes-monitor/pull/1275", "ref_desc": "RELEASE V2 by kat1906 \u00b7 Pull Request #1275 \u00b7 snyk/kubernetes-monitor \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snyk/kubernetes-monitor", "ref_desc": "GitHub - snyk/kubernetes-monitor: Use Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes workloadsProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/snyk/kubernetes-monitor/commit/5b9a7821680bbfb6c4a900ab05d898ce2b2cc157", "ref_desc": "feat: call authenticated snyk API endpoints with token \u00b7 snyk/kubernetes-monitor@5b9a782 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
