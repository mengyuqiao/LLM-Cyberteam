{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25154", "Description": "Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.5.0 the link to the instance to the sender that appears when viewing a user or note received through ActivityPub is not properly validated, so by inserting a URL with a javascript scheme an attacker may execute JavaScript code in the context of the recipient. This issue has been fixed in version 13.5.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not \"view on remote\" for untrusted instances.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25154", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMisskey\u00bbMisskeyVersions  before (<) 13.5.0cpe:2.3:a:misskey:misskey:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-14  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-pfp5-r48x-fg25", "ref_desc": "XSS of ActivityPub URI \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 misskey-dev/misskey \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
