{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25719", "Description": "ConnectWise Control before 22.9.10032 (formerly known as ScreenConnect) fails to validate user-supplied parameters such as the Bin/ConnectWiseControl.Client.exe h parameter. This results in reflected data and injection of malicious code into a downloaded executable. The executable can be used to execute malicious queries or as a denial-of-service vector. NOTE: this CVE Record is only about the parameters, such as the h parameter (this CVE Record is not about the separate issue of signed executable files that are supposed to have unique configurations across customers' installations).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25719", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nConnectwise\u00bbControlVersions  before (<) 22.9.10032cpe:2.3:a:connectwise:control:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-04  0.41%  0.49%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-09-20  0.33%  0.41%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-09-05  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-07-26  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-03-17  0.17%  0.27%  +0.10 \n 6  2024-03-04  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-02-20  0.07%  0.12%  +0.06 \n 8  2024-01-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 \n 10  2023-03-06  0.89%  1.02%  +0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cybir.com/2022/cve/hijacking-connectwise-control-and-ddos/", "ref_desc": "Hijacking Connectwise Control & Screen Connect (v.22.9.10032, MULTIPLE) for Fun and Profit - From DDoS to Multi-OS RCE! - CYBIR - Cyber Security, Incident Response, & Digital ForensicsExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.connectwise.com", "ref_desc": "MSP Technology | IT Management Software | ConnectWiseProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/niVSEvCN7eOk2CBIhnaytXIl9Gc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.connectwise.com/blog/cybersecurity/the-importance-of-responsible-security-disclosures", "ref_desc": "The Importance of Responsible Security DisclosuresCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o-8WpK87qnHYHB56MYSCbyylWfg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.huntress.com/blog/clearing-the-air-overblown-claims-of-vulnerabilities-exploits-severity", "ref_desc": "Clearing the Air: Overblown Claims of Vulnerabilities, Exploits & SeverityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oeY6-aP3WpDEa5pdfCnsNcqNofQ.html"}]}
