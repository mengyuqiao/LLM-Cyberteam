{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25577", "Description": "Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers. Version 2.2.3 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25577", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPalletsprojects\u00bbWerkzeugVersions  before (<) 2.2.3cpe:2.3:a:palletsprojects:werkzeug:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-06  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-07-27  0.15%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-05-21  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-18  0.11%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-02-21  0.06%  0.11%  +0.06 \n 8  2023-08-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323 \u00b7 pallets/werkzeug@517cac5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3", "ref_desc": "Release 2.2.3 \u00b7 pallets/werkzeug \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KcS8CiKmX9qLzcjktNfEQIyZbZA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323", "ref_desc": "high resource usage when parsing multipart form data with many fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pallets/werkzeug \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5470", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5470-1 python-werkzeugCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QT45Ln_QSYP-iBwllPi90B26NJg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0003/", "ref_desc": "February 2023 Werkzeug Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RSq-DpqiJt9o2h3THL7bSj1y5XY.html"}]}
