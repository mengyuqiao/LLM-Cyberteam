{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25139", "Description": "sprintf in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.37 has a buffer overflow (out-of-bounds write) in some situations with a correct buffer size. This is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated string representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size required to represent that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with padding to 13) overflows by two bytes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25139", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbGlibc\u00bbVersion:2.37cpe:2.3:a:gnu:glibc:2.37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-24  0.19%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.15%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-26  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-07-16  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-07  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-10  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-01-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 \n 10  2023-03-03  0.89%  0.95%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230302-0010/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-25139 GNU C Library (glibc) Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30068", "ref_desc": "30068 \u2013 incorrect printf output for integers with thousands separator and width fieldExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/02/10/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-25139: glibc-2.37 sprintf buffer overflow", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
