{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24827", "Description": "syft is a a CLI tool and Go library for generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from container images and filesystems. A password disclosure flaw was found in Syft versions v0.69.0 and v0.69.1. This flaw leaks the password stored in the SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment variable. The `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the `syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`) during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. This vulnerability affects users running syft that have the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials (regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are not affected by this issue. The credentials are leaked in two ways: in the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which is any log level >= `DEBUG`) and in the attestation or SBOM only when the `syft-json` format is used. Note that as of v0.69.0 any generated attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way `cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation payload uploaded to the OCI registry. This issue has been patched in commit `9995950c70` and has been released as v0.70.0. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24827", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nAnchore\u00bbSyft\u00bbVersion:0.69.0cpe:2.3:a:anchore:syft:0.69.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAnchore\u00bbSyft\u00bbVersion:0.69.1cpe:2.3:a:anchore:syft:0.69.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-30  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-20  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-11  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-14  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anchore/syft/commit/9995950c70e849f9921919faffbfcf46401f71f3", "ref_desc": "fix: update config struct to not decode password/key (#1538) \u00b7 anchore/syft@9995950 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anchore/syft/security/advisories/GHSA-jp7v-3587-2956", "ref_desc": "Credential disclosure in syft when SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment variable set \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anchore/syft \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
