{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23933", "Description": "OpenSearch Anomaly Detection identifies atypical data and receives automatic notifications. There is an issue with the application of document and field level restrictions in the Anomaly Detection plugin, where users with the Anomaly Detector role can read aggregated numerical data (e.g. averages, sums) of fields that are otherwise restricted to them. This issue only affects authenticated users who were previously granted read access to the indexes containing the restricted fields. This issue has been patched in versions 1.3.8 and 2.6.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23933", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.3.8cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection/security/advisories/GHSA-47qw-jwpx-pp4c", "ref_desc": "Issue in Anomaly Detection with document and field level rules in numerical feature aggregations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/anomaly-detection \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
