{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22855", "Description": "Kardex Mlog MCC 5.7.12+0-a203c2a213-master allows remote code execution. It spawns a web interface listening on port 8088. A user-controllable path is handed to a path-concatenation method (Path.Combine from .NET) without proper sanitisation. This yields the possibility of including local files, as well as remote files on SMB shares. If one provides a file with the extension .t4, it is rendered with the .NET templating engine mono/t4, which can execute code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22855", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nKardex\u00bbKardex Control Center\u00bbVersion:5.7.12+0-a203c2a213-mastercpe:2.3:a:kardex:kardex_control_center:5.7.12\\+0-a203c2a213-master:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "24.88% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  22.57%  24.88%  +2.31 \n 2  2024-11-04  17.28%  22.57%  +5.29 \n 3  2024-10-06  9.99%  17.28%  +7.29 \n 4  2024-09-22  7.96%  9.99%  +2.03 \n 5  2024-09-07  7.87%  7.96%  +0.09 \n 6  2024-08-25  5.90%  7.87%  +1.97 \n 7  2024-08-10  4.36%  5.90%  +1.53 \n 8  2024-07-28  4.16%  4.36%  +0.21 \n 9  2024-05-22  3.54%  4.16%  +0.62 \n 10  2024-03-19  3.22%  3.54%  +0.31 \n 11  2024-02-22  1.42%  3.22%  +1.80 \n 12  2024-01-16  1.68%  1.42%  -0.25 \n 13  2023-07-15  2.68%  1.68%  -1.00 \n 14  2023-07-08  6.30%  2.68%  -3.63 \n 15  2023-05-25  6.11%  6.30%  +0.20 \n 16  2023-05-08  4.40%  6.11%  +1.70 \n 17  2023-04-11  2.60%  4.40%  +1.81 \n 18  2023-04-06  1.40%  2.60%  +1.19 \n 19  2023-03-07  46.46%  1.40%  -45.05 \n 20  2023-02-25  12.72%  46.46%  +33.74 \n 21  2023-02-18  5.01%  12.72%  +7.70 \n 22  2023-02-17  2.72%  5.01%  +2.29 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/patrickhener/CVE-2023-22855/blob/main/advisory/advisory.md", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-22855/advisory.md at main \u00b7 patrickhener/CVE-2023-22855 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171689/Kardex-Mlog-MCC-5.7.12-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Kardex Mlog MCC 5.7.12 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51239", "ref_desc": "Kardex Mlog MCC 5.7.12 - RCE (Remote Code Execution) - Windows remote Exploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171046/Kardex-Mlog-MCC-5.7.12-0-a203c2a213-master-File-Inclusion-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Kardex Mlog MCC 5.7.12+0-a203c2a213-master File Inclusion / Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Feb/10", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Remote Code Execution in Kardex MLOGExploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
