{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25162", "Description": "Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Nextcloud Server prior to 24.0.8 and 23.0.12 and Nextcloud Enterprise server prior to 24.0.8 and 23.0.12 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Attackers can leverage enclosed alphanumeric payloads to bypass IP filters and gain SSRF, which would allow an attacker to read crucial metadata if the server is hosted on the AWS platform. Nextcloud Server 24.0.8 and 23.0.2 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 24.0.8 and 23.0.12 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25162", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.8cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 23.0.12cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-05  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-26  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-20  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/34160", "ref_desc": "Detect weird local ips by come-nc \u00b7 Pull Request #34160 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-mqrx-grp7-244m", "ref_desc": "SSRF via filter bypass due to lax checking on IPs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1702864", "ref_desc": "HackerOneExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
