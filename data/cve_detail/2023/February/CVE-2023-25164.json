{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25164", "Description": "Tinacms is a Git-backed headless content management system with support for visual editing. Sites being built with @tinacms/cli >= 1.0.0 && < 1.0.9 which store sensitive values in the process.env variable are impacted. These values will be added in plaintext to the index.js file. If you're on a version prior to 1.0.0 this vulnerability does not affect you. If you are affected and your Tina-enabled website has sensitive credentials stored as environment variables (eg. Algolia API keys) you should rotate those keys immediately. This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli@1.0.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25164", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTina\u00bbTinacms\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.0.9cpe:2.3:a:tina:tinacms:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-31  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-21  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-12  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-15  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-01-09  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/pull/3584", "ref_desc": "Only expose `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` and `TINA_PUBLIC_*` ENV vars by logan-anderson \u00b7 Pull Request #3584 \u00b7 tinacms/tinacms \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/security/advisories/GHSA-pc2q-jcxq-rjrr", "ref_desc": "Sensitive Information leak via Script File in TinaCMS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tinacms/tinacms \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
