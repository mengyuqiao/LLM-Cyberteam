{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25812", "Description": "Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Affected versions do not correctly honor a `Deny` policy on ByPassGoverance. Ideally, minio should return \"Access Denied\" to all users attempting to DELETE a versionId with the special header `X-Amz-Bypass-Governance-Retention: true`. However, this was not honored instead the request will be honored and an object under governance would be incorrectly deleted. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25812", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinioVersions  from including (>=) 2020-04-10t03-34-42zandbefore (<) 2023-02-17t17-52-43zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-12  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-09-28  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-13  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-28  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-01-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-12-29  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/16635", "ref_desc": "fix: evaluate BypassGov policy action in deletion correctly by vadmeste \u00b7 Pull Request #16635 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-c8fc-mjj8-fc63", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation allowing DELETE on resources on object locked buckets under Governance mode \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/a7188bc9d0f0a5ae05aaf1b8126bcd3cb3fdc485", "ref_desc": "fix: evaluate BypassGov policy action in deletion correctly (#16635) \u00b7 minio/minio@a7188bc \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
