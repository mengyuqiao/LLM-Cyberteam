{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25823", "Description": "Gradio is an open-source Python library to build machine learning and data science demos and web applications. Versions prior to 3.13.1 contain Use of Hard-coded Credentials. When using Gradio's share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`), a private SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides. This issue is patched in version 3.13.1, however, users are recommended to update to 3.19.1 or later where the FRP solution has been properly tested.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25823", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGradio Project\u00bbGradio\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 3.13.1cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-15  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-05  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-27  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-01  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-01-24  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-08  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-3x5j-9vwr-8rr5", "ref_desc": "Update share links to use FRP instead of SSH tunneling \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradio-app/gradio \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
