{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26036", "Description": "ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application for Linux which supports IP, USB and Analog cameras. Versions prior to 1.36.33 and 1.37.33 contain a Local File Inclusion (Untrusted Search Path) vulnerability via /web/index.php. By controlling $view, any local file ending in .php can be executed. This is supposed to be mitigated by calling detaintPath, however dentaintPath does not properly sandbox the path. This can be exploited by constructing paths like \"..././\", which get replaced by \"../\". This issue is patched in versions 1.36.33 and 1.37.33.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26036", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nZoneminder\u00bbZoneminderVersions  before (<) 1.36.33cpe:2.3:a:zoneminder:zoneminder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZoneminder\u00bbZoneminderVersions  from including (>=) 1.37.00andbefore (<) 1.37.33cpe:2.3:a:zoneminder:zoneminder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-07  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-29  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-03-03  0.10%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-01-25  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-08  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/security/advisories/GHSA-h5m9-6jjc-cgmw", "ref_desc": "Local File Inclusion vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ZoneMinder/zoneminder \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
