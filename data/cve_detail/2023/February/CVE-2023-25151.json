{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25151", "Description": "opentelemetry-go-contrib is a collection of extensions for OpenTelemetry-Go. The v0.38.0 release of `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` uses the `httpconv.ServerRequest` function to annotate metric measurements for the `http.server.request_content_length`, `http.server.response_content_length`, and `http.server.duration` instruments. The `ServerRequest` function sets the `http.target` attribute value to be the whole request URI (including the query string)[^1]. The metric instruments do not \"forget\" previous measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used, this means the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly correlated with the unique URIs handled. If the query string is constantly random, this will result in a constant increase in memory allocation that can be used in a denial-of-service attack. This issue has been addressed in version 0.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25151", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbOpentelemetry-go Contrib\u00bbVersion:0.38.0ForOpentelemetry-gocpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:opentelemetry-go_contrib:0.38.0:*:*:*:*:opentelemetry-go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-31  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-21  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-12  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-15  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/v1.12.0/semconv/internal/v2/http.go#L159", "ref_desc": "opentelemetry-go/http.go at v1.12.0 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go \u00b7 GitHubVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LHZoHBAhT7r60C6C9h7EJsyg8NY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh", "ref_desc": "DoS vulnerability for high cardinality metrics in otelhttp and otelbeego \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OsXQlUxoHVPvwh_OLAhmymS9Cv4.html"}]}
