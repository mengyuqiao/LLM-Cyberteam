{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23626", "Description": "go-bitfield is a simple bitfield package for the go language aiming to be more performant that the standard library. When feeding untrusted user input into the size parameter of `NewBitfield` and `FromBytes` functions, an attacker can trigger `panic`s. This happen when the `size` is a not a multiple of `8` or is negative. There were already a note in the `NewBitfield` documentation, however known users of this package are subject to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `size` is a multiple of 8 before calling `NewBitfield` or `FromBytes`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23626", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nProtocol\u00bbGo-bitfield\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:protocol:go-bitfield:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-01  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-22  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-16  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r", "ref_desc": "DOS when feeding malphormed sizes arguments \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ipfs/go-bitfield \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/commit/5e1d256fe043fc4163343ccca83862c69c52e579", "ref_desc": "refactor: return errors instead of panics \u00b7 ipfs/go-bitfield@5e1d256 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
