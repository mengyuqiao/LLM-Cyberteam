{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-48338", "Description": "An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. In ruby-mode.el, the ruby-find-library-file function has a local command injection vulnerability. The ruby-find-library-file function is an interactive function, and bound to C-c C-f. Inside the function, the external command gem is called through shell-command-to-string, but the feature-name parameters are not escaped. Thus, malicious Ruby source files may cause commands to be executed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48338", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbEmacsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 28.2cpe:2.3:a:gnu:emacs:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.04%  -0.96 \n 2  2023-03-04  2.06%  1.01%  -1.05 \n 3  2023-03-03  1.01%  2.06%  +1.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FLPQ4K6H2S5TY3L5UDN4K4B3L5RQJYQ6/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: emacs-28.3-0.rc1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fwSiIxPNNN_ICWAhKsnmjENbpK0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U6HDBUQNAH2WL4MHWCTUZLN7NGF7CHTK/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: emacs-28.3-0.rc1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jmBIeqjDN822SvVaKyLNmqorRO0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=9a3b08061feea14d6f37685ca1ab8801758bfd1c", "ref_desc": "emacs.git - Emacs source repositoryPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5360", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VV1K573JU2ISaXtZJvAkJhGoFLo.html"}]}
