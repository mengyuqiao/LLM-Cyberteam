{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25813", "Description": "Sequelize is a Node.js ORM tool. In versions prior to 6.19.1 a SQL injection exploit exists related to replacements. Parameters which are passed through replacements are not properly escaped which can lead to arbitrary SQL injection depending on the specific queries in use. The issue has been fixed in Sequelize 6.19.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `replacements` and the `where` option in the same query.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25813", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nSequelizejs\u00bbSequelize\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 6.19.1cpe:2.3:a:sequelizejs:sequelize:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-14  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 2  2024-08-04  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-26  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-29  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-01-23  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/security/advisories/GHSA-wrh9-cjv3-2hpw", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection via replacements \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sequelize/sequelize \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/releases/tag/v6.19.1", "ref_desc": "Release v6.19.1 \u00b7 sequelize/sequelize \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/commit/ccaa3996047fe00048d5993ab2dd43ebadd4f78b", "ref_desc": "fix: do not replace `:replacements` inside of strings (#14472) \u00b7 sequelize/sequelize@ccaa399 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/14519", "ref_desc": "PSA: Upgrade to Sequelize >= 6.19.2 & Our recent breaking change in v6 \u00b7 Issue #14519 \u00b7 sequelize/sequelize \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
