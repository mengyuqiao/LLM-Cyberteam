{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25563", "Description": "GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, multiple out-of-bounds reads when decoding NTLM fields can trigger a denial of service. A 32-bit integer overflow condition can lead to incorrect checks of consistency of length of internal buffers. Although most applications will error out before accepting a singe input buffer of 4GB in length this could theoretically happen. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point if the application allows tokens greater than 4GB in length. This can lead to a large, up to 65KB, out-of-bounds read which could cause a denial-of-service if it reads from unmapped memory. Version 1.2.0 contains a patch for the out-of-bounds reads.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25563", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGss-ntlmssp Project\u00bbGss-ntlmsspVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:gss-ntlmssp_project:gss-ntlmssp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-06  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-07-27  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-01-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-jjjx-5qf7-9mgf", "ref_desc": "Multiple out-of-bounds read when decoding NTLM fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gssapi/gss-ntlmssp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/97c62c6167299028d80765080e74d91dfc99efbd", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read in multiple decode functions \u00b7 gssapi/gss-ntlmssp@97c62c6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "ref_desc": "Release Patched several CVEs reported by GitHub Security Lab \u00b7 gssapi/gss-ntlmssp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XaCcVduLm3oOPPwU-leQXU2uaBQ.html"}]}
