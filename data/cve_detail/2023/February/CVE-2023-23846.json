{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23846", "Description": "Due to insufficient length validation in the Open5GS GTP library versions prior to versions 2.4.13 and 2.5.7, when parsing extension headers in GPRS tunneling protocol (GPTv1-U) messages, a protocol payload with any extension header length set to zero causes an infinite loop. The affected process becomes immediately unresponsive, resulting in denial of service and excessive resource consumption.
