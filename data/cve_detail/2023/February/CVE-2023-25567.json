{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25567", "Description": "GSS-NTLMSSP, a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication, has an out-of-bounds read when decoding target information prior to version 1.2.0. The length of the `av_pair` is not checked properly for two of the elements which can trigger an out-of-bound read. The out-of-bounds read can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point and could cause a denial-of-service if the memory is unmapped. The issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25567", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGss-ntlmssp Project\u00bbGss-ntlmsspVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:gss-ntlmssp_project:gss-ntlmssp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-06  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-07-27  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-18  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-01-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/025fbb756d44ffee8f847db4222ed6aa4bd1fbe4", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-011: Out-of-bounds read when decoding \u00b7 gssapi/gss-ntlmssp@025fbb7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-24pf-6prf-24ch", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read when decoding target information \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gssapi/gss-ntlmssp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "ref_desc": "Release Patched several CVEs reported by GitHub Security Lab \u00b7 gssapi/gss-ntlmssp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/XaCcVduLm3oOPPwU-leQXU2uaBQ.html"}]}
