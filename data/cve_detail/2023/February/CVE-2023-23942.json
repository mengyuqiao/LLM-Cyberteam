{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23942", "Description": "The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from a Nextcloud Server with your computer. Versions prior to 3.6.3 are missing sanitisation on qml labels which are used for basic HTML elements such as `strong`, `em` and `head` lines in the UI of the desktop client. The lack of sanitisation may allow for javascript injection. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop Client is upgraded to 3.6.3. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23942", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbDesktopVersions  before (<) 3.6.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-19  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-10  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 \n 6  2023-02-15  0.89%  0.95%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-64qc-vf6v-8xgg", "ref_desc": "Self reflected HTML injection in Desktop client \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/5233", "ref_desc": "Make use of plain text-enforcing qml labels by claucambra \u00b7 Pull Request #5233 \u00b7 nextcloud/desktop \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/1788598", "ref_desc": "HackerOnePermissions Required;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
