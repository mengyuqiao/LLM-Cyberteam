{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25561", "Description": "DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In the event a system is using Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) authentication and that system is given a configuration which contains an error, the authentication for the system will fail open and allow an attacker to login using any username and password. The reason for this is that while an error is thrown in the `authenticateJaasUser` method it is swallowed without propagating the error. As a result of this issue unauthenticated users may gain access to the system. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. This vulnerability was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is tracked as GHSL-2022-081.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25561", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDatahub Project\u00bbDatahubVersions  before (<) 0.8.45cpe:2.3:a:datahub_project:datahub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-23  0.16%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-14  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-17  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-01-11  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/fdf4e48495f083314f59c414bcc7c2601633a2b8/datahub-frontend/app/security/AuthenticationManager.java#L26", "ref_desc": "datahub/AuthenticationManager.java at fdf4e48495f083314f59c414bcc7c2601633a2b8 \u00b7 datahub-project/datahub \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-7wc6-p6c4-522c", "ref_desc": "Login fail open on JAAS misconfiguration (`GHSL-2022-081`) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 datahub-project/datahub \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
