{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22743", "Description": "Git for Windows is the Windows port of the revision control system Git. Prior to Git for Windows version 2.39.2, by carefully crafting DLL and putting into a subdirectory of a specific name living next to the Git for Windows installer, Windows can be tricked into side-loading said DLL. This potentially allows users with local write access to place malicious payloads in a location where automated upgrades might run the Git for Windows installer with elevation. Version 2.39.2 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Never leave untrusted files in the Downloads folder or its sub-folders before executing the Git for Windows installer, or move the installer into a different directory before executing it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22743", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nGit For Windows Project\u00bbGit For WindowsVersions  before (<) 2.39.2cpe:2.3:a:git_for_windows_project:git_for_windows:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.04%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/controls/cookbook-overview?redirectedfrom=MSDN#using-comctl32dll-version-6-in-an-application-that-uses-only-standard-extensions", "ref_desc": "Enabling Visual Styles - Win32 apps | Microsoft LearnPatch;Technical Description;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/about-side-by-side-assemblies-", "ref_desc": "About Side-by-Side Assemblies - Win32 apps | Microsoft LearnPatch;Technical Description;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.39.2.windows.1", "ref_desc": "Release Git for Windows 2.39.2 \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eP3u4ixf2cxKTCDOKxnXh2bnPqE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/", "ref_desc": "Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading, Sub-technique T1574.002 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK\u00aeTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-p2x9-prp4-8gvq", "ref_desc": "Git for Windows' installer is susceptible to DLL side loading attacks \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gf48-x3vr-j5c3", "ref_desc": "Git for Windows' uninstaller vulnerable to DLL hijacking when run under the SYSTEM user account \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 git-for-windows/git \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
