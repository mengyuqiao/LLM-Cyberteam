{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-48308", "Description": "It was discovered that the sls-logging was not verifying hostnames in TLS certificates due to a misuse of the javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory API. A malicious attacker in a privileged network position could abuse this to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. A successful man-in-the-middle attack would allow them to intercept, read, or modify network communications to and from the affected service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48308", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPalantir\u00bbSls-logging\u00bbForPalantirVersions  before (<) 9.51.0cpe:2.3:a:palantir:sls-logging:*:*:*:*:*:palantir:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-297 Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/297/Improper-Validation-of-Certificate-with-Host-Mismatch.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/palantir/security-bulletins/blob/main/PLTRSEC-2022-14.md", "ref_desc": "security-bulletins/PLTRSEC-2022-14.md at main \u00b7 palantir/security-bulletins \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
