{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24815", "Description": "Vert.x-Web is a set of building blocks for building web applications in the java programming language. When running vertx web applications that serve files using `StaticHandler` on Windows Operating Systems and Windows File Systems, if the mount point is a wildcard (`*`) then an attacker can exfiltrate any class path resource. When computing the relative path to locate the resource, in case of wildcards, the code: `return \"/\" + rest;` from `Utils.java` returns the user input (without validation) as the segment to lookup. Even though checks are performed to avoid escaping the sandbox, given that the input was not sanitized `\\` are not properly handled and an attacker can build a path that is valid within the classpath. This issue only affects users deploying in windows environments and upgrading is the advised remediation path. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24815", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbVert.x-webVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.3.8cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:vert.x-web:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-01  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-22  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-13  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-16  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-02-05  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-01-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 \n 8  2023-02-25  6.95%  0.95%  -5.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web/security/advisories/GHSA-53jx-vvf9-4x38", "ref_desc": "StaticHandler disclosure of classpath resources on Windows when mounted on a wildcard route \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vert-x3/vertx-web \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web/blob/62c0d66fa1c179ae6a4d57344631679a2b97e60f/vertx-web/src/main/java/io/vertx/ext/web/impl/Utils.java#L83", "ref_desc": "vertx-web/Utils.java at 62c0d66fa1c179ae6a4d57344631679a2b97e60f \u00b7 vert-x3/vertx-web \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web/commit/9e3a783b1d1a731055e9049078b1b1494ece9c15", "ref_desc": "Fix the webroot escape to classpath on windows \u00b7 vert-x3/vertx-web@9e3a783 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
