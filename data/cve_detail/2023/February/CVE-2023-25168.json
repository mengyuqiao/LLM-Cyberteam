{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25168", "Description": "Wings is Pterodactyl's server control plane. This vulnerability can be used to delete files and directories recursively on the host system. This vulnerability can be combined with `GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5` to overwrite files on the host system. In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing \"server\" allocated and controlled by Wings. This vulnerability has been resolved in version `v1.11.4` of Wings, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series in `v1.7.4`. Anyone running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to `v1.11.4` and anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.4`. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25168", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPterodactyl\u00bbWingsVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.0andbefore (<) 1.7.4cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPterodactyl\u00bbWings\u00bbVersion:1.11.1cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:1.11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPterodactyl\u00bbWings\u00bbVersion:1.11.2cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:1.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPterodactyl\u00bbWings\u00bbVersion:1.11.0cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:1.11.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPterodactyl\u00bbWings\u00bbVersion:1.11.3cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:1.11.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-29  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-15  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-31  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-15  0.06%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-01-09  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-66p8-j459-rq63", "ref_desc": "Improper Link Resolution allowing the deletion of files and directories on the host system \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5", "ref_desc": "UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following allowing the creation of files and directory structures on the host system \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings \u00b7 GitHubVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eo5UWL4TLp30JlvruMN7KuTz2Kc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/429ac62dba22997a278bc709df5ac00a5a25d83d", "ref_desc": "server(filesystem): Delete tweaks \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings@429ac62 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
