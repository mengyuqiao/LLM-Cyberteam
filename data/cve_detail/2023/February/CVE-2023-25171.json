{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25171", "Description": "Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, does not impose rate limits in versions prior to 12.0. This makes it easier to attempt denial-of-service attacks against the Password reset page. An attacker could potentially send a large number of emails if they know the email addresses of users in Kiwi TCMS. Additionally that may strain SMTP resources. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch. As potential workarounds, users may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS and/or configure rate limits on their email server when possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25171", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nKiwitcms\u00bbKiwi TcmsVersions  before (<) 12.0cpe:2.3:a:kiwitcms:kiwi_tcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.15%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-09-22  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-07  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 4  2024-07-28  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-19  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-02-22  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-01-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/02/15/kiwi-tcms-120/", "ref_desc": "Kiwi TCMS - Kiwi TCMS 12.0Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3TBlf5uLMkze37U8nVybAAPy2H4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-7j9h-3jxf-3vrf", "ref_desc": "Denial of service vulnerability on Password reset page \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/3b712cb6-3fa3-4f71-8562-7a7016c6262e", "ref_desc": "huntr: Page not foundPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/761305d04f5910ba14cc04d1255a8f1afdbb87f3", "ref_desc": "Show captcha on password reset form if enabled \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi@761305d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
