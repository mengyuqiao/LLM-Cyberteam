{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25718", "Description": "In ConnectWise Control through 22.9.10032 (formerly known as ScreenConnect), after an executable file is signed, additional instructions can be added without invalidating the signature, such as instructions that result in offering the end user a (different) attacker-controlled executable file. It is plausible that the end user may allow the download and execution of this file to proceed. There are ConnectWise Control configuration options that add mitigations. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2023-25719. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this purported vulnerability represents a \"fundamental lack of understanding of Authenticode code signing behavior.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25718", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nConnectwise\u00bbControlVersions  up to, including, (<=) 22.9.10032cpe:2.3:a:connectwise:control:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.34%  0.36%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-11-02  0.34%  0.34%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-04  0.23%  0.34%  +0.11 \n 4  2024-09-20  0.19%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-09-05  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-07-26  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-03-17  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-02-20  0.10%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 9  2024-01-14  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.51%  0.08%  -2.43 \n 11  2023-03-06  1.44%  2.51%  +1.07 \n 12  2023-02-24  2.49%  1.44%  -1.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cybir.com/2022/cve/connectwise-control-dns-spoofing-poc/", "ref_desc": "Proof Of Concept: Connectwise Control Screenconnect Signed Executable to Arbitrary Code Execution via ARP Poisoning / DNS Hijacking / Unsanitized Client Parameters or Host Headers with CVE-2020-3147 (Not Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.connectwise.com", "ref_desc": "MSP Technology | IT Management Software | ConnectWiseProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/niVSEvCN7eOk2CBIhnaytXIl9Gc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.connectwise.com/blog/cybersecurity/the-importance-of-responsible-security-disclosures", "ref_desc": "The Importance of Responsible Security DisclosuresCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o-8WpK87qnHYHB56MYSCbyylWfg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.huntress.com/blog/clearing-the-air-overblown-claims-of-vulnerabilities-exploits-severity", "ref_desc": "Clearing the Air: Overblown Claims of Vulnerabilities, Exploits & SeverityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/oeY6-aP3WpDEa5pdfCnsNcqNofQ.html"}]}
