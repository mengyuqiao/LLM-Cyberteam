{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22474", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the `x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version 5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22474", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.4.1cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-16  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2024-02-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-04  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/e016d813e083ce6828f9abce245d15b681a224d8", "ref_desc": "fix: The client IP address may be determined incorrectly in some case\u2026 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@e016d81 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-vm5r-c87r-pf6x", "ref_desc": "Server option `masterKeyIps` vulnerability to IP spoofing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
