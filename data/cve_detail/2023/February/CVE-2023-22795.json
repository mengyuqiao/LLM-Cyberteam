{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22795", "Description": "A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch <6.1.7.1 and <7.0.4.1 related to the If-None-Match header. A specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match header can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, when on a version of Ruby below 3.2.0. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22795", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:11.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRubyonrails\u00bbRailsVersions  before (<) 6.1.7.1cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Ruby-lang\u00bbRuby\nRubyonrails\u00bbRailsVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.4.1cpe:2.3:a:rubyonrails:rails:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Ruby-lang\u00bbRuby", "EPSS Score": "3.71% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-30  3.19%  3.71%  +0.52 \n 2  2024-09-16  2.77%  3.19%  +0.42 \n 3  2024-09-01  2.72%  2.77%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-07-22  1.94%  2.72%  +0.78 \n 5  2024-03-13  1.37%  1.94%  +0.56 \n 6  2024-02-16  0.77%  1.37%  +0.61 \n 7  2024-02-09  0.09%  0.77%  +0.68 \n 8  2024-01-10  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-12-30  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5372", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5372-1 railsThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/dKyFLWbq6Nbnn1IU8VxThdeH0F8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2023-22795-possible-redos-based-dos-vulnerability-in-action-dispatch/82118", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2023-22795] Possible ReDoS based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch - Security Announcements - Ruby on Rails DiscussionsPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240202-0010/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-22795 Ruby on Rails Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
