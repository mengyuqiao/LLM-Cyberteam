{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25149", "Description": "TimescaleDB, an open-source time-series SQL database, has a privilege escalation vulnerability in versions 2.8.0 through 2.9.2. During installation, TimescaleDB creates a telemetry job that is runs as the installation user. The queries run as part of the telemetry data collection were not run with a locked down `search_path`, allowing malicious users to create functions that would be executed by the telemetry job, leading to privilege escalation. In order to be able to take advantage of this vulnerability, a user would need to be able to create objects in a database and then get a superuser to install TimescaleDB into their database. When TimescaleDB is installed as trusted extension, non-superusers can install the extension without help from a superuser. Version 2.9.3 fixes this issue. As a mitigation, the `search_path` of the user running the telemetry job can be locked down to not include schemas writable by other users. The vulnerability is not exploitable on instances in Timescale Cloud and Managed Service for TimescaleDB due to additional security provisions in place on those platforms.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25149", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nTimescale\u00bbTimescaledbVersions  from including (>=) 2.8.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.9.2cpe:2.3:a:timescale:timescaledb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-06  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-07-27  0.18%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-21  0.08%  0.18%  +0.09 \n 6  2024-01-15  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-12-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/releases/tag/2.9.3", "ref_desc": "Release 2.9.3 (2023-02-06) \u00b7 timescale/timescaledb \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/pull/5259", "ref_desc": "Lock down search_path in SPI calls by svenklemm \u00b7 Pull Request #5259 \u00b7 timescale/timescaledb \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/security/advisories/GHSA-44jh-j22r-33wq", "ref_desc": "TimescaleDB 2.8.0 through 2.9.2 has incorrect access control \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 timescale/timescaledb \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
