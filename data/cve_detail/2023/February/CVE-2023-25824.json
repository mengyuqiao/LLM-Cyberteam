{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25824", "Description": "Mod_gnutls is a TLS module for Apache HTTPD based on GnuTLS. Versions from 0.9.0 to 0.12.0 (including) did not properly fail blocking read operations on TLS connections when the transport hit timeouts. Instead it entered an endless loop retrying the read operation, consuming CPU resources. This could be exploited for denial of service attacks. If trace level logging was enabled, it would also produce an excessive amount of log output during the loop, consuming disk space. The problem has been fixed in commit d7eec4e598158ab6a98bf505354e84352f9715ec, please update to version 0.12.1. There are no workarounds, users who cannot update should apply the errno fix detailed in the security advisory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25824", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMod Gnutls Project\u00bbMod GnutlsVersions  from including (>=) 0.9.0andbefore (<) 0.12.1cpe:2.3:a:mod_gnutls_project:mod_gnutls:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-14  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-30  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-08-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-27  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-03-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/airtower-luna/mod_gnutls/commit/d7eec4e598158ab6a98bf505354e84352f9715ec", "ref_desc": "Fix loop in blocking read on transport timeout \u00b7 airtower-luna/mod_gnutls@d7eec4e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=942737#25", "ref_desc": "#942737 - libapache2-mod-gnutls: mod_gnutls consumes 100% cpu - Debian Bug report logsExploit;Issue Tracking;Mailing List;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/airtower-luna/mod_gnutls/security/advisories/GHSA-6cfv-fvgm-7pc8", "ref_desc": "Infinite Loop on request read timeout in mod_gnutls \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 airtower-luna/mod_gnutls \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
