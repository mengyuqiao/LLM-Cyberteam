{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25156", "Description": "Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, does not impose rate limits in versions prior to 12.0. This makes it easier to attempt brute-force attacks against the login page. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch. As a workaround, users may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25156", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKiwitcms\u00bbKiwi TcmsVersions  before (<) 12.0cpe:2.3:a:kiwitcms:kiwi_tcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-09-22  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-07  0.19%  0.18%  0.00 \n 4  2024-07-28  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-03-19  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-02-22  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-01-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.07%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/02/15/kiwi-tcms-120/", "ref_desc": "Kiwi TCMS - Kiwi TCMS 12.0Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/3TBlf5uLMkze37U8nVybAAPy2H4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-7968-h4m4-ghm9", "ref_desc": "No protection against brute-force attacks on login page \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/2b1a9be9-45e9-490b-8de0-26a492e79795/", "ref_desc": "huntr: Page not foundPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/0ed213fa0ddb7a6dc77e3c3b99e8fc90ccdaf46f", "ref_desc": "Rate limit everything under /accounts/ \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi@0ed213f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
