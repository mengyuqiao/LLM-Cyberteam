{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0401", "Description": "A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being\nverified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash\nalgorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but\nthe implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest\ninitialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return\nvalue from the initialization function which later leads to invalid\nusage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.\n\nThe unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS\nenabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading\nthe legacy provider.\n\nPKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the\ntime stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does\nnot call these functions however third party applications would be\naffected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted\ndata.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0401", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenssl\u00bbOpensslVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.0.7cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nStormshield\u00bbStormshield Management CenterVersions  before (<) 3.3.3cpe:2.3:a:stormshield:stormshield_management_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.53% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-29  0.46%  0.53%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-09-15  0.40%  0.46%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-08-31  0.39%  0.40%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-07-21  0.36%  0.39%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-03-12  0.32%  0.36%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-02-15  0.18%  0.32%  +0.13 \n 7  2024-02-09  0.16%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 8  2024-01-09  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-07-08  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 10  2023-06-13  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-05-18  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-05-08  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 13  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=d3b6dfd70db844c4499bec6ad6601623a565e674", "ref_desc": "Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GhZAgVzktYERQNmS6TvBTmefuA8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08", "ref_desc": "OpenSSL: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202402-08) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uQyzcLl95fHjtRfkOe-5xkAbcMQ.html"}]}
