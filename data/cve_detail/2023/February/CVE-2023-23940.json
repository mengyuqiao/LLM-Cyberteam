{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23940", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo is a library for secure smart contract development written in Cairo for StarkNet, a decentralized ZK Rollup. `is_valid_eth_signature` is missing a call to `finalize_keccak` after calling `verify_eth_signature`. As a result, any contract using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such as the `EthAccount` preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically, the malicious sequencer would be able to bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance of these accounts. The issue has been patched in 0.6.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23940", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForCairoVersions  from including (>=) 0.2.0andbefore (<) 0.6.1cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:cairo:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-16  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2024-02-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/pull/542/commits/6d4cb750478fca2fd916f73297632f899aca9299", "ref_desc": "Add finalize_keccak to is_valid_eth_signature by andrew-fleming \u00b7 Pull Request #542 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-626q-v9j4-mcp4", "ref_desc": "EthAccount can be impersonated by malicious prover \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
