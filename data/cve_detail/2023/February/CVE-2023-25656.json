{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25656", "Description": "notation-go is a collection of libraries for supporting Notation sign, verify, push, and pull of oci artifacts. Prior to version 1.0.0-rc.3, notation-go users will find their application using excessive memory when verifying signatures. The application will be killed, and thus availability is impacted. The problem has been patched in the release v1.0.0-rc.3. Some workarounds are available. Users can review their own trust policy file and check if the identity string contains `=#`. Meanwhile, users should only put trusted certificates in their trust stores referenced by their own trust policy files, and make sure the `authenticity` validation is set to `enforce`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25656", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNotaryproject\u00bbNotation-go\u00bbVersion:0.7.0UpdateAlpha1cpe:2.3:a:notaryproject:notation-go:0.7.0:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNotaryproject\u00bbNotation-go\u00bbVersion:0.8.0UpdateAlpha1cpe:2.3:a:notaryproject:notation-go:0.8.0:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNotaryproject\u00bbNotation-go\u00bbVersion:0.9.0UpdateAlpha1cpe:2.3:a:notaryproject:notation-go:0.9.0:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-12  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-02  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-27  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.3", "ref_desc": "Release v1.0.0-rc.3 \u00b7 notaryproject/notation-go \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-87x9-7grx-m28v", "ref_desc": "Excessive memory allocation on verification \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 notaryproject/notation-go \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
