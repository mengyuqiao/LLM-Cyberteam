{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25653", "Description": "node-jose is a JavaScript implementation of the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) for web browsers and node.js-based servers. Prior to version 2.2.0, when using the non-default \"fallback\" crypto back-end, ECC operations in `node-jose` can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, due to a possible infinite loop in an internal calculation. For some ECC operations, this condition is triggered randomly; for others, it can be triggered by malicious input. The issue has been patched in version 2.2.0. Since this issue is only present in the \"fallback\" crypto implementation, it can be avoided by ensuring that either WebCrypto or the Node `crypto` module is available in the JS environment where `node-jose` is being run.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25653", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbNode-jose\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.2.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:node-jose:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-08  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-29  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-23  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/security/advisories/GHSA-5h4j-qrvg-9xhw", "ref_desc": "Improper calculations in ECC implementation can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cisco/node-jose \u00b7 GitHubTechnical Description;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/commit/901d91508a70e3b9bdfc45688ea07bb4e1b8210d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5h4j-qrvg-9xhw \u00b7 cisco/node-jose@901d915 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
