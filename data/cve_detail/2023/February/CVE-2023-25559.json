{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25559", "Description": "DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. When not using authentication for the metadata service, which is the default configuration, the Metadata service (GMS) will use the X-DataHub-Actor HTTP header to infer the user the frontend is sending the request on behalf of. When the backends retrieves the header, its name is retrieved in a case-insensitive way. This case differential can be abused by an attacker to smuggle an X-DataHub-Actor header with different casing (eg: X-DATAHUB-ACTOR). This issue may lead to an authorization bypass by allowing any user to impersonate the system user account and perform any actions on its behalf. This vulnerability was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is tracked as GHSL-2022-079.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25559", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDatahub Project\u00bbDatahubVersions  before (<) 0.8.45cpe:2.3:a:datahub_project:datahub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-02  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-23  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2024-02-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-qgp2-qr66-j8r8", "ref_desc": "System account impersonation (`GHSL-2022-079`) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 datahub-project/datahub \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
