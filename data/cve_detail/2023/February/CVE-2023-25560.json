{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25560", "Description": "DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. The AuthServiceClient which is responsible for creation of new accounts, verifying credentials, resetting them or requesting access tokens, crafts multiple JSON strings using format strings with user-controlled data. This means that an attacker may be able to augment these JSON strings to be sent to the backend and that can potentially be abused by including new or colliding values. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass and the creation of system accounts, which effectively can lead to full system compromise. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This vulnerability was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is tracked as GHSL-2022-080.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25560", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDatahub Project\u00bbDatahubVersions  before (<) 0.8.45cpe:2.3:a:datahub_project:datahub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-02  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-23  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-17  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-01-11  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-913 Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/913/Improper-Control-of-Dynamically-Managed-Code-Resources.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-6rpf-5cfg-h8f3", "ref_desc": "JSON Injection (`GHSL-2022-080`) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 datahub-project/datahub \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
