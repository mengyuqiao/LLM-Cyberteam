This could also allow them to read non PHP files and retrieve their content. RCE could also be achieved if the attacker manage to upload a malicious image containing PHP code, and then include it via the affected attribute, on a default WP install, authors could easily achieve that given that they have the upload_file capability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0080", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nCusrev\u00bbCustomer Reviews For Woocommerce\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 5.16.0cpe:2.3:a:cusrev:customer_reviews_for_woocommerce:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-26  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-20  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-01-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-08  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/6b0d63ed-e244-4f20-8f10-a6e0c7ccadd4", "ref_desc": "Just a moment...Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
