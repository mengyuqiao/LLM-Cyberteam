{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25152", "Description": "Wings is Pterodactyl's server control plane. Affected versions are subject to a vulnerability which can be used to create new files and directory structures on the host system that previously did not exist, potentially allowing attackers to change their resource allocations, promote their containers to privileged mode, or potentially add ssh authorized keys to allow the attacker access to a remote shell on the target machine. In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing \"server\" allocated and controlled by the Wings Daemon. This vulnerability has been resolved in version `v1.11.3` of the Wings Daemon, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series in `v1.7.3`. Anyone running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to `v1.11.3` and anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.3`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. ### Workarounds None at this time.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25152", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPterodactyl\u00bbWingsVersions  before (<) 1.7.3cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPterodactyl\u00bbWings\u00bbVersion:1.11.1cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:1.11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPterodactyl\u00bbWings\u00bbVersion:1.11.2cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:1.11.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPterodactyl\u00bbWings\u00bbVersion:1.11.0cpe:2.3:a:pterodactyl:wings:1.11.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-31  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-21  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-15  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-01-09  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/59/Improper-Link-Resolution-Before-File-Access-Link-Following.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5", "ref_desc": "UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following allowing the creation of files and directory structures on the host system \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings \u00b7 GitHubVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eo5UWL4TLp30JlvruMN7KuTz2Kc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/dac9685298c3c1c49b3109fa4241aa88272b9f14", "ref_desc": "server(filesystem): SafePath tweaks \u00b7 pterodactyl/wings@dac9685 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
