{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25153", "Description": "containerd is an open source container runtime. Before versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18, when importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of bytes read for certain files. A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit was not applied could cause a denial of service. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25153", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbContainerdVersions  before (<) 1.5.18cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbContainerdVersions  from including (>=) 1.6.0andbefore (<) 1.6.18cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:containerd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.04%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/0c314901076a74a7b797a545d2f462285fdbb8c4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2 \u00b7 containerd/containerd@0c31490 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.18", "ref_desc": "Release containerd 1.6.18 \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4pXaeqs5U8A1RnSbejIydMt9Ync.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.18", "ref_desc": "Release containerd 1.5.18 \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ELsAhpLk4atOL1kBiydczvIcf_0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2", "ref_desc": "OCI image importer memory exhaustion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 containerd/containerd \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
