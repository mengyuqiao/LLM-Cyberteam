{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23924", "Description": "Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter. The URI validation on dompdf 2.0.1 can be bypassed on SVG parsing by passing `<image>` tags with uppercase letters. This may lead to arbitrary object unserialize on PHP < 8, through the `phar` URL wrapper. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URL with arbitrary protocols, if they can provide a SVG file to dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it leads to arbitrary unserialize, that will lead to the very least to an arbitrary file deletion and even remote code execution, depending on classes that are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23924", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDompdf Project\u00bbDompdf\u00bbVersion:2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:dompdf_project:dompdf:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  1.83%  2.57%  +0.74 \n 2  2024-09-21  1.08%  1.83%  +0.75 \n 3  2024-09-07  0.89%  1.08%  +0.20 \n 4  2024-08-23  0.99%  0.89%  -0.11 \n 5  2024-08-11  1.03%  0.99%  -0.04 \n 6  2024-07-13  1.04%  1.03%  -0.02 \n 7  2024-03-04  0.84%  1.04%  +0.21 \n 8  2024-02-07  0.58%  0.84%  +0.26 \n 9  2024-01-27  0.50%  0.58%  +0.08 \n 10  2024-01-01  0.45%  0.50%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-07-08  0.42%  0.45%  +0.02 \n 12  2023-05-08  0.83%  0.42%  -0.41 \n 13  2023-04-04  1.18%  0.83%  -0.34 \n 14  2023-03-07  46.46%  1.18%  -45.28 \n 15  2023-02-09  57.20%  46.46%  -10.75 \n 16  2023-02-02  5.63%  57.20%  +51.57 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-551 Incorrect Behavior Order: Authorization Before Parsing and Canonicalization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/551/Incorrect-Behavior-Order-Authorization-Before-Parsing-and-C.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases/tag/v2.0.2", "ref_desc": "Release Dompdf 2.0.2 \u00b7 dompdf/dompdf \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/security/advisories/GHSA-3cw5-7cxw-v5qg", "ref_desc": "URI validation failure on SVG parsing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dompdf/dompdf \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/commit/7558f07f693b2ac3266089f21051e6b78c6a0c85", "ref_desc": "SVG parsing - comparing the tag name in a case insensitive way \u00b7 dompdf/dompdf@7558f07 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
