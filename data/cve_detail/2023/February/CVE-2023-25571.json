{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25571", "Description": "Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. `@backstage/catalog-model` prior to version 1.2.0, `@backstage/core-components` prior to 0.12.4, and `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend` prior to 1.7.2 are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor with access to add or modify content in an instance of the Backstage software catalog to inject script URLs in the entities stored in the catalog. If users of the catalog then click on said URLs, that can lead to an XSS attack. This vulnerability has been patched in both the frontend and backend implementations. The default `Link` component from `@backstage/core-components` version 1.2.0 and greater will now reject `javascript:` URLs, and there is a global override of `window.open` to do the same. In addition, the catalog model v0.12.4 and greater as well as the catalog backend v1.7.2 and greater now has additional validation built in that prevents `javascript:` URLs in known annotations. As a workaround, the general practice of limiting access to modifying catalog content and requiring code reviews greatly help mitigate this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25571", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbBackstage Plugin-catalog-backend\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.7.2cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:backstage_plugin-catalog-backend:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbBackstage Core-components\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.12.4cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:backstage_core-components:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbBackstage Catalog-model\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:backstage_catalog-model:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-84 Improper Neutralization of Encoded URI Schemes in a Web Page", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/84/Improper-Neutralization-of-Encoded-URI-Schemes-in-a-Web-Page.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-7hv8-3fr9-j2hv", "ref_desc": "XSS Vulnerability in Software Catalog \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 backstage/backstage \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/3d1371954512f7fa8bd0e2d357e00eada2c3e8a8", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7hv8-3fr9-j2hv \u00b7 backstage/backstage@3d13719 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
