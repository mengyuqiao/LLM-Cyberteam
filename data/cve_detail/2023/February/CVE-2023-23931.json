{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23931", "Description": "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23931", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCryptography.io\u00bbCryptography\u00bbForPythonVersions  from including (>=) 1.8andbefore (<) 39.0.1cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-30  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-20  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-11  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-14  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-01-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/8230/commits/94a50a9731f35405f0357fa5f3b177d46a726ab3", "ref_desc": "Don't allow update_into to mutate immutable objects by alex \u00b7 Pull Request #8230 \u00b7 pyca/cryptography \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/security/advisories/GHSA-w7pp-m8wf-vj6r", "ref_desc": "Cipher.update_into can corrupt memory if passed an immutable python object as the outbuf \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pyca/cryptography \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
