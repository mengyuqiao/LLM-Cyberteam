{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30855", "Description": "Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. Versions of Pimcore prior to 10.5.18 are vulnerable to path traversal. The impact of this path traversal and arbitrary extension is limited to creation of arbitrary files and appending data to existing files. When combined with the SQL Injection, the exported data `RESTRICTED DIFFUSION 9 / 9` can be controlled and a webshell can be uploaded. Attackers can use that to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server with the permissions of the webserver. Users may upgrade to version 10.5.18 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, apply the patch manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30855", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection;Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nPimcore\u00bbPimcoreVersions  before (<) 10.5.18cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:pimcore:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-09  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-14  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-04-07  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/f1d904094700b513c4756904fa2b1e19d08d890e.patch", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/14498", "ref_desc": "[Bug] createCSV in CustomReportsController by mcop1 \u00b7 Pull Request #14498 \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-g2mc-fqqc-hxg3", "ref_desc": "Path Traversal in AdminBundle/Controller/Reports/CustomReportController.php \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
