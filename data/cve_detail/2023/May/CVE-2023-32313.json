{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32313", "Description": "vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. In versions 3.9.17 and lower of vm2 it was possible to get a read-write reference to the node `inspect` method and edit options for `console.log`. As a result a threat actor can edit options for the `console.log` command. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may make the `inspect` method readonly with `vm.readonly(inspect)` after creating a vm.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32313", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVm2 Project\u00bbVM2\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.9.18cpe:2.3:a:vm2_project:vm2:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.10%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-21  0.07%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-14  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/5206ba25afd86ef547a2c9d48d46ca7a9e6ec238", "ref_desc": "Inspect method should be readonly \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2@5206ba2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/releases/tag/3.9.18", "ref_desc": "Release 3.9.18 \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/15AZvHsZcg5fa_HN99qit8SXPjs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/arkark/c1c57eaf3e0a649af1a70c2b93b17550", "ref_desc": "PoC for breaking console.log in vm2@3.9.17 \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-p5gc-c584-jj6v", "ref_desc": "Inspect Manipulation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
