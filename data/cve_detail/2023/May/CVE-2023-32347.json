{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32347", "Description": "Teltonika\u2019s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 use device serial numbers and MAC addresses to identify devices from the user perspective for device claiming and from the device perspective for authentication. If an attacker obtained the serial number and MAC address of a device, they could authenticate as that device and steal communication credentials of the device. This could allow an attacker to enable arbitrary command execution as root by utilizing management options within the newly registered devices.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32347", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nTeltonika\u00bbRemote Management SystemVersions  before (<) 4.10.0cpe:2.3:a:teltonika:remote_management_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-23  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-05-28  0.14%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-04-21  0.14%  0.14%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-01  0.05%  0.14%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-131-08", "ref_desc": "Teltonika Remote Management System and RUT Model Routers | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wzOfaBL9cQf__UzTEpjcXalFLNI.html"}]}
