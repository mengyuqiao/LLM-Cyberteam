{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31125", "Description": "Engine.IO is the implementation of transport-based cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. An uncaught exception vulnerability was introduced in version 5.1.0 and included in version 4.1.0 of the `socket.io` parent package. Older versions are not impacted. A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the `engine.io` package, including those who use depending packages like `socket.io`. This issue was fixed in version 6.4.2 of Engine.IO. There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31125", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSocket\u00bbEngine.io\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 5.1.0andbefore (<) 6.4.2cpe:2.3:a:socket:engine.io:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-05-14  0.10%  0.19%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-05-03  0.10%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-20  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-16  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230622-0002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-31125 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/fc480b4f305e16fe5972cf337d055e598372dc44", "ref_desc": "fix: prevent crash when provided with an invalid query param \u00b7 socketio/engine.io@fc480b4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/releases/tag/6.4.2", "ref_desc": "Release 6.4.2 \u00b7 socketio/engine.io \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-q9mw-68c2-j6m5", "ref_desc": "Uncaught exception in engine.io \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 socketio/engine.io \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
