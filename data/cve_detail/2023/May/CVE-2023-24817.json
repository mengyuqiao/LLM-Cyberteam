{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24817", "Description": "RIOT-OS, an operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2023.04, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in an integer underflow and out of bounds access in the packet buffer. Triggering the access at the right time will corrupt other packets or the allocator metadata. Corrupting a pointer will lead to denial of service. This issue is fixed in version 2023.04. As a workaround, disable SRH in the network stack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24817", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRiot-os\u00bbRiotVersions  before (<) 2023.04cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-06-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-xjgw-7638-29g5", "ref_desc": "Out of Bounds write in routing with SRH \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/34dc1757f5621be48e226cfebb2f4c63505b5360", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xjgw-7638-29g5 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT@34dc175 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
