{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33962", "Description": "JStachio is a  type-safe Java Mustache templating engine. Prior to version 1.0.1, JStachio fails to escape single quotes `'` in HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users visiting pages that use this template engine. This can lead to various consequences, including session hijacking, defacement of web pages, theft of sensitive information, or even the propagation of malware.\n\nVersion 1.0.1 contains a patch for this issue. To mitigate this vulnerability, the template engine should properly escape special characters, including single quotes. Common practice is to escape `'` as `&#39`. As a workaround, users can avoid this issue by using only double quotes `\"` for HTML attributes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33962", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nJstachio Project\u00bbJstachioVersions  before (<) 1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:jstachio_project:jstachio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-03  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-07-01  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-06-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-06-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jstachio/jstachio/commit/7b2f78377d1284df14c580be762a25af5f8dcd66", "ref_desc": "Fix #157 add more aggressive html5 escaping \u00b7 jstachio/jstachio@7b2f783 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jstachio/jstachio/pull/158", "ref_desc": "Fix #157 add more aggressive html5 escaping by agentgt \u00b7 Pull Request #158 \u00b7 jstachio/jstachio \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jstachio/jstachio/releases/tag/v1.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.0.1 \u00b7 jstachio/jstachio \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jstachio/jstachio/security/advisories/GHSA-gwxv-jv83-6qjr", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability: Unescaped single quotes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jstachio/jstachio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jstachio/jstachio/issues/157", "ref_desc": "More aggressive escaping \u00b7 Issue #157 \u00b7 jstachio/jstachio \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
