The memory dump can be a KeePass process dump, swap file (pagefile.sys), hibernation file (hiberfil.sys), or RAM dump of the entire system. The first character cannot be recovered. In 2.54, there is different API usage and/or random string insertion for mitigation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32784", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKeepass\u00bbKeepassVersions  from including (>=) 2.00andbefore (<) 2.54cpe:2.3:a:keepass:keepass:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.18%  0.14%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.18%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-05-21  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-04-14  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-12-09  0.14%  0.10%  -0.04 \n 6  2023-09-17  0.20%  0.14%  -0.06 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.07%  0.20%  +0.13 \n 8  2023-05-27  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-05-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/discussions/9433", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-32784 : is KeepassXC affected ? \u00b7 keepassxreboot/keepassxc \u00b7 Discussion #9433 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper", "ref_desc": "GitHub - vdohney/keepass-password-dumperExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/f3438e6283/", "ref_desc": "KeePass / Discussion / Open Discussion: Security - Dumping Master Password from Memory, Even When LockedIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
