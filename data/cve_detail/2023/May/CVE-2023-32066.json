{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32066", "Description": "Time Tracker is an open source time tracking system. The week view plugin in Time Tracker versions 1.22.11.5782 and prior was not escaping titles for notes in week view table. Because of that, it was possible for a logged in user to enter notes with elements of JavaScript. Such script could then be executed in user browser on subsequent requests to week view. This issue is fixed in version 1.22.12.5783. As a workaround, use `htmlspecialchars` when calling `$field->setTitle` on line #245 in the `week.php` file,  as happens in version 1.22.12.5783.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32066", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nAnuko\u00bbTime TrackerVersions  before (<) 1.22.12.5783cpe:2.3:a:anuko:time_tracker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-15  0.06%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-18  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/093cfe158099704ffd4a1624be217f9935e914eb", "ref_desc": "Addressed stored XSS vulnerability in week.php by escaping cell title. \u00b7 anuko/timetracker@093cfe1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-jw2g-8wvp-9frw", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS vulnerability in Week View plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anuko/timetracker \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
