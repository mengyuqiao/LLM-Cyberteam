{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33964", "Description": "mx-chain-go is an implementation of the MultiversX blockchain protocol written in the Go language. Metachain cannot process a cross-shard miniblock. Prior to version 1.4.16, an invalid transaction with the wrong username on metachain is not treated correctly on the metachain transaction processor. This is strictly a processing issue that could have happened on MultiversX chain. If an error like this had occurred, the metachain would have stopped notarizing blocks from the shard chains. The resuming of notarization is possible only after applying a patched binary version. A patch in version 1.4.16 introduces `processIfTxErrorCrossShard` for the metachain transaction processor. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33964", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nMultiversx\u00bbMx-chain-go\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.4.16cpe:2.3:a:multiversx:mx-chain-go:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-02  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-06  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-30  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/commit/97295471465f4b5f79e51b32f8b7111f8d921606", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7xpv-4pm9-xch2 \u00b7 multiversx/mx-chain-go@9729547 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go/security/advisories/GHSA-7xpv-4pm9-xch2", "ref_desc": "Add processIfTxErrorCrossShard on metaChain transaction processor \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 multiversx/mx-chain-go \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
