{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33188", "Description": "Omni-notes is an open source note-taking application for Android. The Omni-notes Android app had an insufficient path validation vulnerability when displaying the details of a note received through an externally-provided intent. The paths of the note's attachments were not properly validated, allowing malicious or compromised applications in the same device to force Omni-notes to copy files from its internal storage to its external storage directory, where they would have become accessible to any component with permission to read the external storage. Updating to the newest version (6.2.7) of Omni-notes Android fixes this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33188", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOmninotes\u00bbOmni Notes\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.2.6cpe:2.3:a:omninotes:omni_notes:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-06-03  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-441 Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/441/Unintended-Proxy-or-Intermediary-Confused-Deputy-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/security/advisories/GHSA-g38r-4cf6-3v32", "ref_desc": "Uncontrolled data used in content resolution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 federicoiosue/Omni-Notes \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
