{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32081", "Description": "Vert.x STOMP is a vert.x implementation of the STOMP specification that provides a STOMP server and client. From versions 3.1.0 until 3.9.16 and 4.0.0 until 4.4.2, a Vert.x STOMP server processes client STOMP frames without checking that the client send an initial CONNECT frame replied with a successful CONNECTED frame. The client can subscribe to a destination or publish message without prior authentication. Any Vert.x STOMP server configured with an authentication handler is impacted. The issue is patched in Vert.x 3.9.16 and 4.4.2. There are no trivial workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32081", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbVert.x StompVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.0andbefore (<) 3.9.16cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:vert.x_stomp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEclipse\u00bbVert.x StompVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.4.2cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:vert.x_stomp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-13  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-18  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-05-07  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-04-11  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-05-25  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-stomp/security/advisories/GHSA-gvrq-cg5r-7chp", "ref_desc": "STOMP server process client frames that would not send initially a connect frame \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vert-x3/vertx-stomp \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-stomp/commit/0de4bc5a44ddb57e74d92c445f16456fa03f265b", "ref_desc": "STOMP server process client frames that would not send initially a co\u2026 \u00b7 vert-x3/vertx-stomp@0de4bc5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
