{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31146", "Description": "Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, during codegen, the length word of a dynarray is written before the data, which can result in out-of-bounds array access in the case where the dynarray is on both the lhs and rhs of an assignment. The issue can cause data corruption across call frames. The expected behavior is to revert due to out-of-bounds array access. Version 0.3.8 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31146", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyperVersions  before (<) 0.3.8cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-12  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-17  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-04-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-23  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/4f8289a81206f767df1900ac48f485d90fc87edb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-3p37-3636-q8wv \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@4f8289a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-3p37-3636-q8wv", "ref_desc": "OOB DynArray access when array is on both LHS and RHS of an assignment \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
