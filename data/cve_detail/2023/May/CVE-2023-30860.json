{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30860", "Description": "WWBN AVideo is an open source video platform. In AVideo prior to version 12.4, a normal user can make a Meeting Schedule where the user can invite another user in that Meeting, but it does not properly sanitize the malicious characters when creating a Meeting Room. This allows attacker to insert malicious scripts. Since any USER including the ADMIN can see the meeting room that was created by the attacker this can lead to cookie hijacking and takeover of any accounts. Version 12.4 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30860", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nWwbn\u00bbAvideoVersions  before (<) 12.4cpe:2.3:a:wwbn:avideo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-14  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-18  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://youtu.be/Nke0Bmv5F-o", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS leads to any User's Account Takeover including Admin's Account - YouTubeExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo/security/advisories/GHSA-xr9h-p2rc-rpqm", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS leads to any User's Account Takeover including Admin's Account \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 WWBN/AVideo \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
