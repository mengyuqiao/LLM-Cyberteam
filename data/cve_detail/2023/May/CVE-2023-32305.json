{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32305", "Description": "aiven-extras is a PostgreSQL extension. Versions prior to 1.1.9 contain a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing elevation to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases that use the aiven-extras package. The vulnerability leverages missing schema qualifiers on privileged functions called by the aiven-extras extension. A low privileged user can create objects that collide with existing function names, which will then be executed instead. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a low privileged user to acquire `superuser` privileges, which would allow full, unrestricted access to all data and database functions. And could lead to arbitrary code execution or data access on the underlying host as the `postgres` user. The issue has been patched as of version 1.1.9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32305", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAiven\u00bbAiven\u00bbForPostgresqlVersions  before (<) 1.1.9cpe:2.3:a:aiven:aiven:*:*:*:*:*:postgresql:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Postgresql\u00bbPostgresqlWhen used together with:Postgresql\u00bbPostgresqlWhen used together with:Postgresql\u00bbPostgresqlWhen used together with:Postgresql\u00bbPostgresqlWhen used together with:Postgresql\u00bbPostgresql", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.29%  0.34%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-18  0.18%  0.28%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-04-23  0.25%  0.18%  -0.08 \n 5  2024-03-18  0.18%  0.25%  +0.08 \n 6  2024-02-13  0.19%  0.18%  -0.01 \n 7  2024-02-02  0.23%  0.19%  -0.05 \n 8  2023-06-17  0.21%  0.23%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-05-25  0.04%  0.21%  +0.16 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras/commit/8682ae01bec0791708bf25791786d776e2fb0250", "ref_desc": "Qualify function calls with pg_catalog schema \u00b7 aiven/aiven-extras@8682ae0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230616-0006/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-32305 PostgreSQL Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras/security/advisories/GHSA-7r4w-fw4h-67gp", "ref_desc": "PostgreSQL Privilege Escalation Through Missing Schema Qualifiers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aiven/aiven-extras \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
