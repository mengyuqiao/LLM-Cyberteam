{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27408", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE LPE9403 (All versions < V2.1). The `i2c` mutex file is created with the permissions bits of `-rw-rw-rw-`. This file is used as a mutex for multiple applications interacting with i2c. This could allow an authenticated attacker with access to the SSH interface on the affected device to interfere with the integrity of the mutex and the data it protects.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27408", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSiemens\u00bbScalance Lpe9403 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 2.1cpe:2.3:o:siemens:scalance_lpe9403_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Siemens\u00bbScalance Lpe9403\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-378 Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/378/Creation-of-Temporary-File-With-Insecure-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-325383.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rFeuGJEGk051wQJ9cgoWhYgXehE.html"}]}
