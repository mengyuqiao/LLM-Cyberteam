{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25933", "Description": "A type confusion bug in TypedArray prior to commit e6ed9c1a4b02dc219de1648f44cd808a56171b81 could have been used by a malicious attacker to execute arbitrary code via untrusted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25933", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermes\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.42%  0.47%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-06-19  0.36%  0.42%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-05-24  0.19%  0.36%  +0.17 \n 4  2024-04-17  0.13%  0.19%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-05-27  0.04%  0.13%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-843 Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/843/Access-of-Resource-Using-Incompatible-Type-Type-Confusion-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/e6ed9c1a4b02dc219de1648f44cd808a56171b81", "ref_desc": "Re-sync with internal repository (#960) \u00b7 facebook/hermes@e6ed9c1 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6ghbt5aKEXDcRYpOgdw-Sovt3yk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2023-25933", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-25933Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
