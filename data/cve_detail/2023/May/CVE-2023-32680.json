{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32680", "Description": "Metabase is an open source business analytics engine. To edit SQL Snippets, Metabase should have required people to be in at least one group with native query editing permissions to a database\u2013but affected versions of Metabase didn't enforce that requirement. This lack of enforcement meant that: Anyone\u2013including people in sandboxed groups\u2013could edit SQL snippets. They could edit snippets via the API or, in the application UI, when editing the metadata for a model based on a SQL question, and people in sandboxed groups could edit a SQL snippet used in a query that creates their sandbox. If the snippet contained logic that restricted which data that person could see, they could potentially edit that snippet and change their level of data access. The permissions model for SQL snippets has been fixed in Metabase versions 0.46.3, 0.45.4, 0.44.7, 1.46.3, 1.45.4, and 1.44.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that SQL queries used to create sandboxes exclude SQL snippets.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32680", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  before (<) 0.44.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.45.0andbefore (<) 0.45.4cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.44.7cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.46.0andbefore (<) 0.46.3cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.45.0andbefore (<) 1.45.4cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.46.0andbefore (<) 1.46.3cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "N/A", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/30853", "ref_desc": "Backport SQL snippets fix to 45 by noahmoss \u00b7 Pull Request #30853 \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/30852", "ref_desc": "Backport SQL snippets fix to 46 by noahmoss \u00b7 Pull Request #30852 \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/30854", "ref_desc": "Backport SQL snippets fix to 44 by noahmoss \u00b7 Pull Request #30854 \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-mw6j-f894-4qxv", "ref_desc": "Native models enable people without SQL permissions to create and edit SQL snippets \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
