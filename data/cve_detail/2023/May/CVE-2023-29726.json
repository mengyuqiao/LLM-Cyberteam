{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29726", "Description": "The Call Blocker application 6.6.3 for Android incorrectly opens a key component that an attacker can use to inject large amounts of dirty data into the application's database. When the application starts, it loads the data from the database into memory. Once the attacker injects too much data, the application triggers an OOM error and crashes, resulting in a persistent denial of service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29726", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nApplika\u00bbCall Blocker\u00bbVersion:6.6.3ForAndroidcpe:2.3:a:applika:call_blocker:6.6.3:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.06%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/LianKee/SO-CVEs/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2023-29726/CVE%20detail.md", "ref_desc": "SO-CVEs/CVE detail.md at main \u00b7 LianKee/SO-CVEs \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cuiet.blockCalls", "ref_desc": "Call Blocker - Caller ID - Apps on Google PlayProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Idlxq50WgoZvB_UBTzKkU8RJGGM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.call-blocker.info/", "ref_desc": "Call Blocker \u2013 Call Blocker \u2013 block incoming and outgoing callsProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wHyMZqyAi9YwxmQPNpn1iR_DFJA.html"}]}
