{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33187", "Description": "Highlight is an open source, full-stack monitoring platform. Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to `type=\"text\"` via a javascript \"Show Password\" button. This differs from the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type=\"password\"` inputs. A customer may assume that switching to `type=\"text\"` would also not record this input; hence, they would not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation to this part of the DOM, resulting in unintentional recording of a password value when a `Show Password` button is used. This issue was patched in version 6.0.0.\nThis patch tracks changes to the `type` attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a `type=\"password\"` continues to be obfuscated.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33187", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHighlight\u00bbHighlight\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 6.0.0cpe:2.3:a:highlight:highlight:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-01  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-25  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-06-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/highlight/highlight/security/advisories/GHSA-9qpj-qq2r-5mcc", "ref_desc": "html inputs of type password recorded in plaintext when converted to text inputs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 highlight/highlight \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/pull/1184", "ref_desc": "fix: Fix input.type check by mydea \u00b7 Pull Request #1184 \u00b7 rrweb-io/rrweb \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
