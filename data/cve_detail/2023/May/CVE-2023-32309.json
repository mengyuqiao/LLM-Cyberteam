{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32309", "Description": "PyMdown Extensions is a set of extensions for the `Python-Markdown` markdown project. In affected versions an arbitrary file read is possible when using include file syntax. By using the syntax `--8<--\"/etc/passwd\"` or `--8<--\"/proc/self/environ\"` the content of these files will be rendered in the generated documentation. Additionally, a path relative to a specified, allowed base path can also be used to render the content of a file outside the specified base paths: `--8<-- \"../../../../etc/passwd\"`. Within the Snippets extension, there exists a `base_path` option but the implementation is vulnerable to Directory Traversal. The vulnerable section exists in `get_snippet_path(self, path)` lines 155 to 174 in snippets.py. Any readable file on the host where the plugin is executing may have its content exposed. This can impact any use of Snippets that exposes the use of Snippets to external users. It is never recommended to use Snippets to process user-facing, dynamic content. It is designed to process known content on the backend under the control of the host, but if someone were to accidentally enable it for user-facing content, undesired information could be exposed. This issue has been addressed in version 10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may restrict relative paths by filtering input.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32309", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nPymdown Extensions Project\u00bbPymdown ExtensionsVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 10.0cpe:2.3:a:pymdown_extensions_project:pymdown_extensions:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-21  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-14  0.09%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-26  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/commit/b7bb4878d6017c03c8dc97c42d8d3bb6ee81db9d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jh85-wwv9-24hv \u00b7 facelessuser/pymdown-extensions@b7bb487 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-jh85-wwv9-24hv", "ref_desc": "Any file can be included with the pymdowm-snippets extension \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 facelessuser/pymdown-extensions \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
