{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30861", "Description": "Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.\n\n1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.\n2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`\n3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.\n4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).\n5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.\n\nThis happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30861", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPalletsprojects\u00bbFlaskVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.3.2cpe:2.3:a:palletsprojects:flask:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPalletsprojects\u00bbFlaskVersions  before (<) 2.2.5cpe:2.3:a:palletsprojects:flask:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-22  0.25%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-10-12  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-08-06  0.19%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-06-03  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-08  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-04-01  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-08-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-08-19  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-06-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-05-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-539 Use of Persistent Cookies Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/539/Use-of-Persistent-Cookies-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/flask/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq", "ref_desc": "Possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary: Cookie header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pallets/flask \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/70f906c51ce49c485f1d355703e9cc3386b1cc2b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq \u00b7 pallets/flask@70f906c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5442", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5442-1 flask", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0006/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-30861 Flask Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/afd63b16170b7c047f5758eb910c416511e9c965", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #5109 from pallets/backport-vary-cookie \u00b7 pallets/flask@afd63b1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.3.2", "ref_desc": "Release 2.3.2 \u00b7 pallets/flask \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00024.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3536-1] flask security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.2.5", "ref_desc": "Release 2.2.5 \u00b7 pallets/flask \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
