{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31134", "Description": "Tauri is software for building applications for multi-platform deployment. The Tauri IPC is usually strictly isolated from external websites, but in versions 1.0.0 until 1.0.9, 1.1.0 until 1.1.4, and 1.2.0 until 1.2.5, the isolation can be bypassed by redirecting an existing Tauri window to an external website. This is either possible by an application implementing a feature for users to visit\narbitrary websites or due to a bug allowing the open redirect. This allows the external website access to the IPC layer and therefore to all configured and exposed Tauri API endpoints and application specific implemented Tauri commands. This issue has been patched in versions 1.0.9, 1.1.4, and 1.2.5. As a workaround, prevent arbitrary input in redirect features and/or only allow trusted websites access to the IPC.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31134", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nTauri\u00bbTauriVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andbefore (<) 1.2.5cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTauri\u00bbTauriVersions  from including (>=) 1.1.0andbefore (<) 1.1.4cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTauri\u00bbTauriVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.0.9cpe:2.3:a:tauri:tauri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-05-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/58ea0b45268dbd46cbac0ebb0887353d057ca767", "ref_desc": "feat(core): block remote URLs from accessing the IPC \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri@58ea0b4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-4wm2-cwcf-wwvp", "ref_desc": "Open Redirect Possibly Exposes IPC to External Sites \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/releases/tag/tauri-v1.1.4", "ref_desc": "Release tauri v1.1.4 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/fa90214b052b1a5d38d54fbf1ca422b4c37cfd1f", "ref_desc": "feat(core): block remote URLs from accessing the IPC \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri@fa90214 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/releases/tag/tauri-v1.2.5", "ref_desc": "Release tauri v1.2.5 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/releases/tag/tauri-v1.0.9", "ref_desc": "Release tauri v1.0.9 \u00b7 tauri-apps/tauri \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
