{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32307", "Description": "Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant with the IETF RFC3261 specification.\nReferring to [GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54), several other potential heap-over-flow and integer-overflow in stun_parse_attr_error_code and stun_parse_attr_uint32 were found because the lack of attributes length check when Sofia-SIP handles STUN packets. The previous patch of [GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54) fixed the vulnerability when attr_type did not match the enum value, but there are also vulnerabilities in the handling of other valid cases. The OOB read and integer-overflow made by attacker may lead to crash, high consumption of memory or even other more serious consequences. These issue have been addressed in version 1.13.15. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32307", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSignalwire\u00bbSofia-sipVersions  before (<) 1.13.15cpe:2.3:a:signalwire:sofia-sip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-27  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-06-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-06-09  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/122/Heap-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OY66DOQ3B7GULJTI66X5HNX5FU3P65CX/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: sofia-sip-1.13.12-2.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-rm4c-ccvf-ff9c", "ref_desc": "heap-over-flow and integer-overflow in stun_parse_attr_error_code and stun_parse_attr_uint32 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 freeswitch/sofia-sip \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00002.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3441-1] sofia-sip security updateMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5431", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5431-1 sofia-sip", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
