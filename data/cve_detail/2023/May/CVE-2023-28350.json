{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28350", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Faronics Insight 10.0.19045 on Windows. Attacker-supplied input is not validated/sanitized before being rendered in both the Teacher and Student Console applications, enabling an attacker to execute JavaScript in these applications. Due to the rich and highly privileged functionality offered by the Teacher Console, the ability to silently exploit Cross Site Scripting (XSS) on the Teacher Machine enables remote code execution on any connected student machine (and the teacher's machine).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28350", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFaronics\u00bbInsight\u00bbVersion:10.0.19045cpe:2.3:a:faronics:insight:10.0.19045:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.15%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.09%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-04-29  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-06-14  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://research.nccgroup.com/?research=Technical%20advisories", "ref_desc": "NCC Group Research \u2013 Making the world safer and more secureThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/58kgiHYoA48zcbHKl_LkYWkU_EU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/05/30/technical-advisory-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-faronics-insight/", "ref_desc": "ExploitCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GDmKTDB2LfqIdvjNLOf-BZJ_LwA.html"}]}
