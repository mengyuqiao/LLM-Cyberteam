{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32303", "Description": "Planet is software that provides satellite data. The secret file stores the user's Planet API authentication information. It should only be accessible by the user, but before version 2.0.1, its permissions allowed the user's group and non-group to read the file as well. This issue was patched in version 2.0.1. As a workaround, set the secret file permissions to only user read/write by hand.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32303", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPlanet\u00bbPlanetVersions  before (<) 2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:planet:planet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/security/advisories/GHSA-j5fj-rfh6-qj85", "ref_desc": "secret file is created with excessive permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 planetlabs/planet-client-python \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/commit/d71415a83119c5e89d7b80d5f940d162376ee3b7", "ref_desc": "enforce restricting secret file permissions to user read/write \u00b7 planetlabs/planet-client-python@d71415a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/releases/tag/2.0.1", "ref_desc": "Release 2.0.1 \u00b7 planetlabs/planet-client-python \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
