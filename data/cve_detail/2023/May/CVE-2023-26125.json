{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26125", "Description": "Versions of the package github.com/gin-gonic/gin before 1.9.0 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation by allowing an attacker to use a specially crafted request via the X-Forwarded-Prefix header, potentially leading to cache poisoning.\r\r**Note:** Although this issue does not pose a significant threat on its own it can serve as an input vector for other more impactful vulnerabilities. However, successful exploitation may depend on the server configuration and whether the header is used in the application logic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26125", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGin-gonic\u00bbGINVersions  before (<) 1.9.0cpe:2.3:a:gin-gonic:gin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-14  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-10  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-03  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 6  2023-06-10  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-05-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/releases/tag/v1.9.0", "ref_desc": "Release v1.9.0 \u00b7 gin-gonic/gin \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3500", "ref_desc": "Add escape logic for header by t0rchwo0d \u00b7 Pull Request #3500 \u00b7 gin-gonic/gin \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3503", "ref_desc": "Fix #3500 Add escape logic for header by t0rchwo0d \u00b7 Pull Request #3503 \u00b7 gin-gonic/gin \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMGINGONICGIN-3324285", "ref_desc": "Improper Input Validation in github.com/gin-gonic/gin | CVE-2023-26125 | SnykExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/t0rchwo0d/gin/commit/fd9f98e70fb4107ee68c783482d231d35e60507b", "ref_desc": "Fix #3500 Add escape logic for header \u00b7 t0rchwo0d/gin@fd9f98e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
