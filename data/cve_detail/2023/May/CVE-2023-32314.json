{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32314", "Description": "vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32314", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nVm2 Project\u00bbVM2\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.9.18cpe:2.3:a:vm2_project:vm2:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  1.62%  1.60%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-08-06  1.33%  1.62%  +0.30 \n 3  2024-06-16  1.24%  1.33%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-05-21  0.69%  1.24%  +0.54 \n 5  2024-05-10  0.54%  0.69%  +0.16 \n 6  2024-04-14  0.46%  0.54%  +0.07 \n 7  2024-03-10  0.46%  0.46%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-11-05  0.41%  0.46%  +0.05 \n 9  2023-09-17  0.43%  0.41%  -0.02 \n 10  2023-08-22  0.37%  0.43%  +0.06 \n 11  2023-05-25  0.06%  0.37%  +0.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/releases/tag/3.9.18", "ref_desc": "Release 3.9.18 \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/15AZvHsZcg5fa_HN99qit8SXPjs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-whpj-8f3w-67p5", "ref_desc": "Sandbox Escape \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/d88105f99752305c5b8a77b63ddee3ec86912daf", "ref_desc": "Ensure host array does not leak through proxy \u00b7 patriksimek/vm2@d88105f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/arkark/e9f5cf5782dec8321095be3e52acf5ac", "ref_desc": "Sandbox Escape in vm2@3.9.17 \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
