{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31141", "Description": "OpenSearch is open-source software suite for search, analytics, and observability applications. Prior to versions 1.3.10 and 2.7.0, there is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where they are not correctly applied to the queries during extremely rare race conditions potentially leading to incorrect access authorization. For this issue to be triggered, two concurrent requests need to land on the same instance exactly when query cache eviction happens, once every four hours. OpenSearch 1.3.10 and 2.7.0 contain a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31141", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  before (<) 1.3.10cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch SecurityVersions  before (<) 1.3.10cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch SecurityVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-09  0.15%  0.15%  0.00 \n 4  2024-05-14  0.09%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-04-07  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-05-16  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-g8xc-6mf7-h28h", "ref_desc": "Issue with fine-grained access control during extremely rare race conditions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/security \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
