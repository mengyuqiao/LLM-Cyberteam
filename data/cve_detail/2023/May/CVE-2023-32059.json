{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32059", "Description": "Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, internal calls with default arguments are compiled incorrectly. Depending on the number of arguments provided in the call, the defaults are added not right-to-left, but left-to-right. If the types are incompatible, typechecking is bypassed. The ability to pass kwargs to internal functions is an undocumented feature that is not well known about. The issue is patched in version 0.3.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32059", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyperVersions  before (<) 0.3.8cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-683 Function Call With Incorrect Order of Arguments", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/683/Function-Call-With-Incorrect-Order-of-Arguments.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/c3e68c302aa6e1429946473769dd1232145822ac", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-ph9x-4vc9-m39g \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@c3e68c3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-ph9x-4vc9-m39g", "ref_desc": "incorrect ordering of default arguments passed to internal calls \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
