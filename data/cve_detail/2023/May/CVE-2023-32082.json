{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32082", "Description": "etcd is a distributed key-value store for the data of a distributed system. Prior to versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9, the LeaseTimeToLive API allows access to key names (not value) associated to a lease when `Keys` parameter is true, even a user doesn't have read permission to the keys. The impact is limited to a cluster which enables auth (RBAC). Versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9 fix this issue. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32082", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nEtcd\u00bbEtcdVersions  before (<) 3.4.26cpe:2.3:a:etcd:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEtcd\u00bbEtcdVersions  from including (>=) 3.5.0andbefore (<) 3.5.9cpe:2.3:a:etcd:etcd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2024-05-17  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-10  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.5.md", "ref_desc": "etcd/CHANGELOG-3.5.md at main \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/15656", "ref_desc": "protect LeaseTimeToLive with RBAC by mitake \u00b7 Pull Request #15656 \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.4.md", "ref_desc": "etcd/CHANGELOG-3.4.md at main \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-3p4g-rcw5-8298", "ref_desc": "Key name can be accessed via LeaseTimeToLive API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 etcd-io/etcd \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
