{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32679", "Description": "Craft CMS is an open source content management system. In affected versions of Craft CMS an unrestricted file extension may lead to Remote Code Execution. If the name parameter value is not empty string('') in the View.php's doesTemplateExist() -> resolveTemplate() -> _resolveTemplateInternal() -> _resolveTemplate() function, it returns directly without extension verification, so that arbitrary extension files are rendered as twig templates. When attacker with admin privileges on a DEV or an improperly configured STG or PROD environment, they can exploit this vulnerability to remote code execution. Code execution may grant the attacker access to the host operating system. This issue has been addressed in version 4.4.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32679", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCraftcms\u00bbCraft CmsVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.4.6cpe:2.3:a:craftcms:craft_cms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-25  0.15%  0.23%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-04-18  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-03-25  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-09  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-09-21  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-08-26  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-05-27  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-vqxf-r9ph-cc9c", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via unrestricted file extension \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 craftcms/cms \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
