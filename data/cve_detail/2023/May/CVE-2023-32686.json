{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32686", "Description": "Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and automated testing. Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous files from being uploaded. The upload validation checks were not robust enough which left the possibility of an attacker to circumvent them and upload a potentially dangerous file. Exploiting this flaw, a combination of files could be uploaded so that they work together to circumvent the existing Content-Security-Policy and allow execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. This issue has been patched in version 12.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32686", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nKiwitcms\u00bbKiwi TcmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 12.2cpe:2.3:a:kiwitcms:kiwi_tcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-02  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-26  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-06-03  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-x7c2-7wvg-jpx7", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via unrestricted files upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi \u00b7 GitHubMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/05/22/kiwi-tcms-123/", "ref_desc": "Kiwi TCMS - Kiwi TCMS 12.3Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
