{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31133", "Description": "Ghost is an app for new-media creators with tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters, and offer paid subscriptions to members. Prior to version 5.46.1, due to a lack of validation when filtering on the public API endpoints, it is possible to reveal private fields via a brute force attack.\n\nGhost(Pro) has already been patched. Maintainers can find no evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch being added. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version below v5.46.1. v5.46.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, add a block for requests to `/ghost/api/content/*` where the `filter` query parameter contains `password` or `email`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31133", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGhost\u00bbGhost\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.46.1cpe:2.3:a:ghost:ghost:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-09  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-14  0.09%  0.14%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-04-07  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/security/advisories/GHSA-r97q-ghch-82j9", "ref_desc": "Information disclosure of private API fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 TryGhost/Ghost \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/commit/b3caf16005289cc9909488391b4a26f3f4a66a90", "ref_desc": "\ud83d\udd12 Fixed filtering on private Author fields in Content API \u00b7 TryGhost/Ghost@b3caf16 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases/tag/v5.46.1", "ref_desc": "Release 5.46.1 \u00b7 TryGhost/Ghost \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
