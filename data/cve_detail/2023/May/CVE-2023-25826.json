{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25826", "Description": "Due to insufficient validation of parameters passed to the legacy HTTP query API, it is possible to inject crafted OS commands into multiple parameters and execute malicious code on the OpenTSDB host system. This exploit exists due to an incomplete fix that was made when this vulnerability was previously disclosed as CVE-2020-35476. Regex validation that was implemented to restrict allowed input to the query API does not work as intended, allowing crafted commands to bypass validation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25826", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpentsdb\u00bbOpentsdbVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.4.1cpe:2.3:a:opentsdb:opentsdb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-23  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-04  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-09  0.06%  0.13%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-04-02  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 6  2023-09-09  0.09%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-05-11  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174570/OpenTSDB-2.4.1-Unauthenticated-Command-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "OpenTSDB 2.4.1 Unauthenticated Command Injection \u2248 Packet StormCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/AebGcfgChW_LUAriZtylQIDIbnM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/opentsdb/", "ref_desc": "CyRC Vulnerability Advisory: CVE-2023-25826 and CVE-2023-25827 in OpenTSDB | SynopsysThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Iqgth1AqWjmn2E0ZiFW5CipjTq0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/pull/2275", "ref_desc": "Improved fix for #2261. by manolama \u00b7 Pull Request #2275 \u00b7 OpenTSDB/opentsdb \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
