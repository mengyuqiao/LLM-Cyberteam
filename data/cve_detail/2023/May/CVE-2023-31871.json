{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31871", "Description": "OpenText Documentum Content Server before 23.2 has a flaw that allows for privilege escalation from a non-privileged Documentum user to root. The software comes prepackaged with a root owned SUID binary dm_secure_writer. The binary has security controls in place preventing creation of a file in a non-owned directory, or as the root user. However, these controls can be carefully bypassed to allow for an arbitrary file write as root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31871", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOpentext\u00bbDocumentum Content ServerVersions  before (<) 23.2cpe:2.3:a:opentext:documentum_content_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/picar0jsu/a8e623639da34f36202ce5e436668de7", "ref_desc": "OpenText Documentum Content Server < 23.2 SUID Local Privilege Escalation \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
