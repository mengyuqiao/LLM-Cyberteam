{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31123", "Description": "`effectindex/tripreporter` is a community-powered, universal platform for submitting and analyzing trip reports. Prior to commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b, any user with an account on an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, e.g. `subjective.report`, may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability. The vulnerability allows any user with a password matching the password requirements to log in as any user. This allows access to accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is patched in commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b. No action necessary for users of `subjective.report`, and anyone running their own instance should update to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a workaround, someone running their own instance may apply the patch manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31123", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nEffectindex\u00bbTripreporterVersions  before (<) 2023-04-30cpe:2.3:a:effectindex:tripreporter:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-09  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-14  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-07  0.08%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-16  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/commit/bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b", "ref_desc": "api: (account) Fix improper password verification \u00b7 effectindex/tripreporter@bd80ba8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/security/advisories/GHSA-356r-rwp8-h6m6", "ref_desc": "Improper password verification on POST `/api/v1/account/login` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 effectindex/tripreporter \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
