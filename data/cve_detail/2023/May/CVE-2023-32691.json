{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32691", "Description": "gost (GO Simple Tunnel) is a simple tunnel written in golang. Sensitive secrets such as passwords, token and API keys should be compared only using a constant-time comparison function. Untrusted input, sourced from a HTTP header, is compared directly with a secret. Since this comparison is not secure, an attacker can mount a side-channel timing attack to guess the password. As a workaround, this can be easily fixed using a constant time comparing function such as `crypto/subtle`'s `ConstantTimeCompare`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32691", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGo Simple Tunnel Project\u00bbGo Simple Tunnel\u00bbForGOVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.11.5cpe:2.3:a:go_simple_tunnel_project:go_simple_tunnel:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.13%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-29  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-06  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost/security/advisories/GHSA-qjrq-hm79-49ww", "ref_desc": "Timing Attack in ginuerzh/gost \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ginuerzh/gost \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ginuerzh/gost/blob/1c62376e0880e4094bd3731e06bd4f7842638f6a/auth.go#L46", "ref_desc": "gost/auth.go at 1c62376e0880e4094bd3731e06bd4f7842638f6a \u00b7 ginuerzh/gost \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
