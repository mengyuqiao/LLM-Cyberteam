{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30551", "Description": "Rekor is an open source software supply chain transparency log. Rekor prior to version 1.1.1 may crash due to out of memory (OOM) conditions caused by reading archive metadata files into memory without checking their sizes first. Verification of a JAR file submitted to Rekor can cause an out of memory crash if files within the META-INF directory of the JAR are sufficiently large. Parsing of an APK file submitted to Rekor can cause an out of memory crash if the .SIGN or .PKGINFO files within the APK are sufficiently large. The OOM crash has been patched in Rekor version 1.1.1. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30551", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbRekorVersions  before (<) 1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:rekor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-09  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-05-14  0.07%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-04-07  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-13  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/commit/cf42ace82667025fe128f7a50cf6b4cdff51cc48", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2h5h-59f5-c5x9 \u00b7 sigstore/rekor@cf42ace \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/releases/tag/v1.1.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.1.1 \u00b7 sigstore/rekor \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/security/advisories/GHSA-2h5h-59f5-c5x9", "ref_desc": "Compressed archives can result in OOM conditions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sigstore/rekor \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
