{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24826", "Description": "RIOT-OS, an operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2023.04, an attacker can send crafted frames to the device to trigger the usage of an uninitialized object leading to denial of service. This issue is fixed in version 2023.04. As a workaround, disable fragment forwarding or SFR.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24826", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRiot-os\u00bbRiotVersions  before (<) 2023.04cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.46%  0.50%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.38%  0.46%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-06-05  0.22%  0.38%  +0.17 \n 4  2023-06-07  0.05%  0.22%  +0.17 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/824/Access-of-Uninitialized-Pointer.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/ccbb304eae7b59e8aca24a6ffd095b5b3f7720ee/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/sfr/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_sfr.c#L420", "ref_desc": "RIOT/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_sfr.c at ccbb304eae7b59e8aca24a6ffd095b5b3f7720ee \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/287f030af20e829469cdf740606148018a5a220d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xfj4-9g7w-f4gh \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT@287f030 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-xfj4-9g7w-f4gh", "ref_desc": "Usage of Uninitialized Timer during forwarding of Fragments with SFR \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/ccbb304eae7b59e8aca24a6ffd095b5b3f7720ee/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/sfr/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_sfr.c#L402", "ref_desc": "RIOT/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_sfr.c at ccbb304eae7b59e8aca24a6ffd095b5b3f7720ee \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
