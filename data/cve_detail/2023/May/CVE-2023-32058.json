{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32058", "Description": "Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, due to missing overflow check for loop variables, by assigning the iterator of a loop to a variable, it is possible to overflow the type of the latter. The issue seems to happen only in loops of type `for i in range(a, a + N)` as in loops of type `for i in range(start, stop)` and `for i in range(stop)`, the compiler is able to raise a `TypeMismatch` when trying to overflow the variable. The problem has been patched in version 0.3.8.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32058", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyperVersions  before (<) 0.3.8cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-12  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-05-17  0.06%  0.09%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-04-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-23  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj", "ref_desc": "Integer overflow for loops of form `for i in range(x, x+N)` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/3de1415ee77a9244eb04bdb695e249d3ec9ed868", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@3de1415 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/op0dN1jBdDllOhPPXnpfFbH1YrU.html"}]}
