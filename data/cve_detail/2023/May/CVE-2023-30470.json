{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30470", "Description": "A use-after-free related to unsound inference in the bytecode generation when optimizations are enabled for Hermes prior to commit da8990f737ebb9d9810633502f65ed462b819c09 could have been used by an attacker to achieve remote code execution. Note that this is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30470", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermes\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.72% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.73%  0.72%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-19  0.64%  0.73%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-05-24  0.33%  0.64%  +0.32 \n 4  2024-04-17  0.24%  0.33%  +0.09 \n 5  2023-05-27  0.05%  0.24%  +0.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2023-30470", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-30470Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/da8990f737ebb9d9810633502f65ed462b819c09", "ref_desc": "Treat usages of arguments.callee as unknown callsites \u00b7 facebook/hermes@da8990f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
