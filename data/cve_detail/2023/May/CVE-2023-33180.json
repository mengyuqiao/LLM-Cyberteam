{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33180", "Description": "Xibo is a content management system (CMS). An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered starting in version 3.2.0 and prior to version 3.3.2 in the `/display/map` API route inside the CMS. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the `bounds` parameter. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.5, which fixes this issue. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33180", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nXibosignage\u00bbXiboVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.3.5cpe:2.3:a:xibosignage:xibo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.24%  0.23%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-06-05  0.09%  0.24%  +0.15 \n 3  2024-04-29  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-06-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard", "ref_desc": "XIoT Vulnerability Disclosure Dashboard | ClarotyThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jOVzTHM1LBQneZ00Paagv7kQaic.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/security/advisories/GHSA-7ww5-x9rm-qm89", "ref_desc": "Sensitive Information Disclosure abusing SQL Injection in Xibo CMS display map \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xibosignage/xibo-cms \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://xibosignage.com/blog/security-advisory-2023-05/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory - 5 issues affecting the CMSVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ucMEy9Q_B_La8t0JD1PV29_oOuw.html"}]}
