{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32315", "Description": "Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License. Openfire's administrative console, a web-based application, was found to be vulnerable to a path traversal attack via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated user to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already configured Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console reserved for administrative users. This vulnerability affects all versions of Openfire that have been released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. The problem has been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further improvements will be included in the yet-to-be released first version on the 4.8 branch (which is expected to be version 4.8.0). Users are advised to upgrade. If an Openfire upgrade isn\u2019t available for a specific release, or isn\u2019t quickly actionable, users may see the linked github advisory (GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm) for mitigation advice.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32315", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nIgniterealtime\u00bbOpenfireVersions  from including (>=) 3.10.0andbefore (<) 4.6.8cpe:2.3:a:igniterealtime:openfire:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIgniterealtime\u00bbOpenfireVersions  from including (>=) 4.7.0.andbefore (<) 4.7.5cpe:2.3:a:igniterealtime:openfire:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "97.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-03  97.34%  97.34%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-18  97.33%  97.34%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-11-05  97.35%  97.33%  -0.02 \n 4  2024-10-23  97.32%  97.35%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-10-09  97.15%  97.32%  +0.17 \n 6  2024-09-12  97.02%  97.15%  +0.13 \n 7  2024-08-17  97.06%  97.02%  -0.03 \n 8  2024-08-04  97.36%  97.06%  -0.31 \n 9  2024-07-22  97.36%  97.36%  +0.01 \n 10  2024-07-09  97.36%  97.36%  0.00 \n 11  2024-06-27  97.35%  97.36%  +0.01 \n 12  2024-06-01  97.41%  97.35%  -0.06 \n 13  2024-04-25  97.37%  97.41%  +0.04 \n 14  2024-04-14  97.38%  97.37%  -0.02 \n 15  2024-03-09  97.40%  97.38%  -0.01 \n 16  2024-02-27  97.39%  97.40%  +0.01 \n 17  2024-02-07  96.64%  97.39%  +0.75 \n 18  2024-02-05  96.33%  96.64%  +0.31 \n 19  2024-01-23  96.35%  96.33%  -0.02 \n 20  2024-01-12  96.45%  96.35%  -0.10 \n 21  2024-01-02  96.33%  96.45%  +0.12 \n 22  2023-12-20  96.15%  96.33%  +0.18 \n 23  2023-12-01  95.75%  96.15%  +0.40 \n 24  2023-11-06  95.40%  95.75%  +0.35 \n 25  2023-10-29  96.07%  95.40%  -0.67 \n 26  2023-09-28  96.08%  96.07%  -0.01 \n 27  2023-09-22  97.32%  96.08%  -1.24 \n 28  2023-09-10  97.34%  97.32%  -0.02 \n 29  2023-09-06  96.22%  97.34%  +1.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire/security/advisories/GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm", "ref_desc": "Administration Console authentication bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 igniterealtime/Openfire \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173607/Openfire-Authentication-Bypass-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Openfire Authentication Bypass / Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
