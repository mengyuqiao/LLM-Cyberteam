{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33199", "Description": "Rekor's goals are to provide an immutable tamper resistant ledger of metadata generated within a software projects supply chain. A malformed proposed entry of the `intoto/v0.0.2` type can cause a panic on a thread within the Rekor process. The thread is recovered so the client receives a 500 error message and service still continues, so the availability impact of this is minimal. This has been fixed in v1.2.0 of Rekor. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33199", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbRekorVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:rekor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-06  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-617 Reachable Assertion", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/617/Reachable-Assertion.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/security/advisories/GHSA-frqx-jfcm-6jjr", "ref_desc": "malformed proposed intoto v0.0.2 entries can cause a panic \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sigstore/rekor \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/commit/140c5add105179e5ffd9e3e114fd1b6b93aebbd4", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-frqx-jfcm-6jjr \u00b7 sigstore/rekor@140c5ad \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
