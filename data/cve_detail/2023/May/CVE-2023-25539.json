{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25539", "Description": "Dell NetWorker 19.6.1.2, contains an OS command injection Vulnerability in the NetWorker client. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the application's underlying OS, with the privileges of the vulnerable application. This is a high severity vulnerability as the exploitation allows an attacker to take complete control of a system, so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25539", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbNetworkerVersions  before (<) 19.7.0.4cpe:2.3:a:dell:networker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A\nDell\u00bbNetworker\u00bbVersion:19.7.1cpe:2.3:a:dell:networker:19.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.28%  0.28%  0.00 \n 2  2024-09-04  0.28%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-07-02  0.33%  0.28%  -0.05 \n 4  2024-06-06  0.17%  0.33%  +0.16 \n 5  2024-04-30  0.18%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-07-15  0.25%  0.18%  -0.07 \n 7  2023-07-08  0.18%  0.25%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-06-08  0.05%  0.18%  +0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000211267/dsa-2023-060-dell-networker-security-update-for-an-nsrcapinfo-vulnerability", "ref_desc": "Access DeniedVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
