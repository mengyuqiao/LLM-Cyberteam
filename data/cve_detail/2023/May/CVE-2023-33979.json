{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33979", "Description": "gpt_academic provides a graphical interface for ChatGPT/GLM. A vulnerability was found in gpt_academic 3.37 and prior. This issue affects some unknown processing of the component Configuration File Handler. The manipulation of the argument file leads to information disclosure. Since no sensitive files are configured to be off-limits, sensitive information files in some working directories can be read through the `/file` route, leading to sensitive information leakage. This affects users that uses file configurations via `config.py`, `config_private.py`, `Dockerfile`. A patch is available at commit 1dcc2873d2168ad2d3d70afcb453ac1695fbdf02. As a workaround, one may use environment variables instead of `config*.py` files to configure this project, or use docker-compose installation to configure this project.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33979", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGpt Academic Project\u00bbGpt AcademicVersions  before (<) 3.37cpe:2.3:a:gpt_academic_project:gpt_academic:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-23  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-06  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-30  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic/commit/1dcc2873d2168ad2d3d70afcb453ac1695fbdf02", "ref_desc": "\u4fee\u590dGradio\u914d\u7f6e\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u95ee\u9898 \u00b7 binary-husky/gpt_academic@1dcc287 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic/security/advisories/GHSA-pg65-p24m-wf5g", "ref_desc": "gpt_academic Configuration File File Information Disclosure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 binary-husky/gpt_academic \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
