{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34088", "Description": "Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in Collabora Online prior to versions 22.05.13, 21.11.9.1, and 6.4.27. An attacker could create a document with an XSS payload as a document name. Later, if an administrator opened the admin console and navigated to the history page, the document name was injected as unescaped HTML and executed as a script inside the context of the admin console. The administrator JSON web token (JWT) used for the websocket connection could be leaked through this flaw. Users should upgrade to Collabora Online 22.05.13 or higher; Collabora Online 21.11.9.1 or higher; Collabora Online 6.4.27 or higher to receive a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34088", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCollaboraoffice\u00bbCollabora OnlineVersions  from including (>=) 22.0andbefore (<) 22.05.13cpe:2.3:a:collaboraoffice:collabora_online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCollaboraoffice\u00bbCollabora OnlineVersions  before (<) 6.4.27cpe:2.3:a:collaboraoffice:collabora_online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCollaboraoffice\u00bbCollabora OnlineVersions  from including (>=) 21.0andbefore (<) 21.11.9.1cpe:2.3:a:collaboraoffice:collabora_online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 17 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-06-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/security/advisories/GHSA-7582-pwfh-3pwr", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-34088 Stored Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in admin interface \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 CollaboraOnline/online \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
