{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31126", "Description": "`org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml` is an XML library used by the open-source wiki platform XWiki. The HTML sanitizer, introduced in version 14.6-rc-1, allows the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid data attributes. This vulnerability does not affect restricted cleaning in HTMLCleaner as there attributes are cleaned and thus characters like `/` and `>` are removed in all attribute names. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by making sure that data attributes only contain allowed characters. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31126", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.6andbefore (<) 14.10.4cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-19  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-10  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-15  0.10%  0.21%  +0.12 \n 5  2024-04-08  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-17  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-86 Improper Neutralization of Invalid Characters in Identifiers in Web Pages", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/86/Improper-Neutralization-of-Invalid-Characters-in-Identifiers.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/0b8e9c45b7e7457043938f35265b2aa5adc76a68", "ref_desc": "XCOMMONS-2606: Properly validate data attributes in SecureHTMLElement\u2026 \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-commons@0b8e9c4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2606", "ref_desc": "[XCOMMONS-2606] HTML element sanitizer accepts invalid data attributes, allowing XSS - XWiki.org JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/security/advisories/GHSA-pv7v-ph6g-3gxv", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Invalid Characters in Data Attribute Names in org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-commons \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
