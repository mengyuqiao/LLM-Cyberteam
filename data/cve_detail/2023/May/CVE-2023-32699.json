{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32699", "Description": "MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform. Version 2.9.1 and prior are vulnerable to denial of service. ?The `checkUserPassword` method is used to check whether the password provided by the user matches the password saved in the database, and the `CodingUtil.md5` method is used to encrypt the original password with MD5 to ensure that the password will not be saved in plain text when it is stored. If a user submits a very long password when logging in, the system will be forced to execute the long password MD5 encryption process, causing the server CPU and memory to be exhausted, thereby causing a denial of service attack on the server. This issue is fixed in version 2.10.0-lts with a maximum password length.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32699", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nMetersphere\u00bbMetersphereVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.9.1cpe:2.3:a:metersphere:metersphere:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-05  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-04-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-06  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/commit/c59e381d368990214813085a1a4877c5ef865411", "ref_desc": "refactor(\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e): \u767b\u5f55\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4fe1\u606f\u957f\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1 \u00b7 metersphere/metersphere@c59e381 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-qffq-8gf8-mhq7", "ref_desc": "metersphere\u5b58\u5728DoS\u6f0f\u6d1e \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 metersphere/metersphere \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
