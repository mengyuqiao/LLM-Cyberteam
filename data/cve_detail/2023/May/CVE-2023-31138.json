{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31138", "Description": "DHIS2 Core contains the service layer and Web API for DHIS2, an information system for data capture. Starting in the 2.36 branch and prior to versions 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, and 2.39.1.2, using object model traversal in the payload of a PATCH request, authenticated users with write access to an object may be able to modify related objects that they should not have access to. DHIS2 implementers should upgrade to a supported version of DHIS2 to receive a patch: 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, or 2.39.1.2. It is possible to work around this issue by blocking all PATCH requests on a reverse proxy, but this may cause some issues with the functionality of built-in applications using legacy PATCH requests.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31138", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.39.0andbefore (<) 2.39.1.2cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.36.0andbefore (<) 2.37.9.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDhis2\u00bbDhis 2Versions  from including (>=) 2.38.0andbefore (<) 2.38.3.1cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-15  0.08%  0.17%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-04-08  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-releases/blob/master/releases/2.38/ReleaseNote-2.38.3.1.md", "ref_desc": "dhis2-releases/ReleaseNote-2.38.3.1.md at master \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-releases \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DwZviHyy1dzFa3_Bhm_p5tRVbSc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-core/security/advisories/GHSA-pwvw-4m67-f4g2", "ref_desc": "Improper access control with PATCH requests \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-core \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-releases/blob/master/releases/2.37/ReleaseNote-2.37.9.1.md", "ref_desc": "dhis2-releases/ReleaseNote-2.37.9.1.md at master \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-releases \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jjE4hdE7xnAbCdcUtI01ygl78wo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-releases/blob/master/releases/2.39/ReleaseNote-2.39.1.2.md", "ref_desc": "dhis2-releases/ReleaseNote-2.39.1.2.md at master \u00b7 dhis2/dhis2-releases \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lbt9Ogbuan9lC3PYGA-Vw_Aj7ak.html"}]}
