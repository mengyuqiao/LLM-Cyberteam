{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32348", "Description": "Teltonika\u2019s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 contain a virtual private network (VPN) hub feature for cross-device communication that uses OpenVPN. It connects new devices in a manner that allows the new device to communicate with all Teltonika devices connected to the VPN. The OpenVPN server also allows users to route through it. An attacker could route a connection to a remote server through the OpenVPN server, enabling them to scan and access data from other Teltonika devices connected to the VPN.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32348", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nTeltonika\u00bbRemote Management SystemVersions  before (<) 4.10.0cpe:2.3:a:teltonika:remote_management_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-01  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-23  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 3  2024-05-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-06-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-131-08", "ref_desc": "Teltonika Remote Management System and RUT Model Routers | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wzOfaBL9cQf__UzTEpjcXalFLNI.html"}]}
