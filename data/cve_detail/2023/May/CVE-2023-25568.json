{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25568", "Description": "Boxo, formerly known as go-libipfs, is a library for building IPFS applications and implementations. In versions 0.4.0 and 0.5.0, if an attacker is able allocate arbitrary many bytes in the Bitswap server, those allocations are lasting even if the connection is closed. This affects users accepting untrusted connections with the Bitswap server and also affects users using the old API stubs at `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap` because users then transitively import `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/server`. Boxo versions 0.6.0 and 0.4.1 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, those who are using the stub object at `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap` not taking advantage of the features provided by the server can refactor their code to use the new split API that will allow them to run in a client only mode: `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/client`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25568", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nProtocol\u00bbBoxo\u00bbVersion:0.5.0ForGOcpe:2.3:a:protocol:boxo:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions\nProtocol\u00bbBoxo\u00bbVersion:0.4.0ForGOcpe:2.3:a:protocol:boxo:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-30  0.18%  0.18%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.17%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-11  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-16  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-04-09  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-05-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/commit/62cbac40b96f49e39cd7fedc77ee6b56adce4916", "ref_desc": "bitswap/server/internal/decision: add filtering on CIDs \u00b7 ipfs/boxo@62cbac4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/security/advisories/GHSA-m974-xj4j-7qv5", "ref_desc": "bitswap/server: DOS unbounded persistant memory leak \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ipfs/boxo \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/commit/baa748b682fabb21a4c1f7628a8af348d4645974", "ref_desc": "bitswap/server/internal/decision: add more non flaky tests \u00b7 ipfs/boxo@baa748b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/commit/9cb5cb54d40b57084d1221ba83b9e6bb3fcc3197", "ref_desc": "bitswap/server/internal/decision: rewrite ledger inversion \u00b7 ipfs/boxo@9cb5cb5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
