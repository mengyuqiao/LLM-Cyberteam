{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33178", "Description": "Xibo is a content management system (CMS). An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the `/dataset/data/{id}` API route inside the CMS starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to versions 2.3.17 and 3.3.5. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the `filter` parameter. Values allowed in the filter parameter are checked against a deny list of commands that should not be allowed, however this checking was done in a case sensitive manor and so it is possible to bypass these checks by using unusual case combinations. Users should upgrade to version 2.3.17 or 3.3.5, which fix this issue. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33178", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nXibosignage\u00bbXiboVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.3.5cpe:2.3:a:xibosignage:xibo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXibosignage\u00bbXiboVersions  from including (>=) 1.4.0andbefore (<) 2.3.17cpe:2.3:a:xibosignage:xibo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-05  0.07%  0.17%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-06-06  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard", "ref_desc": "XIoT Vulnerability Disclosure Dashboard | ClarotyThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jOVzTHM1LBQneZ00Paagv7kQaic.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/security/advisories/GHSA-g9x2-757j-hmhh", "ref_desc": "Sensitive Information Disclosure abusing SQL Injection in Xibo CMS dataset filter \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xibosignage/xibo-cms \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://xibosignage.com/blog/security-advisory-2023-05/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory - 5 issues affecting the CMSVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ucMEy9Q_B_La8t0JD1PV29_oOuw.html"}]}
