{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32323", "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. A malicious user on a Synapse homeserver X with permission to create certain state events can disable outbound federation from X to an arbitrary homeserver Y. Synapse instances with federation disabled are not affected. In versions of Synapse up to and including 1.73, Synapse did not limit the size of `invite_room_state`, meaning that it was possible to create an arbitrarily large invite event. Synapse 1.74 refuses to create oversized `invite_room_state` fields. Server operators should upgrade to Synapse 1.74 or newer urgently.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32323", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  before (<) 1.74.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-09-18  0.08%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-06-03  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-f3wc-3vxv-xmvr", "ref_desc": "Outgoing federation to specific hosts can be disabled by sending malicious invites \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UJIJRP5ZH6B3KGFLHCAKR2IX2Y4Z25QD/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: python-matrix-common-1.3.0-7.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bHjnU-vRbxubCoGv--1Y7oGiKOM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14642", "ref_desc": "Allow selecting \"prejoin\" events by state keys by DMRobertson \u00b7 Pull Request #14642 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14492", "ref_desc": "Federation was broken between my homeserver and matrix.org (and I fixed it with this patch) \u00b7 Issue #14492 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
