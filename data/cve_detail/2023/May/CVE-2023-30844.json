{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30844", "Description": "Mutagen provides real-time file synchronization and flexible network forwarding for developers. Prior to versions 0.16.6 and 0.17.1 in `mutagen` and prior to version 0.17.1 in `mutagen-compose`, Mutagen `list` and `monitor` commands are susceptible to control characters that could be provided by remote endpoints.  This could cause terminal corruption, either intentional or unintentional, if these characters were present in error messages or file paths/names. This could be used as an attack vector if synchronizing with an untrusted remote endpoint, synchronizing files not under control of the user, or forwarding to/from an untrusted remote endpoint.  On very old systems with terminals susceptible to issues such as CVE-2003-0069, the issue could theoretically cause code execution. The problem has been patched in Mutagen v0.16.6 and v0.17.1.  Earlier versions of Mutagen are no longer supported and will not be patched.  Versions of Mutagen after v0.18.0 will also have the patch merged. As a workaround, avoiding synchronization of untrusted files or interaction with untrusted remote endpoints should mitigate any risk.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30844", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMutagen\u00bbMutagen ComposeVersions  before (<) 0.17.1cpe:2.3:a:mutagen:mutagen_compose:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMutagen\u00bbMutagenVersions  before (<) 0.16.6cpe:2.3:a:mutagen:mutagen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMutagen\u00bbMutagen\u00bbVersion:0.17.0cpe:2.3:a:mutagen:mutagen:0.17.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.26%  0.26%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-14  0.09%  0.25%  +0.16 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-03-14  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-05-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-150 Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/150/Improper-Neutralization-of-Escape-Meta-or-Control-Sequence.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/releases/tag/v0.16.6", "ref_desc": "Release v0.16.6 \u00b7 mutagen-io/mutagen \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/releases/tag/v0.17.1", "ref_desc": "Release v0.17.1 \u00b7 mutagen-io/mutagen \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/security/advisories/GHSA-jmp2-wc4p-wfh2", "ref_desc": "Mutagen command line and logging operations do not neutralize control characters in text controlled by remote endpoints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mutagen-io/mutagen \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
