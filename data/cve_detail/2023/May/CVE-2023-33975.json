{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33975", "Description": "RIOT-OS, an operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. In version 2023.01 and prior, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in an out of bounds write in the packet buffer. The overflow can be used to corrupt other packets and the allocator metadata. Corrupting a pointer will easily lead to denial of service. While carefully manipulating the allocator metadata gives an attacker the possibility to write data to arbitrary locations and thus execute arbitrary code. This issue is fixed in pull request 19680. As a workaround, disable support for fragmented IP datagrams.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33975", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nRiot-os\u00bbRiotVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2023.01cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.58%  0.66%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-09-03  0.52%  0.58%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-07-01  0.44%  0.52%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-06-05  0.20%  0.44%  +0.24 \n 5  2024-04-29  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-06-08  0.04%  0.17%  +0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/19680", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb: fix OOB write in _rbuf_add by miri64 \u00b7 Pull Request #19680 \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/rb/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb.c#L463", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/rb/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb.c#L480", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/rb/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb.c#L320", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-f6ff-g7mh-58q4", "ref_desc": "Out of Bounds Write in _rbuf_add \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/rb/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb.c#L388", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/rb/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb.c#L467", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/1aeb90ee5555ae78b567a6365ae4ab71bfd1404b", "ref_desc": "gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_rb: fix OOB write in _rbuf_add \u00b7 RIOT-OS/RIOT@1aeb90e \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
