{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33966", "Description": "Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. In deno 1.34.0 and deno_runtime 0.114.0, outbound HTTP requests made using the built-in `node:http` or `node:https` modules are incorrectly not checked against the network permission allow list (`--allow-net`). Dependencies relying on these built-in modules are subject to the vulnerability too. Users of Deno versions prior to 1.34.0 are unaffected. Deno Deploy users are unaffected. This problem has been patched in Deno v1.34.1 and deno_runtime 0.114.1 and all users are recommended to update to this version. No workaround is available for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33966", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDeno\u00bbDeno\u00bbVersion:1.34.0cpe:2.3:a:deno:deno:1.34.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDeno\u00bbDeno Runtime\u00bbVersion:0.114.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:deno:deno_runtime:0.114.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.27%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-07-02  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-06  0.13%  0.24%  +0.11 \n 4  2024-04-30  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-06-08  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-vc52-gwm3-8v2f", "ref_desc": "Missing \"--allow-net\" permission check for built-in Node modules \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.34.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.34.1 \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
