{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32675", "Description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In contracts with more than one regular nonpayable function, it is possible to send funds to the default function, even if the default function is marked `nonpayable`. This applies to contracts compiled with vyper versions prior to 0.3.8. This issue was fixed by the removal of the global `calldatasize` check in commit `02339dfda`. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.8. Users unable to upgrade should avoid use of nonpayable default functions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32675", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyperVersions  before (<) 0.3.8cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-25  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-04-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-vxmm-cwh2-q762", "ref_desc": "nonpayable default functions can sometimes be sent ether with calldatasize<4 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/02339dfda0f3caabad142060d511d10bfe93c520", "ref_desc": "refactor: optimize calldatasize check (#3104) \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper@02339df \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/02339dfda0f3caabad142060d511d10bfe93c520.", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubBroken Link;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
