{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32681", "Description": "Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPython\u00bbRequestsVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.31.0cpe:2.3:a:python:requests:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.27%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-08-30  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-11  0.15%  0.24%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-06-27  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-06-01  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-05-07  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 7  2024-04-25  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 8  2024-02-27  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 9  2023-09-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-07-23  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 11  2023-06-19  0.08%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 12  2023-06-03  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/psf/requests/releases/tag/v2.31.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.31.0 \u00b7 psf/requests \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/74ea7cf7a6a27a4eeb2ae24e162bcc942a6706d5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q \u00b7 psf/requests@74ea7cf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AW7HNFGYP44RT3DUDQXG2QT3OEV2PJ7Y/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: python-requests-2.28.1-3.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KOYASTZDGQG2BWLSNBPL3TQRL2G7QYNZ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: mingw-python-requests-2.31.0-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00018.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3456-1] requests security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-08", "ref_desc": "Requests: Information Leak (GLSA 202309-08) \u2014 Gentoo security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q", "ref_desc": "Unintended leak of Proxy-Authorization header \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 psf/requests \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
