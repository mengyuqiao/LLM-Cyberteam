{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30851", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. This issue only impacts users who have a HTTP policy that applies to multiple `toEndpoints` AND have an allow-all rule in place that affects only one of those endpoints. In such cases, a wildcard rule will be appended to the set of HTTP rules, which could cause bypass of HTTP policies. This issue has been patched in Cilium 1.11.16, 1.12.9, and 1.13.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30851", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  before (<) 1.11.16cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.9cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.2cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-05-31  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-06-02  0.13%  0.06%  -0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.13.2", "ref_desc": "Release 1.13.2 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-2h44-x2wx-49f4", "ref_desc": "Potential HTTP policy bypass when using header rules \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.11.16", "ref_desc": "Release 1.11.16 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.12.9", "ref_desc": "Release 1.12.9 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
