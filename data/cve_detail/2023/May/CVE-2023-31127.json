{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31127", "Description": "libspdm is a sample implementation that follows the DMTF SPDM specifications. A vulnerability has been identified in SPDM session establishment in libspdm prior to version 2.3.1. If a device supports both DHE session and PSK session with mutual\nauthentication, the attacker may be able to establish the session with `KEY_EXCHANGE` and `PSK_FINISH` to bypass the mutual authentication. This is most likely to happen when the Requester begins a session using one method (DHE, for example) and then uses the other method's finish (PSK_FINISH in this example) to establish the session. The session hashes would be expected to fail in this case, but the condition was not detected.\n\nThis issue only impacts the SPDM responder, which supports `KEY_EX_CAP=1 and `PSK_CAP=10b` at same time with mutual authentication requirement. The SPDM requester is not impacted. The SPDM responder is not impacted if `KEY_EX_CAP=0` or `PSK_CAP=0` or `PSK_CAP=01b`. The SPDM responder is not impacted if mutual authentication is not required.\n\nlibspdm 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 are all impacted. Older branches are not maintained, but users of the 2.3 branch may receive a patch in version 2.3.2. The SPDM specification (DSP0274) does not contain this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31127", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDmtf\u00bbLibspdmVersions  before (<) 2.3.2cpe:2.3:a:dmtf:libspdm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-14  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-04-07  0.07%  0.06%  0.00 \n 5  2024-03-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-372 Incomplete Internal State Distinction", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/372/Incomplete-Internal-State-Distinction.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DMTF/libspdm/pull/2006", "ref_desc": "Add handshake mode switch check in FINISH and PSK_FINISH. by jyao1 \u00b7 Pull Request #2006 \u00b7 DMTF/libspdm \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DMTF/libspdm/security/advisories/GHSA-qw76-4v8p-xq9f", "ref_desc": "DMTF-2023-0001: SPDM mutual authentication bypass \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DMTF/libspdm \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DMTF/libspdm/pull/2007", "ref_desc": "Add handshake mode switch check in FINISH and PSK_FINISH. by jyao1 \u00b7 Pull Request #2007 \u00b7 DMTF/libspdm \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
