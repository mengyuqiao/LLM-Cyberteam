{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33192", "Description": "ntpd-rs is an NTP implementation written in Rust. ntpd-rs does not validate the length of NTS cookies in received NTP packets to the server. An attacker can crash the server by sending a specially crafted NTP packet containing a cookie shorter than what the server expects. The server also crashes when it is not configured to handle NTS packets. The issue was caused by improper slice indexing. The indexing operations were replaced by safer alternatives that do not crash the ntpd-rs server process but instead properly handle the error condition. A patch was released in version 0.3.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33192", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTweedegolf\u00bbNtpd-rs\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.3.0andbefore (<) 0.3.3cpe:2.3:a:tweedegolf:ntpd-rs:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-06  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-28  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-02  0.07%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 4  2024-04-26  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-06-03  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-130 Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/130/Improper-Handling-of-Length-Parameter-Inconsistency.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-qwhm-h7v3-mrjx", "ref_desc": "Improper handling of NTS cookie length that could crash the ntpd-rs server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pendulum-project/ntpd-rs \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/pull/752", "ref_desc": "Cookie length validation by folkertdev \u00b7 Pull Request #752 \u00b7 pendulum-project/ntpd-rs \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
