{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32676", "Description": "Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments. A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the Install assessment functionality of Autolab. To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Using the install assessment functionality an attacker can feed a Tar file that contain files with paths pointing outside of the target directory (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped1.sh`). When the Install assessment form is submitted the files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-chosen locations. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32676", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nAutolabproject\u00bbAutolabVersions  before (<) 2.11.0cpe:2.3:a:autolabproject:autolab:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.19%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-01  0.09%  0.19%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-01  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-12-12  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-06-06  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-x9hj-r9q4-832c", "ref_desc": "Tar slip in Install Assessment functionality (`GHSL-2023-081`) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 autolab/Autolab \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/commit/14f508484a8323eceb0cf3a128573b43eabbc80d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-x9hj-r9q4-832c \u00b7 autolab/Autolab@14f5084 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-081_GHSL-2023-082_Autolab/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-081_GHSL-2023-082: Tar Slip vulnerabilities in Autolab - CVE-2023-32676, CVE-2023-32317 | GitHub Security LabCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HA86XejRsQZoXlhLcgCcuZOLBLU.html"}]}
