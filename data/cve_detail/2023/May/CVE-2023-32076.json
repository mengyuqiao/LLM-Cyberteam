{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32076", "Description": "in-toto is a framework to protect supply chain integrity. The in-toto configuration is read from various directories and allows users to configure the behavior of the framework. The files are from directories following the XDG base directory specification. In versions 1.4.0 and prior, among the files read is `.in_totorc` which is a hidden file in the directory in which in-toto is run. If an attacker controls the inputs to a supply chain step, they can mask their activities by also passing in an `.in_totorc` file that includes the necessary exclude patterns and settings. RC files are widely used in other systems and security issues have been discovered in their implementations as well. Maintainers found in their conversations with in-toto adopters that `in_totorc` is not their preferred way to configure in-toto. As none of the options supported in `in_totorc` is unique, and can be set elsewhere using API parameters or CLI arguments, the maintainers decided to drop support for `in_totorc`. in-toto's `user_settings` module has been dropped altogether in commit 3a21d84f40811b7d191fa7bd17265c1f99599afd. Users may also sandbox functionary code as a security measure.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32076", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIn-toto Project\u00bbIn-totoVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.4.0cpe:2.3:a:in-toto_project:in-toto:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-15 External Control of System or Configuration Setting", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/15/External-Control-of-System-or-Configuration-Setting.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-610 Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/610/Externally-Controlled-Reference-to-a-Resource-in-Another-Sph.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/security/advisories/GHSA-wc64-c5rv-32pf", "ref_desc": "Configuration Read From Local Directory \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 in-toto/in-toto \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html", "ref_desc": "XDG Base Directory SpecificationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/in-toto/docs/security/advisories/GHSA-p86f-xmg6-9q4x", "ref_desc": "Functionaries Do Not Perform Verification \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 in-toto/docs \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/commit/3a21d84f40811b7d191fa7bd17265c1f99599afd", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wc64-c5rv-32pf \u00b7 in-toto/in-toto@3a21d84 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
