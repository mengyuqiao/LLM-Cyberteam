{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-29195", "Description": "Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL through generalized sharding. Prior to version 16.0.2, users can either intentionally or inadvertently create a shard containing `/` characters from VTAdmin such that from that point on, anyone who tries to create a new shard from VTAdmin will receive an error. Attempting to view the keyspace(s) will also no longer work. Creating a shard using `vtctldclient` does not have the same problem because the CLI validates the input correctly. Version 16.0.2, corresponding to version 0.16.2 of the `go` module, contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Always use `vtctldclient` to create shards, instead of using VTAdmin; disable creating shards from VTAdmin using RBAC; and/or delete the topology record for the offending shard using the client for your topology server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29195", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbVitessVersions  before (<) 16.0.2cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:vitess:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-08-15  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-05-17  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-23  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/703/Improper-Check-or-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/12842", "ref_desc": "Bug Report: CreateShard allows shard names with \"/\", which breaks other commands/components \u00b7 Issue #12842 \u00b7 vitessio/vitess \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/security/advisories/GHSA-pqj7-jx24-wj7w", "ref_desc": "VTAdmin users that can create shards can deny access to other functions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vitessio/vitess \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess@v0.16.2", "ref_desc": "vitess command - vitess.io/vitess - Go PackagesProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12843", "ref_desc": "[topo] Disallow the slash character in shard names by ajm188 \u00b7 Pull Request #12843 \u00b7 vitessio/vitess \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commit/9dcbd7de3180f47e94f54989fb5c66daea00c920", "ref_desc": "Backport: [topo] Disallow the slash character in shard names #12843 (\u2026 \u00b7 vitessio/vitess@9dcbd7d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v16.0.2", "ref_desc": "Release Vitess v16.0.2 \u00b7 vitessio/vitess \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
