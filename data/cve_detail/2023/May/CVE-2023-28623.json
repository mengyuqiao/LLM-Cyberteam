{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28623", "Description": "Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with unique topic-based threading. In the event that 1: `ZulipLDAPAuthBackend` and an external authentication backend (any aside of `ZulipLDAPAuthBackend` and `EmailAuthBackend`) are the only ones enabled in `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` in `/etc/zulip/settings.py` and 2: The organization permissions don't require invitations to join. An attacker can create a new account in the organization with an arbitrary email address in their control that's not in the organization's LDAP directory. The impact is limited to installations which have this specific combination of authentication backends as described above in addition to having `Invitations are required for joining this organization` organization permission disabled. This issue has been addressed in version 6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may enable the `Invitations are required for joining this organization` organization permission to prevent this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28623", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nZulip\u00bbZulipVersions  before (<) 6.2cpe:2.3:a:zulip:zulip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-29  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-05-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/3df1b4dd7c210c21deb6f829df19412b74573f8d", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-28623: Prevent unauthorized signup with ldap + external auth. \u00b7 zulip/zulip@3df1b4d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-7p62-pjwg-56rv", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized user can register an account in specific configurations involving LDAP and another external authentication backend \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zulip/zulip \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
