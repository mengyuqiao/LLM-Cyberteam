{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32306", "Description": "Time Tracker is an open source time tracking system. A time-based blind injection vulnerability existed in Time Tracker reports in versions prior to 1.22.13.5792. This was happening because the `reports.php` page was not validating all parameters in POST requests. Because some parameters were not checked, it was possible to craft POST requests with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database. This issue is fixed in version 1.22.13.5792. As a workaround, use the fixed code in `ttReportHelper.class.php` from version 1.22.13.5792.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32306", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nAnuko\u00bbTime TrackerVersions  before (<) 1.22.13.5792cpe:2.3:a:anuko:time_tracker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.20%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-13  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 4  2024-05-18  0.09%  0.17%  +0.08 \n 5  2023-05-25  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-758x-vg7g-j9j3", "ref_desc": "Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability in Reports \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anuko/timetracker \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
