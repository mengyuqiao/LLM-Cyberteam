{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32068", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In versions prior to 14.10.4 it's possible to exploit well known parameters in XWiki URLs to perform redirection to untrusted site. This vulnerability was partially fixed in the past for XWiki 12.10.7 and 13.3RC1 but there is still the possibility to force specific URLs to skip some checks, e.g. using URLs like `http:example.com` in the parameter would allow the redirect.  The issue has now been patched against all patterns that are known for performing redirects. This issue has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32068", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  before (<) 14.10.4cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:15.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:15.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "26.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  28.33%  26.64%  -1.68 \n 2  2024-10-12  29.96%  28.33%  -1.63 \n 3  2024-06-18  0.12%  29.96%  +29.83 \n 4  2024-06-16  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-21  0.15%  0.12%  -0.03 \n 6  2024-04-14  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 7  2024-01-01  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-11-28  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-05-25  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-6gvj-8vc5-8v3j", "ref_desc": "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20096", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20096] Open Redirect vulnerability discovered in the latest XWiki platform - XWiki.org JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e4f7f68e93cb08c25632c126356d218abf192d1e", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-19994: False positive redirect checking \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@e4f7f68 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20549", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20549] Provide a new script service API to check trustfulness of an URI - XWiki.org JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
