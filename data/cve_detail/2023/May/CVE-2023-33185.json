{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33185", "Description": "Django-SES is a drop-in mail backend for Django. The django_ses library implements a mail backend for Django using AWS Simple Email Service. The library exports the `SESEventWebhookView class` intended to receive signed requests from AWS to handle email bounces, subscriptions, etc. These requests are signed by AWS and are verified by django_ses, however the verification of this signature was found to be flawed as it allowed users to specify arbitrary public certificates. This issue was patched in version 3.5.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33185", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDjango-ses Project\u00bbDjango-sesVersions  before (<) 3.5.0cpe:2.3:a:django-ses_project:django-ses:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-04-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-06-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses/blob/3d627067935876487f9938310d5e1fbb249a7778/CVE/001-cert-url-signature-verification.md", "ref_desc": "django-ses/001-cert-url-signature-verification.md at 3d627067935876487f9938310d5e1fbb249a7778 \u00b7 django-ses/django-ses \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses/commit/b71b5f413293a13997b6e6314086cb9c22629795", "ref_desc": "Restrict amazonaws allowed certificate URLs. \u00b7 django-ses/django-ses@b71b5f4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses/security/advisories/GHSA-qg36-9jxh-fj25", "ref_desc": "Certificate URL: signature verification exposure \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 django-ses/django-ses \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
