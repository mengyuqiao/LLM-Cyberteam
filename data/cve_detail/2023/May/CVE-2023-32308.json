{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32308", "Description": "anuko timetracker is an open source time tracking system. Boolean-based blind SQL injection vulnerability existed in Time Tracker invoices.php in versions prior to 1.22.11.5781. This was happening because of a coding error after validating parameters in POST requests. There was no check for errors before adjusting invoice sorting order. Because of this, it was possible to craft a POST request with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database. This issue has been fixed in version 1.22.11.5781. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may insert an additional check for errors in a condition before calling `ttGroupHelper::getActiveInvoices()` in invoices.php.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32308", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nAnuko\u00bbTime TrackerVersions  before (<) 1.22.11.5781cpe:2.3:a:anuko:time_tracker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-05-21  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-04-14  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-05-26  0.04%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-9g2c-7c7g-p58r", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection Vulnerability in invoices.php \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 anuko/timetracker \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/8a7367d7f77ea697c090f5ca4e19669181cc7bcf", "ref_desc": "Addressed an sql vulnerability in invoices.php for bogus post paramet\u2026 \u00b7 anuko/timetracker@8a7367d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
