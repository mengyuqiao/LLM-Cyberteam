{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32007", "Description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter, this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. A malicious user might then be able to reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on their input, and execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell command execution as the user Spark is currently running as. This issue was disclosed earlier as CVE-2022-33891, but incorrectly claimed version 3.1.3 (which has since gone EOL) would not be affected.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to a supported version of Apache Spark, such as version 3.4.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32007", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSparkVersions  from including (>=) 3.1.1andup to, including, (<=) 3.1.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:spark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbSparkVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.2.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:spark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbSparkVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.0.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:spark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-22  1.27%  0.97%  -0.30 \n 2  2024-08-19  1.48%  1.27%  -0.21 \n 3  2024-05-21  1.95%  1.48%  -0.47 \n 4  2024-05-08  1.14%  1.95%  +0.81 \n 5  2024-04-13  0.46%  1.14%  +0.68 \n 6  2024-02-14  0.33%  0.46%  +0.14 \n 7  2024-02-08  0.36%  0.33%  -0.03 \n 8  2023-07-08  0.42%  0.36%  -0.06 \n 9  2023-06-04  0.29%  0.42%  +0.12 \n 10  2023-05-11  0.05%  0.29%  +0.25 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://spark.apache.org/security.html", "ref_desc": "Security | Apache SparkVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/poxgnxhhnzz735kr1wos366l5vdbb0nv", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-32007: Apache Spark: Shell command injection via Spark UI-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/02/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-32007: Apache Spark: Shell command injection via Spark UIMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/biDybpYVqQMCd8Ds0-POXQuFni4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-33891", "ref_desc": "cve-websiteThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
