{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24832", "Description": "A null pointer dereference bug in Hermes prior to commit 5cae9f72975cf0e5a62b27fdd8b01f103e198708 could have been used by an attacker to crash an Hermes runtime where the EnableHermesInternal config option was set to true. Note that this is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24832", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermesVersions  before (<) 2023-01-31cpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.12%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-19  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-24  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-04-17  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-05-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/5cae9f72975cf0e5a62b27fdd8b01f103e198708", "ref_desc": "Avoid accessing the DebugInfo for BCProviderLazy \u00b7 facebook/hermes@5cae9f7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2023-24832", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-24832Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
