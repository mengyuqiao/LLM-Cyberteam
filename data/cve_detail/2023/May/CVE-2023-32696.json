{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32696", "Description": "CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals. Prior to versions 2.9.9 and 2.10.1, the `ckan` user (equivalent to www-data) owned code and configuration files in the docker container and the `ckan` user had the permissions to use sudo. These issues allowed for code execution or privilege escalation if an arbitrary file write bug was available. Versions 2.9.9, 2.9.9-dev, 2.10.1, and 2.10.1-dev contain a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32696", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOkfn\u00bbCkanVersions  before (<) 2.9.9cpe:2.3:a:okfn:ckan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOkfn\u00bbCkan\u00bbVersion:2.10.0cpe:2.3:a:okfn:ckan:2.10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-09  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-05  0.08%  0.15%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-04-29  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-06-06  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base/security/advisories/GHSA-c74x-xfvr-x5wg", "ref_desc": "Excessive permissions on ckan user \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ckan/ckan-docker-base \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base/commit/5483c46ce9b518a4e1b626ef7032cce2c1d75c7d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-c74x-xfvr-x5wg \u00b7 ckan/ckan-docker-base@5483c46 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
