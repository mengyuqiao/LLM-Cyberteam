{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31129", "Description": "The Contiki-NG operating system versions 4.8 and prior can be triggered to dereference a NULL pointer in the message handling code for IPv6 router solicitiations. Contiki-NG contains an implementation of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) in the module `os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c`. The ND protocol includes a message type called Router Solicitation (RS), which is used to locate routers and update their address information via the SLLAO (Source Link-Layer Address Option). If the indicated source address changes, a given neighbor entry is set to the STALE state.\n\nThe message handler does not check for RS messages with an SLLAO that indicates a link-layer address change that a neighbor entry can actually be created for the indicated address. The resulting pointer is used without a check, leading to the dereference of a NULL pointer of type `uip_ds6_nbr_t`.\n\nThe problem has been patched in the `develop` branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in the upcoming 4.9 release. As a workaround, users can apply Contiki-NG pull request #2271 to patch the problem directly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31129", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.30%  0.31%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.26%  0.30%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-06-09  0.23%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-05-14  0.12%  0.23%  +0.11 \n 5  2024-04-07  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-16  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2271", "ref_desc": "fix rs_input missing NULL pointer check by Scepticz \u00b7 Pull Request #2271 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-x29r-5qjg-75mq", "ref_desc": "Missing NULL pointer check in IPv6 neighbor discovery \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
