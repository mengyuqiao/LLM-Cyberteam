{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27892", "Description": "Insufficient length checks in the ShapeShift KeepKey hardware wallet firmware before 7.7.0 allow a global buffer overflow via crafted messages. Flaws in cf_confirmExecTx() in ethereum_contracts.c can be used to reveal arbitrary microcontroller memory on the device screen or crash the device. With physical access to a PIN-unlocked device, attackers can extract the BIP39 mnemonic secret from the hardware wallet.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27892", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nShapeshift\u00bbKeepkey FirmwareVersions  from including (>=) 7.5.2andbefore (<) 7.7.0cpe:2.3:o:shapeshift:keepkey_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Shapeshift\u00bbKeepkey\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-22  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-11  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blog.inhq.net/posts/keepkey-CVE-2023-27892/", "ref_desc": "KeepKey Memory Exfiltration Vulnerability (CVE-2023-27892) | invd blogExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-firmware/pull/337", "ref_desc": "remove obsolete cfunc code by markrypt0 \u00b7 Pull Request #337 \u00b7 keepkey/keepkey-firmware \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
