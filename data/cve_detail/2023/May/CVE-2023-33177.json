{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33177", "Description": "Xibo is a content management system (CMS). A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Xibo CMS whereby a specially crafted zip file can be uploaded to the CMS via the layout import function by an authenticated user which would allow creation of files outside of the CMS library directory as the webserver user. This can be used to upload a PHP webshell inside the web root directory and achieve remote code execution as the webserver user. Users should upgrade to version 2.3.17 or 3.3.5, which fix this issue. Customers who host their CMS with Xibo Signage have already received an upgrade or patch to resolve this issue regardless of the CMS version that they are running.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33177", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXibosignage\u00bbXiboVersions  from including (>=) 1.8.0andbefore (<) 2.3.17cpe:2.3:a:xibosignage:xibo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXibosignage\u00bbXiboVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.3.5cpe:2.3:a:xibosignage:xibo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-03  0.48%  0.51%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-05  0.21%  0.48%  +0.27 \n 3  2024-04-29  0.15%  0.21%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-06-06  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/commit/45c6b53c3978639db03b63270a56f4397f49b2c9", "ref_desc": "Various bugfixes (#1777) \u00b7 xibosignage/xibo-cms@45c6b53 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard", "ref_desc": "XIoT Vulnerability Disclosure Dashboard | ClarotyThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jOVzTHM1LBQneZ00Paagv7kQaic.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/commit/1cbba380fa751a00756e70d7b08b5c6646092658", "ref_desc": "Various bugfixes (#1774) \u00b7 xibosignage/xibo-cms@1cbba38 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/security/advisories/GHSA-jj27-x85q-crqv", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution through Zip Slip in Xibo CMS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xibosignage/xibo-cms \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://xibosignage.com/blog/security-advisory-2023-05/", "ref_desc": "Security Advisory - 5 issues affecting the CMSVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ucMEy9Q_B_La8t0JD1PV29_oOuw.html"}]}
