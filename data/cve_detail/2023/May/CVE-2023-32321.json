{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32321", "Description": "CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals. Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ckan which may lead to remote code execution. An arbitrary file write in `resource_create` and `package_update` actions, using the `ResourceUploader` object.  Also reachable via `package_create`, `package_revise`, and `package_patch` via calls to `package_update`. Remote code execution via unsafe pickle loading, via Beaker's session store when configured to use the file session store backend. Potential DOS due to lack of a length check on the resource id. Information disclosure: A user with permission to create a resource can access any other resource on the system if they know the id, even if they don't have access to it. Resource overwrite: A user with permission to create a resource can overwrite any resource if they know the id, even if they don't have access to it. A user with permissions to create or edit a dataset can upload a resource with a specially crafted id to write the uploaded file in an arbitrary location. This can be leveraged to Remote Code Execution via Beaker's insecure pickle loading. All the above listed vulnerabilities have been fixed in CKAN 2.9.9 and CKAN 2.10.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32321", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code;Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nOkfn\u00bbCkanVersions  from including (>=) 2.9.0andbefore (<) 2.9.9cpe:2.3:a:okfn:ckan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOkfn\u00bbCkan\u00bbVersion:2.10.0cpe:2.3:a:okfn:ckan:2.10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.51%  0.57%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-06-27  0.43%  0.51%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-06-01  0.22%  0.43%  +0.21 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.15%  0.22%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-07-05  0.18%  0.15%  -0.02 \n 6  2023-06-27  0.22%  0.18%  -0.04 \n 7  2023-06-03  0.05%  0.22%  +0.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/blob/2a6080e61d5601fa0e2a0317afd6a8e9b7abf6dd/CHANGELOG.rst", "ref_desc": "ckan/CHANGELOG.rst at 2a6080e61d5601fa0e2a0317afd6a8e9b7abf6dd \u00b7 ckan/ckan \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-446m-hmmm-hm8m", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution and private information access via crafted resource ids \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ckan/ckan \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
