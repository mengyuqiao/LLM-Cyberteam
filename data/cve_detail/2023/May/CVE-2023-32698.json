{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32698", "Description": "nFPM is an alternative to fpm. The file permissions on the checked-in files were not maintained. Hence, when nfpm packaged \nthe files (without extra config for enforcing it\u2019s own permissions) files could go out with bad permissions (chmod 666 or 777). Anyone using nfpm for creating packages without checking/setting file permissions before packaging could result in bad permissions for files/folders.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32698", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoreleaser\u00bbNfpmVersions  from including (>=) 0.1.0andbefore (<) 2.29.0cpe:2.3:a:goreleaser:nfpm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/commit/ed9abdf63d5012cc884f2a83b4ab2b42b3680d30", "ref_desc": "sec: fix for CVE-2023-32698 \u00b7 goreleaser/nfpm@ed9abdf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/releases/tag/v2.29.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.29.0 \u00b7 goreleaser/nfpm \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/security/advisories/GHSA-w7jw-q4fg-qc4c", "ref_desc": "Depending on usage of nfpm could produce CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 goreleaser/nfpm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
