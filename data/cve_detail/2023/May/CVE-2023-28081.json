{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28081", "Description": "A bytecode optimization bug in Hermes prior to commit e6ed9c1a4b02dc219de1648f44cd808a56171b81 could be used to cause an use-after-free and obtain arbitrary code execution via a carefully crafted payload. Note that this is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28081", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nFacebook\u00bbHermes\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:facebook:hermes:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.42%  0.47%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-06-19  0.36%  0.42%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-05-24  0.19%  0.36%  +0.17 \n 4  2024-04-17  0.13%  0.19%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-05-27  0.05%  0.13%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/e6ed9c1a4b02dc219de1648f44cd808a56171b81", "ref_desc": "Re-sync with internal repository (#960) \u00b7 facebook/hermes@e6ed9c1 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6ghbt5aKEXDcRYpOgdw-Sovt3yk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2023-28081", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-28081Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
