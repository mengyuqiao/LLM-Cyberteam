{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-30571", "Description": "Libarchive through 3.6.2 can cause directories to have world-writable permissions. The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race condition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions 0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local user can delete and rename files inside those directories.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30571", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLibarchive\u00bbLibarchiveVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.6.2cpe:2.3:a:libarchive:libarchive:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/libarchive-announce", "ref_desc": "libarchive-announce - Google GroupsRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/1876", "ref_desc": "Race condition in multi-threaded use of archive_write_disk_header() on posix based systems \u00b7 Issue #1876 \u00b7 libarchive/libarchive \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
