{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28433", "Description": "Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. All users on Windows prior to version RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z are impacted. MinIO fails to filter the `\\` character, which allows for arbitrary object placement across buckets. As a result, a user with low privileges, such as an access key, service account, or STS credential, which only has permission to `PutObject` in a specific bucket, can create an admin user. This issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28433", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinioVersions  before (<) 2023-03-20t20-16-18zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-27  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-12  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-28  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 5  2024-02-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-w23q-4hw3-2pp6", "ref_desc": "Privilege Escalation on Windows via Path separator manipulation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/8d6558b23649f613414c8527b58973fbdfa4d1b8", "ref_desc": "fix: convert '\\' to '/' on windows (#16852) \u00b7 minio/minio@8d6558b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/b3c54ec81e0a06392abfb3a1ffcdc80c6fbf6ebc", "ref_desc": "reject object names with '\\' on windows (#16856) \u00b7 minio/minio@b3c54ec \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z", "ref_desc": "Release Security and Bug Fixes Release \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uaBGuAj8SDXjYsbSHl6VR2kbzQ0.html"}]}
