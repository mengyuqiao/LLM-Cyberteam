{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25170", "Description": "PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application that, prior to version 8.0.1, is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). When authenticating users, PrestaShop preserves session attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might enable same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by performing an attack similar to a session-fixation. The problem is fixed in version 8.0.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25170", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nPrestashop\u00bbPrestashopVersions  before (<) 8.0.1cpe:2.3:a:prestashop:prestashop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-03  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-19  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-11  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-24  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-3g43-x7qr-96ph", "ref_desc": "Possible CSRF token fixation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PrestaShop/PrestaShop \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
