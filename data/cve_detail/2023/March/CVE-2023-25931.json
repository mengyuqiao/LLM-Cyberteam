{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25931", "Description": "Medtronic identified that the Pelvic Health clinician apps, which are installed on the Smart Programmer mobile device, have a password vulnerability that requires a security update to fix. Not updating could potentially result in unauthorized control of the clinician therapy application, which has greater control over therapy parameters than the patient app. Changes still cannot be made outside of the established therapy parameters of the programmer. For unauthorized access to occur, an individual would need physical access to the Smart Programmer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25931", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMedtronic\u00bbMicro Clinician\u00bbVersion:A51200cpe:2.3:a:medtronic:micro_clinician:a51200:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMedtronic\u00bbInterstim X Clinician\u00bbVersion:A51300cpe:2.3:a:medtronic:interstim_x_clinician:a51300:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-02  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-620 Unverified Password Change", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/620/Unverified-Password-Change.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://global.medtronic.com/xg-en/product-security/security-bulletins/pelvic-health-interstim-micro.html", "ref_desc": "Error \u2013 Page Not Found | MedtronicVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
