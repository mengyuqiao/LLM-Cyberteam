{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28444", "Description": "angular-server-side-configuration helps configure an angular application at runtime on the server or in a docker container via environment variables. angular-server-side-configuration detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json file in the output directory. During deployment of an Angular based app, the environment variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined index file). With version 15.0.0 the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json, which would then be populated and exposed via index.html. This has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular project that has no backend component. This vulnerability has been mitigated in version 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection file range by default. As a workaround, manually edit or create ngssc.json or run script after ngssc.json generation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28444", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nAngular-server-side-configuration Project\u00bbAngular-server-side-configurationVersions  from including (>=) 15.0.0andbefore (<) 15.1.0cpe:2.3:a:angular-server-side-configuration_project:angular-server-side-configuration:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-14  0.15%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-03  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-30  0.06%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-04-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-538 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/538/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Externally-Accessibl.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/releases/tag/v15.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release v15.1.0 \u00b7 kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/commit/d701f51260637a84ede278e248934e0437a7ff86", "ref_desc": "feat: add searchPattern as an option and restrict default search patt\u2026 \u00b7 kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration@d701f51 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/security/advisories/GHSA-gwvm-vrp4-4pp5", "ref_desc": "angular-server-side-configuration information disclosure vulnerability in monorepo with node.js backend \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
