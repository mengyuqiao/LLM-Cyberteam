{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28099", "Description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, if `ds_is_in_list()` is used with an invalid IP address string (`NULL` is illegal input), OpenSIPS will attempt to print a string from a random address (stack garbage), which could lead to a crash. All users of `ds_is_in_list()` without the `$si` variable as 1st parameter could be affected by this vulnerability to a larger, lesser or no extent at all, depending if the data passed to the function is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address string or not. Fixes will are available starting with the 3.1.9 and 3.2.6 minor releases. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28099", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.6cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  before (<) 3.1.9cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-10-05  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-08-25  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-06-19  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 6  2024-04-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-03-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-02-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-pfm5-6vhv-3ff3", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in the ds_is_in_list() function \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/issues/2780", "ref_desc": "[Vuln] Potential arbitrary-memory-log in ds_is_in_list due to uninit varaible on stack \u00b7 Issue #2780 \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/e2f13d374", "ref_desc": "dispatcher: Fix IP printing on error case \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips@e2f13d3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
