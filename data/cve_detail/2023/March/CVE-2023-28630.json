{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28630", "Description": "GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. In GoCD versions from 20.5.0 and below 23.1.0, if the server environment is not correctly configured by administrators to provide access to the relevant PostgreSQL or MySQL backup tools, the credentials for database access may be unintentionally leaked to admin alerts on the GoCD user interface. The vulnerability is triggered only if the GoCD server host is misconfigured to have backups enabled, but does not have access to the `pg_dump` or `mysqldump` utility tools to backup the configured database type (PostgreSQL or MySQL respectively). In such cases, failure to launch the expected backup utility reports the shell environment used to attempt to launch in the server admin alert, which includes the plaintext database password supplied to the configured tool. This vulnerability does not affect backups of the default on-disk H2 database that GoCD is configured to use. This issue has been addressed and fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable backups, or administrators should ensure that the required `pg_dump` (PostgreSQL) or `mysqldump` (MySQL) binaries are available on the GoCD server when backups are triggered.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28630", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  from including (>=) 20.5.0andbefore (<) 23.1.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/23.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release GoCD 23.1.0 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DJAMkTqpL7PtF3ntHBZ8Qwf2qSk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#23-1-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gsP2Xx5gans6NnduW-5aGfD-vG4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-p95w-gh78-qjmv", "ref_desc": "Sensitive information disclosure possible on misconfigured failed backups of non-H2 databases \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/6545481e7b36817dd6033bf614585a8db242070d", "ref_desc": "Improve error messages on failure to launch backup process \u00b7 gocd/gocd@6545481 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
