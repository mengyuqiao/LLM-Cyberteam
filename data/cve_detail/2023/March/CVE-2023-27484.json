{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27484", "Description": "crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes controllers in Crossplane and its related stacks. In affected versions an already highly privileged user able to create or update Compositions can specify an arbitrarily high index in a patch's `ToFieldPath`, which could lead to excessive memory usage once such Composition is selected for a Composite resource. Compositions allow users to specify patches inserting elements into arrays at an arbitrary index. When a Composition is selected for a Composite Resource, patches are evaluated and if a specified index is greater than the current size of the target slice, Crossplane will grow that slice up to the specified index, which could lead to an excessive amount of memory usage and therefore the Pod being OOM-Killed. The index is already capped to the maximum value for a uint32 (4294967295) when parsed, but that is still an unnecessarily large value. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.11.2, 1.10.3, and 1.9.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can restrict write privileges on Compositions to only admin users as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27484", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCrossplane\u00bbCrossplaneVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.10.3cpe:2.3:a:crossplane:crossplane:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCrossplane\u00bbCrossplaneVersions  from including (>=) 1.11.0andbefore (<) 1.11.2cpe:2.3:a:crossplane:crossplane:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCrossplane\u00bbCrossplaneVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.0andbefore (<) 1.9.2cpe:2.3:a:crossplane:crossplane:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-29  0.07%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-03-15  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-18  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/security/advisories/GHSA-v829-x6hh-cqfq", "ref_desc": "Unchecked fieldpath index in Composition's patches can lead to arbitrary memory allocation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 crossplane/crossplane \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
