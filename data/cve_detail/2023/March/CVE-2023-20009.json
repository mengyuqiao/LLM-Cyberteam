{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20009", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Web UI and administrative CLI of the Cisco Secure Email Gateway (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager (SMA) could allow an authenticated remote attacker and or authenticated local attacker to escalate their privilege level and gain root access. The attacker has to have a valid user credential with at least a [[privilege of operator - validate actual name]].\r\n\r The vulnerability is due to the processing of a specially crafted SNMP configuration file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and uploading a specially crafted SNMP configuration file that when uploaded could allow for the execution of commands as root. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain root access on the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20009", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security ApplianceVersions  from including (>=) 14.3.0andbefore (<) 14.3.0-032cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security ApplianceVersions  from including (>=) 13.0.0andbefore (<) 13.0.5-007cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security ApplianceVersions  from including (>=) 14.0.0andbefore (<) 14.2.1-020cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security ApplianceVersions  before (<) 12.5.3-041cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security ApplianceVersions  from including (>=) 13.5.0andbefore (<) 13.5.4-038cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Email And Web ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 13.8.0andbefore (<) 13.8.1-108cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_email_and_web_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Email And Web ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 14.3.0andbefore (<) 14.3.0-120cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_email_and_web_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Email And Web ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 14.0.0andbefore (<) 14.2.0-224cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_email_and_web_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSecure Email And Web ManagerVersions  before (<) 12.8.1-021cpe:2.3:a:cisco:secure_email_and_web_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-23  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-08  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-02-23  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-01-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-01-06  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.05%  -1.11 \n 8  2023-03-02  2.72%  1.16%  -1.57 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-sma-privesc-9DVkFpJ8", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/69JUC0PmiOdBL6tUAu_uBHFfZsw.html"}]}
