{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28424", "Description": "Soko if the code that powers packages.gentoo.org. Prior to version 1.0.2, the two package search handlers, `Search` and `SearchFeed`, implemented in `pkg/app/handler/packages/search.go`, are affected by a SQL injection via the `q` parameter. As a result, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on `https://packages.gentoo.org/`. It was also demonstrated that primitive was enough to gain code execution in the context of the PostgreSQL container. The issue was addressed in commit `4fa6e4b619c0362728955b6ec56eab0e0cbf1e23y` of version 1.0.2 using prepared statements to interpolate user-controlled data in SQL queries.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28424", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nGentoo\u00bbSokoVersions  before (<) 1.0.2cpe:2.3:a:gentoo:soko:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 69 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-10  0.30%  0.28%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-08-30  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-04-21  0.23%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-03-26  0.14%  0.23%  +0.09 \n 5  2024-02-18  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-05-22  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-25  0.04%  0.10%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gitweb.gentoo.org/sites/soko.git/commit/?id=4fa6e4b619c0362728955b6ec56eab0e0cbf1e23", "ref_desc": "sites/soko.git - packages.gentoo.org (PROD)Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gentoo/soko/security/advisories/GHSA-gc2x-86p3-mxg2", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection(s) in pkg/app/handler/packages/search.go \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gentoo/soko \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
