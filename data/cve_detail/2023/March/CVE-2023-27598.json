{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27598", "Description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, sending a malformed `Via` header to OpenSIPS triggers a segmentation fault when the function `calc_tag_suffix` is called. A specially crafted `Via` header, which is deemed correct by the parser, will pass uninitialized strings to the function `MD5StringArray` which leads to the crash. Abuse of this vulnerability leads to Denial of Service due to a crash. Since the uninitialized string points to memory location `0x0`, no further exploitation appears to be possible. No special network privileges are required to perform this attack, as long as the OpenSIPS configuration makes use of functions such as `sl_send_reply` or `sl_gen_totag` that trigger the vulnerable code. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27598", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.4cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  before (<) 3.1.7cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-05  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-08-25  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-02-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/908/Use-of-Uninitialized-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/ab611f74f69d9c42be5401c40d56ea06a58f5dd7", "ref_desc": "[core] fix parse_via() parsing \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips@ab611f7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-wxfg-3gwh-rhvx", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in the parse_via() function \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/N7I_gvY1V8PDIGhrAtX6_M_mTgE.html"}]}
