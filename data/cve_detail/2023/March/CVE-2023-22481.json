{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22481", "Description": "FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. When using the greader API, the provided password is logged in clear in `users/_/log_api.txt` in the case where the authentication fails. The issues occurs in `authorizationToUser()` in `greader.php`. If there is an issue with the request or the credentials, `unauthorized()` or `badRequest()` is called. Both these functions are printing the return of `debugInfo()` in the logs. `debugInfo()` will return the content of the request. By default, this will be saved in `users/_/log_api.txt` and if the const `COPY_LOG_TO_SYSLOG` is true, in syslogs as well. Exploiting this issue requires having access to logs produced by FreshRSS. Using the information from the logs, a malicious individual could get users' API keys (would be displayed if the users fills in a bad username) or passwords.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22481", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFreshrss\u00bbFreshrssVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.0andbefore (<) 1.21.0cpe:2.3:a:freshrss:freshrss:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/075cf4c800063e3cc65c3d41a9c23222e8ebb554", "ref_desc": "API avoid logging passwords (#5001) \u00b7 FreshRSS/FreshRSS@075cf4c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-8vvv-jxg6-8578", "ref_desc": "Sensitive information exposure in the logs of greader API \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FreshRSS/FreshRSS \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
