{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28833", "Description": "Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions admins of a server were able to upload a logo or a favicon and to provided a file name which was not restricted and could overwrite files in the appdata directory. Administrators may have access to overwrite these files by other means but this method could be exploited by tricking an admin into uploading a maliciously named file. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. Users unable to upgrade should avoid ingesting logo files from untrusted sources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28833", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.0andbefore (<) 25.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.10cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.10cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 23.0.0andbefore (<) 23.0.14cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.0andbefore (<) 25.0.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-09  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-05-01  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-05  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-28  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-04-08  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/36095", "ref_desc": "Limit key names when uploading theme images by PVince81 \u00b7 Pull Request #36095 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-ch7f-px7m-hg25", "ref_desc": "Ability to control the filename when uploading a logo or favicon as admin in the theming settings \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
