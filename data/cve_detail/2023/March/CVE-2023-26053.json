{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26053", "Description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. This is a collision attack on long IDs (64bits) for PGP keys. Users of dependency verification in Gradle are vulnerable if they use long IDs for PGP keys in a `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in their dependency verification metadata file. The fix is to fail dependency verification if anything but a fingerprint is used in a trust element in dependency verification metadata. The problem is fixed in Gradle 8.0 and above. The problem is also patched in Gradle 6.9.4 and 7.6.1. As a workaround, use only full fingerprint IDs for `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in the metadata is a protection against this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26053", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nGradle\u00bbGradleVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.6.1cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGradle\u00bbGradleVersions  from including (>=) 6.2.0andbefore (<) 6.9.4cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.32%  0.37%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-22  0.27%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-08-12  0.24%  0.27%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-04-03  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-03-08  0.10%  0.21%  +0.12 \n 7  2024-01-30  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-04-15  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 9  2023-03-10  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 \n 10  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-829 Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/829/Inclusion-of-Functionality-from-Untrusted-Control-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-c724-3xg7-g3hf", "ref_desc": "Dependency verification: Usage of long IDs for PGP keys is unsafe and is subject to collision attacks \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230413-0002/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-26053 Gradle Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commit/bf3cc0f2b463033037e67aaacda31291643ea1a9", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #23946 Trusted GPG-key should only accept 160-bit \u2026 \u00b7 gradle/gradle@bf3cc0f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
