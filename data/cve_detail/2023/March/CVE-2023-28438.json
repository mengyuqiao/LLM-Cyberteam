{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28438", "Description": "Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. Prior to version 10.5.19, since a user with 'report' permission can already write arbitrary SQL queries and given the fact that this endpoint is using the GET method (no CSRF protection), an attacker can inject an arbitrary query by manipulating a user to click on a link. Users should upgrade to version 10.5.19 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, may apply the patch manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28438", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection;Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nPimcore\u00bbPimcoreVersions  before (<) 10.5.19cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:pimcore:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-27  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-12  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-09-01  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-28  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 6  2024-02-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-vf7q-g2pv-jxvx", "ref_desc": "Improper quoting of filters & path traversal in Custom Reports \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/d1abadb181c88ebaa4bce1916f9077469d4ea2bc.patch", "ref_desc": "Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/14526", "ref_desc": "[Task] Optimized custom reports filter by Corepex \u00b7 Pull Request #14526 \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
