{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27580", "Description": "CodeIgniter Shield provides authentication and authorization for the CodeIgniter 4 PHP framework. An improper implementation was found in the password storage process. All hashed passwords stored in Shield v1.0.0-beta.3 or earlier are easier to crack than expected due to the vulnerability. Therefore, they should be removed as soon as possible. If an attacker gets (1) the user's hashed password by Shield, and (2) the hashed password (SHA-384 hash without salt) from somewhere, the attacker may easily crack the user's password. Upgrade to Shield v1.0.0-beta.4 or later to fix this issue. After upgrading, all users\u2019 hashed passwords should be updated (saved to the database). There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27580", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCodeigniter\u00bbShield\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateBetacpe:2.3:a:codeigniter:shield:1.0.0:beta:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCodeigniter\u00bbShield\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter:shield:1.0.0:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCodeigniter\u00bbShield\u00bbVersion:1.0.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter:shield:1.0.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-03  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-23  0.15%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-17  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-14  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-19  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-02-11  0.07%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-24  0.04%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pre-hashing-passwords", "ref_desc": "Password Storage - OWASP Cheat Sheet SeriesNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2015/03/security-issue-combining-bcrypt-with.html", "ref_desc": "Security Issue: Combining Bcrypt With Other Hash Functions | ircmaxell's BlogThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/blob/develop/UPGRADING.md", "ref_desc": "shield/UPGRADING.md at develop \u00b7 codeigniter4/shield \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.scottbrady91.com/authentication/beware-of-password-shucking", "ref_desc": "Beware of Password ShuckingThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/commit/ea9688dd01d100193d834117dbfc2cfabcf9ea0b", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-c5vj-f36q-p9vg \u00b7 codeigniter4/shield@ea9688d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/security/advisories/GHSA-c5vj-f36q-p9vg", "ref_desc": "Password Shucking Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 codeigniter4/shield \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
