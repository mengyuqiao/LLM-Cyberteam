{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28628", "Description": "lambdaisland/uri is a pure Clojure/ClojureScript URI library. In versions prior to 1.14.120 `authority-regex` allows an attacker to send malicious URLs to be parsed by the `lambdaisland/uri` and return the wrong authority. This issue is similar to but distinct from CVE-2020-8910. The regex in question doesn't handle the backslash (`\\`) character in the username correctly, leading to a wrong output. ex. a payload of `https://example.com\\\\@google.com` would return that the host is `google.com`, but the correct host should be `example.com`. Given that the library returns the wrong authority this may be abused to bypass host restrictions depending on how the library is used in an application. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28628", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nLambdaisland\u00bbURIVersions  before (<) 1.14.120cpe:2.3:a:lambdaisland:uri:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-06  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-28  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-02  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/706/Use-of-Incorrectly-Resolved-Name-or-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/lambdaisland/uri/commit/f46db3e84846f79e14bfee0101d9c7a872321820", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-cp4w-6x4w-v2h5 \u00b7 lambdaisland/uri@f46db3e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lambdaisland/uri/security/advisories/GHSA-cp4w-6x4w-v2h5", "ref_desc": "`authority-regex` returns the wrong authority \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 lambdaisland/uri \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
