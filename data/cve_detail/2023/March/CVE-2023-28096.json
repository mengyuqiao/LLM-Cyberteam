{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28096", "Description": "OpenSIPS, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation, has a memory leak starting in the 2.3 branch and priot to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5. The memory leak was detected in the function `parse_mi_request` while performing coverage-guided fuzzing. This issue can be reproduced by sending multiple requests of the form `{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\"method\": \"log_le`. This malformed message was tested against an instance of OpenSIPS via FIFO transport layer and was found to increase the memory consumption over time. To abuse this memory leak, attackers need to reach the management interface (MI) which typically should only be exposed on trusted interfaces. In cases where the MI is exposed to the internet without authentication, abuse of this issue will lead to memory exhaustion which may affect the underlying system\u2019s availability. No authentication is typically required to reproduce this issue. On the other hand, memory leaks may occur in other areas of OpenSIPS where the cJSON library is used for parsing JSON objects. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28096", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.5cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  before (<) 3.1.8cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-05  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-08-25  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-02-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-2mg2-g46r-j4qr", "ref_desc": "Memory leak in cJSON lib \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/N7I_gvY1V8PDIGhrAtX6_M_mTgE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/417568707520af25ec5c5dd91da18e6db3649dcb", "ref_desc": "cJSON: fix memory leak on object parsing error \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips@4175687 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
