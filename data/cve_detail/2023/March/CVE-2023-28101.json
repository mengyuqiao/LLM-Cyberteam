{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28101", "Description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4, if an attacker publishes a Flatpak app with elevated permissions, they can hide those permissions from users of the `flatpak(1)` command-line interface by setting other permissions to crafted values that contain non-printable control characters such as `ESC`. A fix is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, use a GUI like GNOME Software rather than the command-line interface, or only install apps whose maintainers you trust.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28101", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 1.15.0andbefore (<) 1.15.4cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.8cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.14.4cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  before (<) 1.10.8cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.08%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-20  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-03-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-23  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/409e34187de2b2b2c4ef34c79f417be698830f6c", "ref_desc": "cli-transaction: Escape any special characters in the EOL reason \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@409e341 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-h43h-fwqx-mpp8", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-28101: Metadata with ANSI control codes can cause misleading terminal output \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-12", "ref_desc": "Flatpak: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202312-12) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QhrImzUJpyGPk8qiCq8575VbcGg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/7fe63f2e8f1fd2dafc31d45154cf0b191ebec66c", "ref_desc": "Reject paths given to --filesystem/--persist with special characters \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@7fe63f2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6cac99dafe6003c8a4bd5666341c217876536869", "ref_desc": "Ensure special characters in permissions and metadata are escaped \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@6cac99d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
