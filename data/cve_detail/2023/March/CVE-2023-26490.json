{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26490", "Description": "mailcow is a dockerized email package, with multiple containers linked in one bridged network. The Sync Job feature - which can be made available to standard users by assigning them the necessary permission - suffers from a shell command injection. A malicious user can abuse this vulnerability to obtain shell access to the Docker container running dovecot. The imapsync Perl script implements all the necessary functionality for this feature, including the XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism. This code path creates a shell command to call openssl. However, since different parts of the specified user password are included without any validation, one can simply execute additional shell commands. Notably, the default ACL for a newly-created mailcow account does not include the necessary permission. The Issue has been fixed within the 2023-03 Update (March 3rd 2023). As a temporary workaround the Syncjob ACL can be removed from all mailbox users, preventing from creating or changing existing Syncjobs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26490", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMailcow\u00bbMailcow: DockerizedVersions  before (<) 2023-03cpe:2.3:a:mailcow:mailcow\\:_dockerized:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.20%  0.20%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-08  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-09-23  0.17%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-08-13  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 6  2024-03-09  0.10%  0.17%  +0.07 \n 7  2024-02-01  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-01-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-10  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.06%  0.04%  -2.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-3j2f-wf52-cjg7", "ref_desc": "Shell command injection via xoauth2 authentication in imapsync\u200b \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/releases/tag/2023-03", "ref_desc": "Release \ud83d\udcae\ud83d\udc2e Moorch 2023 Update - \u26a0\ufe0f CVE-2023-26490 \u26a0\ufe0f and some fixes \u00b7 mailcow/mailcow-dockerized \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
