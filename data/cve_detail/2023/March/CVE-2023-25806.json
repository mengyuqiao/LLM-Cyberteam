{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25806", "Description": "OpenSearch Security is a plugin for OpenSearch that offers encryption, authentication and authorization. There is an observable discrepancy in the authentication response time between calls where the user provided exists and calls where it does not. This issue only affects calls using the internal basic identity provider (IdP), and not other externally configured IdPs. Patches were released in versions 1.3.9 and 2.6.0, there are no workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25806", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  before (<) 1.3.9cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch Security\u00bbForOpensearchVersions  before (<) 1.3.9cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch_security:*:*:*:*:*:opensearch:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch Security\u00bbForOpensearchVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.6.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch_security:*:*:*:*:*:opensearch:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-22  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/208/Observable-Timing-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-c6wg-cm5x-rqvj", "ref_desc": "Time discrepancy in authentication responses \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/security \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
