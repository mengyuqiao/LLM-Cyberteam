This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. These actions could include modifying the system configuration and deleting accounts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20113", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSd-wanVersions  before (<) 20.6.5cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan\u00bbVersion:20.9.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbSd-wan\u00bbVersion:20.8.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-13  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2024-09-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-29  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-21  0.07%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-04-04  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vman-csrf-76RDbLEh", "ref_desc": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Cross-Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
