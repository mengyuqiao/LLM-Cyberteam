{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23939", "Description": "Azure/setup-kubectl is a GitHub Action for installing Kubectl. This vulnerability only impacts versions before version 3. An insecure temporary creation of a file allows other actors on the Actions runner to replace the Kubectl binary created by this action because it is world writable. This Kubectl tool installer runs `fs.chmodSync(kubectlPath, 777)` to set permissions on the Kubectl binary, however, this allows any local user to replace the Kubectl binary. This allows privilege escalation to the user that can also run kubectl, most likely root. This attack is only possible if an attacker somehow breached the GitHub actions runner or if a user is utilizing an Action that maliciously executes this attack. This has been fixed and released in all versions `v3` and later. 775 permissions are used instead. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23939", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbAzure Setup KubectlVersions  before (<) 3.0cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:azure_setup_kubectl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 15 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-16  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-07-16  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-07-08  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-04-08  0.07%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-04-07  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 7  2023-03-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Azure/setup-kubectl/security/advisories/GHSA-p756-rfxh-x63h", "ref_desc": "Azure/setup-kubectl: Escalation of privilege vulnerability for v3 and lower \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Azure/setup-kubectl \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Azure/setup-kubectl/commit/d449d75495d2b9d1463555bb00ca3dca77a42ab6", "ref_desc": "lower permissions for chmod (#51) \u00b7 Azure/setup-kubectl@d449d75 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
