{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27578", "Description": "Galaxy is an open-source platform for data analysis. All supported versions of Galaxy are affected prior to 22.01, 22.05, and 23.0 are affected by an insufficient permission check. Unsupported versions are likely affected as far back as the functionality of Visualizations/Pages exists. Due to this issue, an attacker can modify or delete any Galaxy Visualization or Galaxy Page given they know the encoded ID of it. Additionally, they can copy or import any Galaxy Visualization given they know the encoded ID of it. Patches are available for versions 22.01, 22.05, and 23.0. For the changes to take effect, you must restart all Galaxy server processes. There are no supported workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27578", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGalaxyproject\u00bbGalaxyVersions  before (<) 22.01cpe:2.3:a:galaxyproject:galaxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-10  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-08-30  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-26  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://depot.galaxyproject.org/patch/GX-2022-0002/modify_pages_viz-release_22.01.patch", "ref_desc": "403 ForbiddenBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://depot.galaxyproject.org/patch/GX-2022-0002/modify_pages_viz-release_22.05.patch", "ref_desc": "403 ForbiddenBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/security/advisories/GHSA-j8q2-r4g5-f22j", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized modification of pages/visualizations due to insufficient permission check \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 galaxyproject/galaxy \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://depot.galaxyproject.org/patch/GX-2022-0002/modify_pages_viz-release_23.0.patch", "ref_desc": "403 ForbiddenBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
