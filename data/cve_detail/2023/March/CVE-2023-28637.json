{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28637", "Description": "DataEase is an open source data visualization analysis tool. In Dataease users are normally allowed to modify data and the data sources are expected to properly sanitize data. The AWS redshift data source does not provide data sanitization which may lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability has been fixed in v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28637", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDataease\u00bbDataeaseVersions  before (<) 1.18.5cpe:2.3:a:dataease:dataease:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-02  0.21%  0.22%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-03  0.12%  0.19%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-02-26  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-02  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-05  0.05%  0.11%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dataease/dataease/security/advisories/GHSA-8wg2-9gwc-5fx2", "ref_desc": "DataEase AWS redshift data source exists for remote code execution vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dataease/dataease \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
