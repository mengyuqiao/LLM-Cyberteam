{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28439", "Description": "CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor. A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting Iframe Dialog and Media Embed packages. The vulnerability may trigger a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions: using one of the affected packages on a web page with missing proper Content Security Policy configuration; initializing the editor on an element and using an element other than `<textarea>` as a base; and destroying the editor instance. This vulnerability might affect a small percentage of integrators that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism.\n\nA fix is available in CKEditor4 version 4.21.0. In some rare cases, a security fix may be considered a breaking change. Starting from version 4.21.0, the Iframe Dialog plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restricts JavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this behavior, configure the `config.iframe_attributes` option. Also starting from version 4.21.0, the Media Embed plugin regenerates the entire content of the embed widget by default. To change this behavior, configure the `config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option. Those who choose to enable either of the more permissive options or who cannot upgrade to a patched version should properly configure Content Security Policy to avoid any potential security issues that may arise from embedding iframe elements on their web page.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28439", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:39cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:39:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCkeditor\u00bbCkeditorVersions  from including (>=) 4.0andbefore (<) 4.21.0cpe:2.3:a:ckeditor:ckeditor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.36%  0.52%  +0.16 \n 2  2024-10-12  0.40%  0.36%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-09-01  0.34%  0.40%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-06-26  0.32%  0.34%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-23  0.29%  0.32%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-03-28  0.12%  0.29%  +0.17 \n 7  2024-02-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-01-19  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 9  2023-11-05  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-03-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L4ODGOW6PYVOXHQSMWJBOCE6DXWAI33W/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: ckeditor-4.22.1-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-vh5c-xwqv-cv9g", "ref_desc": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) caused by the editor instance destroying process \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ckeditor/ckeditor4 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/iframe", "ref_desc": "IFrame Dialog | CKEditor.comProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VCYKD3JZWWA3ESOZG4PHJJEXT4EYIUIQ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: ckeditor-4.22.1-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GWKG2VCPJNETVCDTXU4X6FQ2PO6XCNGN/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: ckeditor-4.22.1-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embed", "ref_desc": "Media Embed | CKEditor.comProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
