{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27486", "Description": "xCAT is a toolkit for deployment and administration of computer clusters. In versions prior to 2.16.5 if zones are configured as a mechanism to secure clusters in XCAT, it is possible for a local root user from one node to obtain credentials to SSH to any node in any zone, except the management node of the default zone. XCAT zones are not enabled by default. Only users that use the optional zone feature are impacted. All versions of xCAT prior to xCAT 2.16.5 are vulnerable. This problem has been fixed in xCAT 2.16.5. Users making use of zones should upgrade to 2.16.5. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the issue by disabling zones or patching the management node with the fix contained in commit `85149c37f49`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27486", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXcat Project\u00bbXcatVersions  before (<) 2.16.5cpe:2.3:a:xcat_project:xcat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-27  0.17%  0.22%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-28  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-14  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-02-06  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-16  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xcat2/xcat-core/pull/7247", "ref_desc": "Have server enforce SSH zone separation by jjohnson42 \u00b7 Pull Request #7247 \u00b7 xcat2/xcat-core \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xcat2/xcat-core/security/advisories/GHSA-hpxg-7428-6jvv", "ref_desc": "Insufficient authorization validation between zones when xCAT zones are enabled \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xcat2/xcat-core \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xcat2/xcat-core/issues/7246", "ref_desc": "Unsufficient check in credentials.pm \u00b7 Issue #7246 \u00b7 xcat2/xcat-core \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xcat2/xcat-core/pull/7247/commits/85149c37f49dbca7bd85f1f586960315604fc024", "ref_desc": "Have server enforce SSH zone separation by jjohnson42 \u00b7 Pull Request #7247 \u00b7 xcat2/xcat-core \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
