{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28100", "Description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. Versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4 contain a vulnerability similar to CVE-2017-5226, but using the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl command instead of `TIOCSTI`. If a Flatpak app is run on a Linux virtual console such as `/dev/tty1`, it can copy text from the virtual console and paste it into the command buffer, from which the command might be run after the Flatpak app has exited. Ordinary graphical terminal emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal and Konsole are unaffected. This vulnerability is specific to the Linux virtual consoles `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/tty2` and so on. A patch is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, don't run Flatpak on a Linux virtual console. Flatpak is primarily designed to be used in a Wayland or X11 graphical environment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28100", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 1.15.0andbefore (<) 1.15.4cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.8cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.14.4cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  before (<) 1.10.8cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-04-19  0.09%  0.04%  -0.05 \n 2  2023-04-17  0.13%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-23  0.05%  0.13%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=167879021709955&w=2", "ref_desc": "'Re: [oss-security] TTY pushback vulnerabilities / TIOCSTI' - MARCMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/12itfqyvpLvbk1XMw9FYMURLjZ4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-7qpw-3vjv-xrqp", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-28100: TIOCLINUX can send commands outside sandbox if running on a virtual console \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-12", "ref_desc": "Flatpak: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202312-12) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QhrImzUJpyGPk8qiCq8575VbcGg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/8e63de9a7d3124f91140fc74f8ca9ed73ed53be9", "ref_desc": "run: Prevent TIOCLINUX ioctl, the same as TIOCSTI \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak@8e63de9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
