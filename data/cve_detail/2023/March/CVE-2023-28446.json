{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28446", "Description": "Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. Arbitrary program names without any ANSI filtering allows any malicious program to clear the first 2 lines of a `op_spawn_child` or `op_kill` prompt and replace it with any desired text. This works with any command on the respective platform, giving the program the full ability to choose what program they wanted to run. This problem can not be exploited on systems that do not attach an interactive prompt (for example headless servers). This issue has been patched in version 1.31.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28446", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDeno\u00bbDenoVersions  before (<) 1.31.2cpe:2.3:a:deno:deno:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.21%  0.26%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-10-29  0.17%  0.21%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-10-14  0.17%  0.17%  -0.01 \n 4  2024-09-03  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-25  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-03-30  0.08%  0.14%  +0.07 \n 7  2024-02-22  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-04-01  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-150 Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/150/Improper-Neutralization-of-Escape-Meta-or-Control-Sequence.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-vq67-rp93-65qf", "ref_desc": "Interactive `run` permission prompt spoofing via improper ANSI neutralization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.31.2", "ref_desc": "Release v1.31.2 \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/7d13d65468c37022f003bb680dfbddd07ea72173/runtime/js/40_process.js#L175", "ref_desc": "deno/40_process.js at 7d13d65468c37022f003bb680dfbddd07ea72173 \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
