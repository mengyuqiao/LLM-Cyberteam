{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28640", "Description": "Apiman is a flexible and open source API Management platform. Due to a missing permissions check, an attacker with an authenticated Apiman Manager account may be able to gain access to API keys they do not have permission for if they correctly guess the URL, which includes Organisation ID, Client ID, and Client Version of the targeted non-permitted resource. While not trivial to exploit, it could be achieved by brute-forcing or guessing common names. Access to the non-permitted API Keys could allow use of other users' resources without their permission (depending on the specifics of configuration, such as whether an API key is the only form of security). Apiman 3.1.0.Final resolved this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround is to restrict account access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28640", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApiman\u00bbApiman\u00bbVersion:3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:apiman:apiman:3.0.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-02  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/apiman/apiman/security/advisories/GHSA-m6f8-hjrv-mw5f", "ref_desc": "Permissions bypass in Apiman 3.0.0.Final could enable authenticated attacker to unpermitted API Key \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 apiman/apiman \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.apiman.io/blog/potential-permissions-bypass-disclosure/", "ref_desc": "Apiman - Potential permissions bypass in Apiman 3.0.0.Final (CVE-2023-28640)Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
