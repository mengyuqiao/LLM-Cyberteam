{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28095", "Description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Versions prior to 3.1.7 and 3.2.4 have a potential issue in `msg_translator.c:2628` which might lead to a server crash. This issue was found while fuzzing the function `build_res_buf_from_sip_req` but could not be reproduced against a running instance of OpenSIPS. This issue could not be exploited against a running instance of OpenSIPS since no public function was found to make use of this vulnerable code. Even in the case of exploitation through unknown vectors, it is highly unlikely that this issue would lead to anything other than Denial of Service. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28095", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.4cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  before (<) 3.1.7cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-10-05  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-08-25  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-02-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-7pf3-24qg-8v9h", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in the building the local negative replies \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/N7I_gvY1V8PDIGhrAtX6_M_mTgE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/9cf3dd3398719dd91207495f76d7726701c5145c", "ref_desc": "[core] build_res_buf_from_sip_req(): fix hdr correlation \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips@9cf3dd3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
