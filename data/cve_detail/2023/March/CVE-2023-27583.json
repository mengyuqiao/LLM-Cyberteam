{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27583", "Description": "PanIndex is a network disk directory index. In Panindex prior to version 3.1.3, a hard-coded JWT key `PanIndex` is used. An attacker can use the hard-coded JWT key to sign JWT token and perform any actions as a user with admin privileges. Version 3.1.3 has a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may change the JWT key in the source code before compiling the project.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27583", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPanindex Project\u00bbPanindexVersions  before (<) 3.1.3cpe:2.3:a:panindex_project:panindex:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.19%  0.19%  0.00 \n 2  2024-11-01  0.19%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-10-18  0.16%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-10-03  0.16%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-08-23  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-04-14  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-03-19  0.08%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 8  2024-02-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-18  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/commit/f7ec0c5739af055ad3a825a20294a5c01ada3302", "ref_desc": ":bug:Fix login security issues \u00b7 px-org/PanIndex@f7ec0c5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/security/advisories/GHSA-82wq-gmw8-g87v", "ref_desc": "Panindex vulnerable to hard coded cyptographic key \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 px-org/PanIndex \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/releases/tag/v3.1.3", "ref_desc": "Release v3.1.3 \u00b7 px-org/PanIndex \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
