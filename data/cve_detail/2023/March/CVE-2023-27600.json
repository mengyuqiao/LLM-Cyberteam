{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27600", "Description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line` function in the sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling the function with an SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\\n`). The vulnerability was found while performing black-box fuzzing against an OpenSIPS server running a configuration that made use of the functions `codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue was also discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function `codec_delete_except_re`. The crash happens because the function `delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated by a line feed (`\\n`). By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the sanity check that is performed in the `del_lump` function, exploitation of this issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function, resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue is patched in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27600", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.4cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  before (<) 3.1.7cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-25  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-06-19  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 5  2024-04-16  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-03-21  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-02-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://opensips.org/docs/modules/3.3.x/sipmsgops.html", "ref_desc": "sipmsgops ModuleVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hBqKPA9rfkpvWahN93v2rHA_M6Q.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/N7I_gvY1V8PDIGhrAtX6_M_mTgE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-67w7-g4j8-3wcx", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability 2 in the codec_delete_XX() functions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/c6ab3bb406c447e30c7d33a1a8970048b4612100", "ref_desc": "[sipmsgops] fix codec_delete_XX() parsing (2) \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips@c6ab3bb \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
