{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27596", "Description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is sent multiple times to an OpenSIPS configuration that makes use of the `stream_process` function. This issue was discovered during coverage guided fuzzing of the function `codec_delete_except_re`. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. This issue has been fixed in version 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27596", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.5cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  before (<) 3.1.8cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-3ghx-j39m-cw4f", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability 3 in the codec_delete_XX() functions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/dd051f8ed5ae3347fb1d556ced3c97822c9d8450", "ref_desc": "[sipmsgops] fix codec_delete_XX() parsing \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips@dd051f8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
