{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27474", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Instances relying on an allow-listed reset URL are vulnerable to an HTML injection attack through the use of query parameters in the reset URL. An attacker could exploit this to email users urls to the servers domain but which may contain malicious code. The problem has been resolved and released under version 9.23.0. People relying on a custom password reset URL should upgrade to 9.23.0 or later, or remove the custom reset url from the configured allow list. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the custom reset URL allow list as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27474", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nRangerstudio\u00bbDirectusVersions  before (<) 9.23.0cpe:2.3:a:rangerstudio:directus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-12  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-4hmq-ggrm-qfc6", "ref_desc": "HTML Injection in Password Reset email to custom Reset URL \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/17120", "ref_desc": "Fix url encoding query parameters and added tests by tofran \u00b7 Pull Request #17120 \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/17119", "ref_desc": "Password reset improperlly handles url-encoded query parameters in reset_url \u00b7 Issue #17119 \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
