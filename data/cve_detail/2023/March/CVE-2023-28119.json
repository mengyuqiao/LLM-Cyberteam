{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28119", "Description": "The crewjam/saml go library contains a partial implementation of the SAML standard in golang. Prior to version 0.4.13, the package's use of `flate.NewReader` does not limit the size of the input. The user can pass more than 1 MB of data in the HTTP request to the processing functions, which will be decompressed server-side using the Deflate algorithm. Therefore, after repeating the same request multiple times, it is possible to achieve a reliable crash since the operating system kills the process. This issue is patched in version 0.4.13.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28119", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSaml Project\u00bbSaml\u00bbVersion:0.4.12ForGOcpe:2.3:a:saml_project:saml:0.4.12:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-12  0.14%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-01  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-23  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-28  0.07%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-02-20  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-06-29  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 8  2023-03-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/crewjam/saml/security/advisories/GHSA-5mqj-xc49-246p", "ref_desc": "Denial Of Service Via Deflate Decompression Bomb \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 crewjam/saml \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crewjam/saml/commit/8e9236867d176ad6338c870a84e2039aef8a5021", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5mqj-xc49-246p \u00b7 crewjam/saml@8e92368 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
