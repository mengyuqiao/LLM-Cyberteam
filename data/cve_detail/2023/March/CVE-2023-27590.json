{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27590", "Description": "Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. In version 0.5.1 and prior, converting a GDB registers profile file into a Rizin register profile can result in a stack-based buffer overflow when the `name`, `type`, or `groups` fields have longer values than expected. Users opening untrusted GDB registers files (e.g. with the `drpg` or `arpg` commands) are affected by this flaw. Commit d6196703d89c84467b600ba2692534579dc25ed4 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, review the GDB register profiles before loading them with `drpg`/`arpg` commands.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27590", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nRizin\u00bbRizinVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.5.1cpe:2.3:a:rizin:rizin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-19  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-06-18  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-07-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 7  2023-05-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 8  2023-03-22  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/security/advisories/GHSA-rqcp-m8m2-jcqf", "ref_desc": "Stack-based buffer overflow when parsing GDB registers profile files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rizinorg/rizin \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/3422", "ref_desc": "Fix conversion from GDB register profile to rizin profile by ret2libc \u00b7 Pull Request #3422 \u00b7 rizinorg/rizin \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/d6196703d89c84467b600ba2692534579dc25ed4", "ref_desc": "Fix conversion from GDB register profile to rizin profile \u00b7 rizinorg/rizin@d619670 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/3a7d5116244beb678ad9950bb9dd27d28ed2691f/librz/reg/profile.c#L545", "ref_desc": "rizin/profile.c at 3a7d5116244beb678ad9950bb9dd27d28ed2691f \u00b7 rizinorg/rizin \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WW3JXI4TIJIR7PGFP74SN7GQYHW2F46Y/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: rizin-0.5.2-1.fc38.2 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/3a7d5116244beb678ad9950bb9dd27d28ed2691f/librz/reg/profile.c#L514", "ref_desc": "rizin/profile.c at 3a7d5116244beb678ad9950bb9dd27d28ed2691f \u00b7 rizinorg/rizin \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
