{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28108", "Description": "Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. Prior to version 10.5.19, quoting is not done properly in UUID DAO model. There is the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the DAO class. Users should update to version 10.5.19 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, apply the patch manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28108", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nPimcore\u00bbPimcoreVersions  before (<) 10.5.19cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:pimcore:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-23  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-xc9p-r5qj-8xm9", "ref_desc": "Improper quoting of columns when calling methods \"getByUuid\" & \"exists\" on UUID Model \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/08e7ba56ae983c3c67ec563b6989b16ef8f35275.patch", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/14633", "ref_desc": "[Task] Optimized get by UUID by lukmzig \u00b7 Pull Request #14633 \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
