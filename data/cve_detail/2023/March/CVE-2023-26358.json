{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26358", "Description": "Creative Cloud version 5.9.1 (and earlier) is affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the application uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the application trusts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26358", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nAdobe\u00bbCreative CloudVersions  before (<) 5.10cpe:2.3:a:adobe:creative_cloud:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-01  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.07%  0.06%  0.00 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-04-23  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-03-24  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/creative-cloud/apsb23-21.html", "ref_desc": "Adobe Security BulletinVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
