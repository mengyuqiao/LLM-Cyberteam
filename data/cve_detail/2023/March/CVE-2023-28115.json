{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28115", "Description": "Snappy is a PHP library allowing thumbnail, snapshot or PDF generation from a url or a html page. Prior to version 1.4.2, Snappy is vulnerable to PHAR deserialization due to a lack of checking on the protocol before passing it into the `file_exists()` function. If an attacker can upload files of any type to the server he can pass in the phar:// protocol to unserialize the uploaded file and instantiate arbitrary PHP objects. This can lead to remote code execution especially when snappy is used with frameworks with documented POP chains like Laravel/Symfony vulnerable developer code. If a user can control the output file from the `generateFromHtml()` function, it will invoke deserialization. This vulnerability is capable of remote code execution if Snappy is used with frameworks or developer code with vulnerable POP chains. It has been fixed in version 1.4.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28115", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nKnplabs\u00bbSnappyVersions  before (<) 1.4.2cpe:2.3:a:knplabs:snappy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  2.08%  2.56%  +0.48 \n 2  2024-10-22  1.69%  2.08%  +0.39 \n 3  2024-10-07  1.73%  1.69%  -0.04 \n 4  2024-08-27  2.06%  1.73%  -0.33 \n 5  2024-06-21  1.86%  2.06%  +0.20 \n 6  2024-06-08  2.13%  1.86%  -0.27 \n 7  2024-05-13  1.98%  2.13%  +0.15 \n 8  2024-04-18  1.92%  1.98%  +0.06 \n 9  2024-04-05  1.62%  1.92%  +0.30 \n 10  2024-03-23  0.88%  1.62%  +0.74 \n 11  2024-02-15  0.74%  0.88%  +0.13 \n 12  2023-12-19  0.53%  0.74%  +0.22 \n 13  2023-07-08  0.67%  0.53%  -0.15 \n 14  2023-06-24  0.58%  0.67%  +0.10 \n 15  2023-05-08  0.53%  0.58%  +0.05 \n 16  2023-03-25  0.21%  0.53%  +0.32 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/commit/1ee6360cbdbea5d09705909a150df7963a88efd6", "ref_desc": "fix: security issue GHSA-gq6w-q6wh-jggc \u00b7 KnpLabs/snappy@1ee6360 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/releases/tag/v1.4.2", "ref_desc": "Release v1.4.2 \u00b7 KnpLabs/snappy \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-gq6w-q6wh-jggc", "ref_desc": "PHAR deserialization allowing remote code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 KnpLabs/snappy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IWeawGoGzUPE3eGOuz-N5rDdLv0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/blob/5126fb5b335ec929a226314d40cd8dad497c3d67/src/Knp/Snappy/AbstractGenerator.php#L670", "ref_desc": "snappy/AbstractGenerator.php at 5126fb5b335ec929a226314d40cd8dad497c3d67 \u00b7 KnpLabs/snappy \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/commit/b66f79334421c26d9c244427963fa2d92980b5d3", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #469 from KnpLabs/fix/GHSA-gq6w-q6wh-jggc \u00b7 KnpLabs/snappy@b66f793 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/pull/469", "ref_desc": "fix: security issue GHSA-gq6w-q6wh-jggc by AntoineLelaisant \u00b7 Pull Request #469 \u00b7 KnpLabs/snappy \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
