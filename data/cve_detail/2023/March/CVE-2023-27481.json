{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27481", "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27481", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMonospace\u00bbDirectus\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 9.16.0cpe:2.3:a:monospace:directus:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-13  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/14829", "ref_desc": "Check for allowed filter operators when applying filter by licitdev \u00b7 Pull Request #14829 \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-m5q3-8wgf-x8xf", "ref_desc": "Extract password hashes through export querying \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/15010", "ref_desc": "Only allow null filter operators for fields with \"conceal\" special by licitdev \u00b7 Pull Request #15010 \u00b7 directus/directus \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
