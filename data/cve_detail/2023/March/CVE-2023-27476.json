{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27476", "Description": "OWSLib is a Python package for client programming with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web service interface standards, and their related content models. OWSLib's XML parser (which supports both `lxml` and `xml.etree`) does not disable entity resolution, and could lead to arbitrary file reads from an attacker-controlled XML payload. This affects all XML parsing in the codebase. This issue has been addressed in version 0.28.1. All users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround is to patch the library manually. See `GHSA-8h9c-r582-mggc` for details.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27476", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nOsgeo\u00bbOwslibVersions  before (<) 0.28.1cpe:2.3:a:osgeo:owslib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-27  0.18%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-17  0.15%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-06-11  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-08  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-13  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 6  2024-02-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-06-15  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 8  2023-04-16  0.07%  0.06%  0.00 \n 9  2023-03-16  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib/pull/863/commits/b92687702be9576c0681bb11cad21eb631b9122f", "ref_desc": "use only lxml for XML handling by tomkralidis \u00b7 Pull Request #863 \u00b7 geopython/OWSLib \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5426", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5426-1 owslib", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib/security/advisories/GHSA-8h9c-r582-mggc", "ref_desc": "XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in OWSLib \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 geopython/OWSLib \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00032.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3470-1] owslib security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-131_owslib/", "ref_desc": "GitHub Security Lab | Securing the world\u2019s software, togetherBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
