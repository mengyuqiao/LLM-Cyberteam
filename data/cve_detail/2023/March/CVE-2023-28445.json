{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28445", "Description": "Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. Resizable ArrayBuffers passed to asynchronous functions that are shrunk during the asynchronous operation could result in an out-of-bound read/write. It is unlikely that this has been exploited in the wild, as the only version affected is Deno 1.32.0. Deno Deploy users are not affected. The problem has been resolved by disabling resizable ArrayBuffers temporarily in Deno 1.32.1. Deno 1.32.2 will re-enable resizable ArrayBuffers with a proper fix. As a workaround, run with `--v8-flags=--no-harmony-rab-gsab` to disable resizable ArrayBuffers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28445", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nDeno\u00bbDeno\u00bbVersion:1.32.0cpe:2.3:a:deno:deno:1.32.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDeno\u00bbSerde V8\u00bbVersion:0.87.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:deno:serde_v8:0.87.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nDeno\u00bbDeno Runtime\u00bbVersion:0.102.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:deno:deno_runtime:0.102.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-28  0.16%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-10-13  0.16%  0.16%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-09-02  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-24  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-03-29  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-02-21  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-04-01  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-c25x-cm9x-qqgx", "ref_desc": "Improper handling of resizable ArrayBuffer in async built-in functions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/18395", "ref_desc": "fix: disable resizable ArrayBuffer and growable SharedArrayBuffer by bartlomieju \u00b7 Pull Request #18395 \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.32.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.32.1 \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
