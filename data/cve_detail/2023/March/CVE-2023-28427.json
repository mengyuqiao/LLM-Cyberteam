{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28427", "Description": "matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. In versions prior to 24.0.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This vulnerability is distinct from GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32 which covers a similar issue. The issue has been patched in matrix-js-sdk 24.0.0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28427", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbJavascript Sdk\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 24.0.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:javascript_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.64% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.55%  0.64%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-11-02  0.48%  0.55%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-10-18  0.45%  0.48%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-09-07  0.38%  0.45%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-07-02  0.32%  0.38%  +0.06 \n 6  2024-04-29  0.27%  0.32%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-04-03  0.15%  0.27%  +0.11 \n 8  2024-02-26  0.11%  0.15%  +0.04 \n 9  2023-07-08  0.11%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 10  2023-07-05  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 11  2023-04-25  0.05%  0.11%  +0.05 \n 12  2023-04-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 13  2023-04-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://matrix.org/blog/2023/03/28/security-releases-matrix-js-sdk-24-0-0-and-matrix-react-sdk-3-69-0", "ref_desc": "Security releases: matrix-js-sdk 24.0.0 and matrix-react-sdk 3.69.0 | Matrix.orgVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bxJ0ATsNcJxiVrAl3dJlroXHxFI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5392", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5392-1 thunderbird", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00027.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3400-1] thunderbird security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-36", "ref_desc": "Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202305-36) \u2014 Gentoo security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-mwq8-fjpf-c2gr", "ref_desc": "Prototype pollution in matrix-js-sdk (part 2) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
