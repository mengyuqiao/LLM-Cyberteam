{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28109", "Description": "Play With Docker is a browser-based Docker playground. Versions 0.0.2 and prior are vulnerable to domain hijacking. Because CORS configuration was not correct, an attacker could use `play-with-docker.com` as an example and set the origin header in an http request as `evil-play-with-docker.com`. The domain would echo in response header, which successfully bypassed the CORS policy and retrieved basic user information. This issue has been fixed in commit ed82247c9ab7990ad76ec2bf1498c2b2830b6f1a. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28109", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPlay-with-docker\u00bbPlay With Docker\u00bbVersion:0.0.1ForGOcpe:2.3:a:play-with-docker:play_with_docker:0.0.1:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions\nPlay-with-docker\u00bbPlay With Docker\u00bbVersion:0.0.2ForGOcpe:2.3:a:play-with-docker:play_with_docker:0.0.2:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-26  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-17  0.13%  0.19%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-03-22  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-02-14  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-24  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker/commit/ed82247c9ab7990ad76ec2bf1498c2b2830b6f1a", "ref_desc": "fix CORS origins to avoid domain hijacking \u00b7 play-with-docker/play-with-docker@ed82247 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker/security/advisories/GHSA-vq59-5x26-h639", "ref_desc": "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key play-with-docker \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 play-with-docker/play-with-docker \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
