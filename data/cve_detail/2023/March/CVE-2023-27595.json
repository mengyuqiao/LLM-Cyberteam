{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27595", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. In version 1.13.0, when Cilium is started, there is a short period when Cilium eBPF programs are not attached to the host. During this period, the host does not implement any of Cilium's featureset. This can cause disruption to newly established connections during this period due to the lack of Load Balancing, or can cause Network Policy bypass due to the lack of Network Policy enforcement during the window. This vulnerability impacts any Cilium-managed endpoints on the node (such as Kubernetes Pods), as well as the host network namespace (including Host Firewall). This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium 1.13.1 or later. Cilium releases 1.12.x, 1.11.x, and earlier are not affected. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27595", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCilium\u00bbVersion:1.13.0cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:1.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 60 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-10-07  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-08-27  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-18  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-03-23  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-02-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.13.1", "ref_desc": "Release 1.13.1 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jjPxFdYqipnigeFIt6tfrinAcRc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/24336", "ref_desc": "bpf,init.sh: make netdev bpf filter cleanup less eager by ti-mo \u00b7 Pull Request #24336 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-r5x6-w42p-jhpp", "ref_desc": "Cilium eBPF filters may be temporarily removed during agent restart \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
