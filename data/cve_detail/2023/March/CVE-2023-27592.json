{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27592", "Description": "Miniflux is a feed reader. Since v2.0.25, Miniflux will automatically proxy images served over HTTP to prevent mixed content errors. When an outbound request made by the Go HTTP client fails, the `html.ServerError` is returned unescaped without the expected Content Security Policy header added to valid responses. By creating an RSS feed item with the inline description containing an `<img>` tag with a `srcset` attribute pointing to an invalid URL like `http:a<script>alert(1)</script>`, we can coerce the proxy handler into an error condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped and in full. This results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux instance as soon as the user is convinced (e.g. by a message in the alt text) to open the broken image. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim Miniflux user when they open a broken image in a crafted RSS feed. This can be used to perform actions on the Miniflux instance as that user and gain administrative access to the Miniflux instance if it is reachable and the victim is an administrator. A patch is available in version 2.0.43. As a workaround sisable image proxy; default value is `http-only`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27592", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMiniflux Project\u00bbMiniflux\u00bbForGOVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.25andbefore (<) 2.0.43cpe:2.3:a:miniflux_project:miniflux:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.11%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-06-21  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-23  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-15  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-25  0.04%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/miniflux/v2/releases/tag/2.0.43", "ref_desc": "Release Miniflux 2.0.43 \u00b7 miniflux/v2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DhQhiPEexME7xztCOmQiDa6CZcU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miniflux/v2/blob/b2fd84e0d376a3af6329b9bb2e772ce38a25c31c/ui/proxy.go#L76", "ref_desc": "v2/proxy.go at b2fd84e0d376a3af6329b9bb2e772ce38a25c31c \u00b7 miniflux/v2 \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miniflux/v2/blob/b2fd84e0d376a3af6329b9bb2e772ce38a25c31c/ui/proxy.go#L90", "ref_desc": "v2/proxy.go at b2fd84e0d376a3af6329b9bb2e772ce38a25c31c \u00b7 miniflux/v2 \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://miniflux.app/docs/configuration.html#proxy-images", "ref_desc": "Configuration ParametersProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miniflux/v2/pull/1746", "ref_desc": "Avoid XSS when opening a broken image due to unescaped ServerError in proxy handler by fguillot \u00b7 Pull Request #1746 \u00b7 miniflux/v2 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miniflux/v2/releases/tag/2.0.25", "ref_desc": "Release Miniflux 2.0.25 \u00b7 miniflux/v2 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/miniflux/v2/security/advisories/GHSA-mqqg-xjhj-wfgw", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS in Miniflux when opening a broken image due to unescaped ServerError in proxy handler \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 miniflux/v2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
