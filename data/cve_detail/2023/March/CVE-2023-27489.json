{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27489", "Description": "Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and automated testing. Kiwi TCMS accepts SVG files uploaded by users which could potentially contain JavaScript code. If SVG images are viewed directly, i.e. not rendered in an HTML page, this JavaScript code could execute. This vulnerability has been fixed by configuring Kiwi TCMS to serve with the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header which blocks inline JavaScript in all modern browsers. This configuration change is provided in version 12.1 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set their Content-Security-Policy HTTP header manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27489", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nKiwitcms\u00bbKiwi TcmsVersions  before (<) 12.1cpe:2.3:a:kiwitcms:kiwi_tcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-19  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-04-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-04-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-2wcr-87wf-cf9j", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS via SVG file upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/6617cee0fb70cc394b7be6bbc86ef84e6e9de077", "ref_desc": "Define Content-Security-Policy header to block inline JavaScript \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi@6617cee \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
