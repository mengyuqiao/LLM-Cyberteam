{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20088", "Description": "A vulnerability in the nginx configurations that are provided as part of the VPN-less reverse proxy for Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition for new and existing users who are connected through a load balancer. This vulnerability is due to improper IP address filtering by the reverse proxy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of unauthenticated requests to the reverse proxy. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all current traffic and subsequent requests to the reverse proxy through a load balancer to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20088", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbFinesseVersions  before (<) 12.6\\(1\\)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:finesse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFinesse\u00bbVersion:12.6(1)cpe:2.3:a:cisco:finesse:12.6\\(1\\):-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFinesse\u00bbVersion:12.6(1)UpdateEs01cpe:2.3:a:cisco:finesse:12.6\\(1\\):es01:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFinesse\u00bbVersion:12.6(1)UpdateEs02cpe:2.3:a:cisco:finesse:12.6\\(1\\):es02:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbFinesse\u00bbVersion:12.6(1)UpdateEs03cpe:2.3:a:cisco:finesse:12.6\\(1\\):es03:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-23  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-13  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-09  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-02-01  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.05%  -1.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-finesse-proxy-dos-vY5dQhrV", "ref_desc": "Cisco Finesse Reverse Proxy VPN-less Access to Finesse Desktop Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
