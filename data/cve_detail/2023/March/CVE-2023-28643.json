{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28643", "Description": "Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions when a recipient receives 2 shares with the same name, while a memory cache is configured, the second share will replace the first one instead of being renamed to `{name} (2)`. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.3 or 24.0.9. Users unable to upgrade should avoid sharing 2 folders with the same name to the same user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28643", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.9cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 24.0.0andbefore (<) 24.0.9cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.0andbefore (<) 25.0.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bb     EnterpriseEditionVersions  from including (>=) 25.0.0andbefore (<) 25.0.3cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-18  0.16%  0.20%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-04  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-10-20  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-05  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 5  2024-02-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-02-04  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-04-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/706/Use-of-Incorrectly-Resolved-Name-or-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-hhq4-4pr8-wm27", "ref_desc": "Potential share collision for recipients when caching is enabled \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/34015", "ref_desc": "[Bug]: Name collision of shared folders \u00b7 Issue #34015 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/36047", "ref_desc": "fix cache key used to verify shared mountpoints by icewind1991 \u00b7 Pull Request #36047 \u00b7 nextcloud/server \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
