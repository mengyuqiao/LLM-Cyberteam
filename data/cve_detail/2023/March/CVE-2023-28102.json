{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28102", "Description": "discordrb is an implementation of the Discord API using Ruby. In discordrb before commit `91e13043ffa` the `encoder.rb` file unsafely constructs a shell string using the file parameter, which can potentially leave clients of discordrb vulnerable to command injection. The library is not directly exploitable: the exploit requires that some client of the library calls the vulnerable method with user input. However, if unsafe input reaches the library method, then an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine. Full impact will depend on the permissions of the process running the `discordrb` library and will likely not be total system access. This issue has been addressed in code, but a new release of the `discordrb` gem has not been uploaded to rubygems. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2022-094`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28102", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDiscordrb Project\u00bbDiscordrb\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 2023-03-08cpe:2.3:a:discordrb_project:discordrb:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-29  0.17%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-11-01  0.17%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-17  0.13%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-09-06  0.13%  0.13%  0.00 \n 5  2024-04-02  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-04-04  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb/commit/91e13043ffa89227c3fcdc3408f06da237d28c95", "ref_desc": "fix: switch popen to use an array invocation \u00b7 shardlab/discordrb@91e1304 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-094_discordrb/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2022-094: Remote Code Execution in discordrb - CVE-2023-28102 | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
