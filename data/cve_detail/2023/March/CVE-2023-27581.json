{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27581", "Description": "github-slug-action is a GitHub Action to expose slug value of GitHub environment variables inside of one's GitHub workflow. Starting in version 4.0.0` and prior to version 4.4.1, this action uses the `github.head_ref` parameter in an insecure way. This vulnerability can be triggered by any user on GitHub on any workflow using the action on pull requests. They just need to create a pull request with a branch name, which can contain the attack payload. This can be used to execute code on the GitHub runners and to exfiltrate any secrets one uses in the CI pipeline. A patched action is available in version 4.4.1. No workaround is available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27581", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGithub-slug-action Project\u00bbGithub-slug-actionVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.4.1cpe:2.3:a:github-slug-action_project:github-slug-action:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-30  0.17%  0.18%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-11-01  0.14%  0.17%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-10-18  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-10-03  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 5  2024-03-19  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-02-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-18  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/commit/102b1a064a9b145e56556e22b18b19c624538d94", "ref_desc": "fix: use github.head_ref env var as trusted input \u00b7 rlespinasse/github-slug-action@102b1a0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/", "ref_desc": "Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 2: Untrusted input | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cnUbNXWMpwLVHiT6fB5Xtz4U36s.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/releases/tag/v4.4.1", "ref_desc": "Release v4.4.1 \u00b7 rlespinasse/github-slug-action \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/security/advisories/GHSA-6q4m-7476-932w", "ref_desc": "github-slug-action vulnerable to arbitrary code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rlespinasse/github-slug-action \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
