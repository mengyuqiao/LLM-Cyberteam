{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28116", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things (IoT) devices. In versions 4.8 and prior, an out-of-bounds write can occur in the BLE L2CAP module of the Contiki-NG operating system. The network stack of Contiki-NG uses a global buffer (packetbuf) for processing of packets, with the size of PACKETBUF_SIZE. In particular, when using the BLE L2CAP module with the default configuration, the PACKETBUF_SIZE value becomes larger then the actual size of the packetbuf. When large packets are processed by the L2CAP module, a buffer overflow can therefore occur when copying the packet data to the packetbuf. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be worked around by applying the patch manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28116", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-07  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-27  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-18  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-23  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-15  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-07-08  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-06-24  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-25  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2398", "ref_desc": "Prevent buffer overflows due to misconfigured BLE MTU. by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #2398 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-m737-4vx6-pfqp", "ref_desc": "Buffer overflow in L2CAP due to misconfigured MTU \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
