{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27587", "Description": "ReadtoMyShoe, a web app that lets users upload articles and listen to them later, generates an error message containing sensitive information prior to commit 8533b01. If an error occurs when adding an article, the website shows the user an error message. If the error originates from the Google Cloud TTS request, then it will include the full URL of the request. The request URL contains the Google Cloud API key. This has been patched in commit 8533b01. Upgrading should be accompanied by deleting the current GCP API key and issuing a new one. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27587", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nReadtomyshoe Project\u00bbReadtomyshoeVersions  before (<) 2023-03-13cpe:2.3:a:readtomyshoe_project:readtomyshoe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "14.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-01  12.41%  14.38%  +1.97 \n 2  2024-10-18  14.64%  12.41%  -2.23 \n 3  2024-10-03  14.38%  14.64%  +0.25 \n 4  2024-09-20  14.87%  14.38%  -0.48 \n 5  2024-08-23  17.20%  14.87%  -2.34 \n 6  2024-07-27  17.23%  17.20%  -0.03 \n 7  2024-06-04  16.54%  17.23%  +0.69 \n 8  2024-05-22  17.32%  16.54%  -0.78 \n 9  2024-05-09  22.62%  17.32%  -5.30 \n 10  2024-04-01  18.81%  22.62%  +3.81 \n 11  2024-03-19  21.57%  18.81%  -2.76 \n 12  2024-03-08  18.69%  21.57%  +2.87 \n 13  2024-02-11  16.39%  18.69%  +2.30 \n 14  2024-01-18  21.22%  16.39%  -4.83 \n 15  2024-01-07  25.27%  21.22%  -4.05 \n 16  2023-12-26  27.67%  25.27%  -2.40 \n 17  2023-11-23  30.44%  27.67%  -2.77 \n 18  2023-11-10  25.54%  30.44%  +4.90 \n 19  2023-10-30  23.77%  25.54%  +1.77 \n 20  2023-10-20  19.36%  23.77%  +4.40 \n 21  2023-09-26  15.03%  19.36%  +4.34 \n 22  2023-09-18  9.89%  15.03%  +5.14 \n 23  2023-09-03  11.30%  9.89%  -1.41 \n 24  2023-08-24  11.55%  11.30%  -0.25 \n 25  2023-08-16  13.71%  11.55%  -2.17 \n 26  2023-07-08  40.96%  13.71%  -27.25 \n 27  2023-06-28  44.25%  40.96%  -3.29 \n 28  2023-06-20  39.03%  44.25%  +5.22 \n 29  2023-05-18  37.07%  39.03%  +1.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rozbb/readtomyshoe/security/advisories/GHSA-23g5-r34j-mr8g", "ref_desc": "API key leak \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rozbb/readtomyshoe \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rozbb/readtomyshoe/commit/8533b01c818939a0fa919c7244d8dbf5daf032af", "ref_desc": "Fixed leakage of GCP API key through TTS error message \u00b7 rozbb/readtomyshoe@8533b01 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
