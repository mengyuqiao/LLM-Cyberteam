{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27478", "Description": "libmemcached-awesome is an open source C/C++ client library and tools for the memcached server. `libmemcached` could return data for a previously requested key, if that previous request timed out due to a low `POLL_TIMEOUT`. This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are several ways to workaround or lower the probability of this bug affecting a given deployment. 1: use a reasonably high `POLL_TIMEOUT` setting, like the default. 2: use separate libmemcached connections for unrelated data. 3: do not re-use libmemcached connections in an unknown state.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27478", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nAwesome\u00bbLibmemcachedVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.18andbefore (<) 1.1.4cpe:2.3:a:awesome:libmemcached:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-27  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/security/advisories/GHSA-wwmh-39wj-fx59", "ref_desc": "Disclosure of unrelated data \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 awesomized/libmemcached \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/releases/tag/1.1.4", "ref_desc": "Release v 1.1.4 \u00b7 awesomized/libmemcached \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/php-memcached-dev/php-memcached/issues/531", "ref_desc": "get returns random values when lower than default OPT_POLL_TIMEOUT is set \u00b7 Issue #531 \u00b7 php-memcached-dev/php-memcached \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/commit/48dcc61a", "ref_desc": "revert most of d7a0084bf99d618d1dc26a54fd413db7ae8b8e63 \u00b7 awesomized/libmemcached@48dcc61 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
