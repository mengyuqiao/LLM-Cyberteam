{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27582", "Description": "maddy is a composable, all-in-one mail server. Starting with version 0.2.0 and prior to version 0.6.3, maddy allows a full authentication bypass if SASL authorization username is specified when using the PLAIN authentication mechanisms. Instead of validating the specified username, it is accepted as is after checking the credentials for the authentication username. maddy 0.6.3 includes the fix for the bug. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27582", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMaddy Project\u00bbMaddyVersions  from including (>=) 0.2.0andbefore (<) 0.6.3cpe:2.3:a:maddy_project:maddy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-01  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-10-03  0.19%  0.18%  0.00 \n 4  2024-08-23  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-04-14  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-03-19  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 7  2024-02-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-18  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-305 Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/305/Authentication-Bypass-by-Primary-Weakness.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy/security/advisories/GHSA-4g76-w3xw-2x6w", "ref_desc": "Full authentication bypass if SASL authorization username is specified \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 foxcpp/maddy \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy/commit/9f58cb64b39cdc01928ec463bdb198c4c2313a9c", "ref_desc": "auth: Actually check SASL identity argument before using it \u00b7 foxcpp/maddy@9f58cb6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy/releases/tag/v0.6.3", "ref_desc": "Release maddy 0.6.3 \u00b7 foxcpp/maddy \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy/commit/55a91a37b71210f34f98f4d327c30308fe24399a", "ref_desc": "Revert authorization/authentication split \u00b7 foxcpp/maddy@55a91a3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
