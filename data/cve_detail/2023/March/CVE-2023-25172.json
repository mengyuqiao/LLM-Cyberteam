{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25172", "Description": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a maliciously crafted URL can be included in a user's full name field to to carry out cross-site scripting attacks on sites with a disabled or overly permissive CSP (Content Security Policy). Discourse's default CSP prevents this vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, enable and/or restore your site's CSP to the default one provided with Discourse.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25172", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     StableEditionVersions  before (<) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:stable:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     BetaEditionVersions  before (<) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.1.0UpdateBeta1   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.1.0:beta1:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-07  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-21  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-03-23  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/20009", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Prevent XSS in local oneboxes by nbianca \u00b7 Pull Request #20009 \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/1a5a6f66cb821ed29a737311d6fdc2eba5adc915", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Prevent XSS in local oneboxes (#20009) \u00b7 discourse/discourse@1a5a6f6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/c186a46910431020e8efc425dec2133e7a99fa9a", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Prevent XSS in local oneboxes (#20008) \u00b7 discourse/discourse@c186a46 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/20008", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Prevent XSS in local oneboxes by nbianca \u00b7 Pull Request #20008 \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-7pm2-prxw-wrvp", "ref_desc": "XSS user name displayed on post \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
