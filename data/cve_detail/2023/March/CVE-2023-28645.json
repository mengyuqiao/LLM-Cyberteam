{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28645", "Description": "Nextcloud richdocuments is a Nextcloud app integrating the office suit Collabora Online. In affected versions the secure view feature of the rich documents app can be bypassed by using unprotected internal API endpoint of the rich documents app. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Office app (richdocuments) is upgraded to 8.0.0-beta.1, 7.0.2 or 6.3.2. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the issue by taking steps to restrict the ability to download documents. This includes ensuring that the `WOPI configuration` is configured to only serve documents between Nextcloud and Collabora. It is highly recommended to define the list of Collabora server IPs as the allow list within the Office admin settings of Nextcloud.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28645", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbRichdocumentsVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.2cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:richdocuments:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbRichdocumentsVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.3.2cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:richdocuments:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.10%  0.09%  0.00 \n 3  2024-04-06  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-29  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-08  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-95j6-p5cj-5hh5", "ref_desc": "Secure view can be bypassed by using internal API endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/richdocuments/pull/2604", "ref_desc": "Show warning if \"WOPI allow-list\" not configured by Raudius \u00b7 Pull Request #2604 \u00b7 nextcloud/richdocuments \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/office/configuration.html#wopi-settings", "ref_desc": "Configuration \u2014 Nextcloud latest Administration Manual latest documentationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
