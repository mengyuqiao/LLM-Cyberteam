{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26488", "Description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The ERC721Consecutive contract designed for minting NFTs in batches does not update balances when a batch has size 1 and consists of a single token. Subsequent transfers from the receiver of that token may overflow the balance as reported by `balanceOf`. The issue exclusively presents with batches of size 1. The issue has been patched in 4.8.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26488", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.8.0andbefore (<) 4.8.2cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nOpenzeppelin\u00bbContracts Upgradeable\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 4.8.0andbefore (<) 4.8.2cpe:2.3:a:openzeppelin:contracts_upgradeable:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-09  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-682 Incorrect Calculation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/682/Incorrect-Calculation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/167bf67ed3907f4a674043496019fa346cee7705", "ref_desc": "Fix ERC721Consecutive balance update on batch size 1 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@167bf67 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-878m-3g6q-594q", "ref_desc": "ERC721Consecutive incorrect balance update with batch of 1 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.8.2", "ref_desc": "Release v4.8.2 \u00b7 OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
