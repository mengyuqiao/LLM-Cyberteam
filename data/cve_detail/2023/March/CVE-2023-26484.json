{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26484", "Description": "KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In versions 0.59.0 and prior, if a malicious user has taken over a Kubernetes node where virt-handler (the KubeVirt node-daemon) is running, the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all node specs. This can be misused to lure-in system-level-privileged components which can, for instance, read all secrets on the cluster, or can exec into pods on other nodes. This way, a compromised node can be used to elevate privileges beyond the node until potentially having full privileged access to the whole cluster. The simplest way to exploit this, once a user could compromise a specific node, is to set with the virt-handler service account all other nodes to unschedulable and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges appear on its node. No patches are available as of time of publication. As a workaround, gatekeeper users can add a webhook which will block the `virt-handler` service account to modify the spec of a node.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26484", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKubevirt\u00bbKubevirt\u00bbForKubernetesVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.59.0cpe:2.3:a:kubevirt:kubevirt:*:*:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2024-03-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-13  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/security/advisories/GHSA-cp96-jpmq-xrr2", "ref_desc": "On a compromised node, the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all node specs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kubevirt/kubevirt \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/9109", "ref_desc": "A potential risk of kubevirt makes a worker node get the cluster's admin secret. \u00b7 Issue #9109 \u00b7 kubevirt/kubevirt \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
