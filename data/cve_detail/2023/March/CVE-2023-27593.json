{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27593", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Prior to versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1, an attacker with access to a Cilium agent pod can write to `/opt/cni/bin` due to a `hostPath` mount of that directory in the agent pod. By replacing the CNI binary with their own malicious binary and waiting for the creation of a new pod on the node, the attacker can gain access to the underlying node. The issue has been fixed and the fix is available on versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1. Some workarounds are available. Kubernetes RBAC should be used to deny users and service accounts `exec` access to Cilium agent pods. In cases where a user requires `exec` access to Cilium agent pods, but should not have access to the underlying node, no workaround is possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27593", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.8cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  before (<) 1.11.15cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.1cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-25  0.04%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/276/Incorrect-Default-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-4hc4-pgfx-3mrx", "ref_desc": "cilium-agent container can access the host via `hostPath` mount \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.12.8", "ref_desc": "Release 1.12.8 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/doKXhanqDj7EcIAumtYQmjiW04E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.11.15", "ref_desc": "Release 1.11.15 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/I-Rjsl3B0fHeFaSueOVi6NM8AbQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.13.1", "ref_desc": "Release 1.13.1 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jjPxFdYqipnigeFIt6tfrinAcRc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/", "ref_desc": "Using RBAC Authorization | KubernetesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/24075", "ref_desc": "agent: install CNI plugin binary in an InitContainer by squeed \u00b7 Pull Request #24075 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
