{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25169", "Description": "discourse-yearly-review is a discourse plugin which publishes an automated Year in Review topic. In affected versions a user present in a yearly review topic that is then anonymised will still have some data linked to its original account. This issue has been patched in commit `b3ab33bbf7` which is included in the latest version of the Discourse Yearly Review plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the `yearly_review_enabled` setting to fully mitigate the issue. Also, it's possible to edit the anonymised user's old data in the yearly review topics manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25169", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse Yearly Review\u00bbForDiscourseVersions  before (<) 0.2cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse_yearly_review:*:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-26  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-14  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/commit/b3ab33bbf7130fca54764cf0336395a8a1eeaf3c", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: update old username when the user is anonymized.
