{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20072", "Description": "A vulnerability in the fragmentation handling code of tunnel protocol packets in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of large fragmented tunnel protocol packets. One example of a tunnel protocol is Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted fragmented packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20072", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:17.9.1cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:17.9.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:17.9.1acpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:17.9.1a:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbIos Xe\u00bbVersion:17.9.1wcpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:17.9.1w:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-13  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-02  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-29  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-02-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-gre-crash-p6nE5Sq5", "ref_desc": "Cisco IOS XE Software Fragmented Tunnel Protocol Packet Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
