{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20107", "Description": "A vulnerability in the deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), also known as pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco ASA 5506-X, ASA 5508-X, and ASA 5516-X Firewalls could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a cryptographic collision, enabling the attacker to discover the private key of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient entropy in the DRBG for the affected hardware platforms when generating cryptographic keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a large number of cryptographic keys on an affected device and looking for collisions with target devices. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate an affected target device or to decrypt traffic secured by an affected key that is sent to or from an affected target device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20107", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbAdaptive Security ApplianceVersions  before (<) 9.12.1cpe:2.3:a:cisco:adaptive_security_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5506-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5506h-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5506w-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5508-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5516-x\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbFirepower Threat DefenseVersions  before (<) 6.4.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5506-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5506h-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5506w-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5508-x\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbAsa 5516-x\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-02  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-24  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 5  2024-03-29  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 6  2024-02-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-04-06  0.05%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/331/Insufficient-Entropy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-332 Insufficient Entropy in PRNG", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/332/Insufficient-Entropy-in-PRNG.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa5500x-entropy-6v9bHVYP", "ref_desc": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software Low-Entropy Keys VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
