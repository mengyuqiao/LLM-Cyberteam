{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26046", "Description": "teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS functionality to protect against web-based attacks. In teler-waf prior to version 0.1.1 is vulnerable to bypassing common web attack rules when a specific HTML entities payload is used. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application. The vulnerability exists due to teler-waf failure to properly sanitize and filter HTML entities in user input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens, or take control of the victim's browser and perform malicious actions. This issue has been fixed in version 0.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26046", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nKitabisa\u00bbTeler-wafVersions  before (<) 0.1.1cpe:2.3:a:kitabisa:teler-waf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-22  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-12  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-03  0.07%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-03-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-01-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-10  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf/commit/d1d49cfddfa3ec2adad962870f14b85cd1aaf739", "ref_desc": "feat: unescape any HTML entities \u00b7 kitabisa/teler-waf@d1d49cf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf/releases/tag/v0.1.1", "ref_desc": "Release v0.1.1 \u00b7 kitabisa/teler-waf \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf/security/advisories/GHSA-9f95-hhg4-pg4f", "ref_desc": "Bypass Common Web Attack Threat Rule with HTML Entities Payload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kitabisa/teler-waf \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
