{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27594", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Prior to versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1, under specific conditions, Cilium may misattribute the source IP address of traffic to a cluster, identifying external traffic as coming from the host on which Cilium is running. As a consequence, network policies for that cluster might be bypassed, depending on the specific network policies enabled. This issue only manifests when Cilium is routing IPv6 traffic and NodePorts are used to route traffic to pods. IPv6 and endpoint routes are both disabled by default. The problem has been fixed and is available on versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1. As a workaround, disable IPv6 routing.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27594", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.12.0andbefore (<) 1.12.8cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  before (<) 1.11.15cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.1cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-07  0.13%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-08-27  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-18  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-23  0.06%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.12.8", "ref_desc": "Release 1.12.8 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/doKXhanqDj7EcIAumtYQmjiW04E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.11.15", "ref_desc": "Release 1.11.15 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/I-Rjsl3B0fHeFaSueOVi6NM8AbQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.13.1", "ref_desc": "Release 1.13.1 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jjPxFdYqipnigeFIt6tfrinAcRc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-8fg8-jh2h-f2hc", "ref_desc": "Potential network policy bypass when routing IPv6 traffic \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
