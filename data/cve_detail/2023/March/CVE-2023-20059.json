{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20059", "Description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Cisco Network Plug-and-Play (PnP) agent of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text. The attacker must have valid low-privileged user credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) with the integration of PnP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and sending a query to an internal API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in clear text, which could include configuration files.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20059", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbDna CenterVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.4.0andbefore (<) 2.3.5.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:dna_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbDna CenterVersions  before (<) 2.3.3.7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:dna_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-29  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-02-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-31  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-555 J2EE Misconfiguration: Plaintext Password in Configuration File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/555/J2EE-Misconfiguration-Plaintext-Password-in-Configuration-F.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dnac-infodisc-pe7zAbdR", "ref_desc": "Cisco DNA Center Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
