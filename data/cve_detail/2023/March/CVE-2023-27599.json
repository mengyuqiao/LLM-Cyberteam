{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27599", "Description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, when the function `append_hf` handles a SIP message with a malformed To header, a call to the function `abort()` is performed, resulting in a crash. This is due to the following check in `data_lump.c:399` in the function `anchor_lump`. An attacker abusing this vulnerability will crash OpenSIPS leading to Denial of Service. It affects configurations containing functions that make use of the affected code, such as the function `append_hf`. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27599", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.4cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  before (<) 3.1.7cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-10-05  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-08-25  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-06-19  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 6  2024-04-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-03-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-02-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/cb56694d290530ac308f44b453c18120b1c1109d", "ref_desc": "[sipmsgops] fix parse_to_param() parsing \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips@cb56694 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-qvj2-vqrg-f5jx", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in the parse_to_param() function \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/N7I_gvY1V8PDIGhrAtX6_M_mTgE.html"}]}
