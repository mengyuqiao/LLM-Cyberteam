{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25809", "Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. In affected versions it was found that rootless runc makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons: 1. when runc is executed inside the user namespace, and the `config.json` does not specify the cgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g.., `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host`, with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or 2. when runc is executed outside the user namespace, and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro` (e.g., `runc spec --rootless`; this condition is very rare). A container may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host . Other users's cgroup hierarchies are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade may unshare the cgroup namespace (`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts. or add `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25809", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbRuncVersions  before (<) 1.1.5cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:runc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-19  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-m8cg-xc2p-r3fc", "ref_desc": "rootless: `/sys/fs/cgroup` is writable when cgroupns isn't unshared \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opencontainers/runc \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0d62b950e60f6980b54fe3bafd9a9c608dc1df17", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-m8cg-xc2p-r3fc \u00b7 opencontainers/runc@0d62b95 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
