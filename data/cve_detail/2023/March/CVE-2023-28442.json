{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28442", "Description": "GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. Prior to versions 2.20.6, 2.19.6, and 2.18.7, anonymous users can obtain sensitive information about GeoNode configurations from the response of the `/geoserver/rest/about/status` Geoserver REST API endpoint. The Geoserver endpoint is secured by default, but the configuration of Geoserver for GeoNode opens a list of REST endpoints to support some of its public-facing services. The vulnerability impacts both GeoNode 3 and GeoNode 4 instances. Geoserver security configuration is provided by `geoserver-geonode-ext`. A patch for 2.20.7 has been released which blocks access to the affected endpoint. The patch has been backported to branches 2.20.6, 2.19.7, 2.19.6, and 2.18.7. All the published artifacts and Docker images have been updated accordingly. A more advanced patch has been applied to the master and development versions, which require some changes to GeoNode code. They will be available with the next 4.1.0 release. The patched configuration only has an effect on new deployments. For existing setups, the patch must be applied manually inside the Geoserver data directory. The patched file must replace the existing `<geoserver_datadir>/security/rest.properties` file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28442", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGeosolutionsgroup\u00bbGeonodeVersions  before (<) 2.18.7cpe:2.3:a:geosolutionsgroup:geonode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGeosolutionsgroup\u00bbGeonodeVersions  from including (>=) 2.19.0andbefore (<) 2.19.6cpe:2.3:a:geosolutionsgroup:geonode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGeosolutionsgroup\u00bbGeonodeVersions  from including (>=) 2.20.0andbefore (<) 2.20.6cpe:2.3:a:geosolutionsgroup:geonode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-13  0.14%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-02  0.19%  0.14%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-04-24  0.24%  0.19%  -0.06 \n 4  2024-03-29  0.19%  0.24%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-02-21  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-10  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-04-01  0.05%  0.13%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/GeoNode/geoserver-geonode-ext/commit/f44cb074d8361c0f4e625013675bdd7bd8203df6", "ref_desc": "only close the status endpoint to support GN <=4.0.3 (#159) \u00b7 GeoNode/geoserver-geonode-ext@f44cb07 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/security/advisories/GHSA-87mh-vw7c-5v6w", "ref_desc": "Geoserver for GeoNode sensitive information leak \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 GeoNode/geonode \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GeoNode/geoserver-geonode-ext/blob/2.20.7/data/security/rest.properties", "ref_desc": "geoserver-geonode-ext/rest.properties at 2.20.7 \u00b7 GeoNode/geoserver-geonode-ext \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
