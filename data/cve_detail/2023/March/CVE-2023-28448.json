{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28448", "Description": "Versionize is a framework for version tolerant serializion/deserialization of Rust data structures, designed for usecases that need fast deserialization times and minimal size overhead. An issue was discovered in the \u2018Versionize::deserialize\u2019 implementation provided by the \u2018versionize\u2019 crate for \u2018vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper', which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The impact started with version 0.1.1. The issue was corrected in version 0.1.10 by inserting a check that verifies, for any deserialized header, the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal and aborting deserialization otherwise.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28448", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVersionize Project\u00bbVersionize\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.1.1andbefore (<) 0.1.10cpe:2.3:a:versionize_project:versionize:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-29  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-10-14  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-09-03  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-03-30  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-04-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize/pull/53", "ref_desc": "Add missing bounds check to `<FamStructWrapper as Versionize>::deserialize` by roypat \u00b7 Pull Request #53 \u00b7 firecracker-microvm/versionize \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize/commit/a57a051ba006cfa3b41a0532f484df759e008d47", "ref_desc": "Add missing bounds check to FamStructWrapper::deserialize \u00b7 firecracker-microvm/versionize@a57a051 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize/security/advisories/GHSA-8vxc-r5wp-vgvc", "ref_desc": "Versionize::deserialize implementation for FamStructWrapper<T> is lacking bound checks, potentially leading to out of bounds memory accesses \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 firecracker-microvm/versionize \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
