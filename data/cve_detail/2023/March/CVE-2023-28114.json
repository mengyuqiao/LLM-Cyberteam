{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28114", "Description": "`cilium-cli` is the command line interface to install, manage, and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters running Cilium. Prior to version 0.13.2,`cilium-cli`, when used to configure cluster mesh functionality, can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote clusters. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected by this issue. Due to an incorrect mount point specification, the settings specified by the `initContainer` that configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that `etcd` cluster. This issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2. As a workaround, one may use Cilium's Helm charts to create their cluster.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28114", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCilium-cliVersions  before (<) 0.13.2cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium-cli:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "4.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-280 Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/280/Improper-Handling-of-Insufficient-Permissions-or-Privileges-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/security/advisories/GHSA-6f27-3p6c-p5jc", "ref_desc": "`cilium-cli` disables etcd authorization for clustermesh clusters \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium-cli \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/commit/fb1427025764e1eebc4a7710d902c4f22cae2610", "ref_desc": "clustermesh: correctly mount the etcd data dir in the init container \u00b7 cilium/cilium-cli@fb14270 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cilium/cilium", "ref_desc": "Product", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/releases/tag/v0.13.2", "ref_desc": "Release Release v0.13.2 \u00b7 cilium/cilium-cli \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
