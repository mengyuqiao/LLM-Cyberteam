{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27477", "Description": "wasmtime is a fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime's code generation backend, Cranelift, has a bug on x86_64 platforms for the WebAssembly `i8x16.select` instruction which will produce the wrong results when the same operand is provided to the instruction and some of the selected indices are greater than 16. There is an off-by-one error in the calculation of the mask to the `pshufb` instruction which causes incorrect results to be returned if lanes are selected from the second vector. This codegen bug has been fixed in Wasmtiem 6.0.1, 5.0.1, and 4.0.1. Users are recommended to upgrade to these updated versions. If upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can avoid this miscompilation by disabling the Wasm simd proposal. Additionally the bug is only present on x86_64 hosts. Other platforms such as AArch64 and s390x are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27477", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBytecodealliance\u00bbCranelift-codegen\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.84.0andbefore (<) 0.91.1cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:cranelift-codegen:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBytecodealliance\u00bbCranelift-codegen\u00bbVersion:0.93.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:cranelift-codegen:0.93.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBytecodealliance\u00bbCranelift-codegen\u00bbVersion:0.92.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:cranelift-codegen:0.92.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.37.0andbefore (<) 4.0.1cpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbVersion:6.0.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:6.0.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nBytecodealliance\u00bbWasmtime\u00bbVersion:5.0.0ForRustcpe:2.3:a:bytecodealliance:wasmtime:5.0.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-28  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-12  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-03-14  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-02-06  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-03-16  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-193 Off-by-one Error", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/193/Off-by-one-Error.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-xm67-587q-r2vw", "ref_desc": "Miscompilation of `i8x16.select` with the same inputs on x86_64 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/a/bytecodealliance.org/g/sec-announce/c/Mov-ItrNJsQ", "ref_desc": "Upcoming security release for WasmtimeMailing List;Release Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7lClEZkR93OKjQZ51UTd3ytPsxI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_simd", "ref_desc": "Config in wasmtime - RustProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fqiIlTbYL7kN2434fGEWd-90WHk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/webassembly/simd", "ref_desc": "GitHub - WebAssembly/simd: Branch of the spec repo scoped to discussion of SIMD in WebAssemblyNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jiMQ22dvMDu-Gj6A6q-z4wPDqbM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/5dc2bbccbb363e474d2c9a1b8e38a89a43bbd5d1", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-xm67-587q-r2vw \u00b7 bytecodealliance/wasmtime@5dc2bbc \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
