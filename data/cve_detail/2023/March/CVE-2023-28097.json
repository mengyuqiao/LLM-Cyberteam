{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28097", "Description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, a malformed SIP message containing a large _Content-Length_ value and a specially crafted Request-URI causes a segmentation fault in OpenSIPS. This issue occurs when a large amount of shared memory using the `-m` flag was allocated to OpenSIPS, such as 10 GB of RAM. On the test system, this issue occurred when shared memory was set to `2362` or higher. This issue is fixed in versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6. The only workaround is to guarantee that the Content-Length value of input messages is never larger than `2147483647`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28097", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 3.2.6cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOpensips\u00bbOpensipsVersions  before (<) 3.1.9cpe:2.3:a:opensips:opensips:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-03  0.12%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-10-05  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-08-25  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-16  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-02-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-c6j5-f4h4-2xrq", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in the Content-Length Parser \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/N7I_gvY1V8PDIGhrAtX6_M_mTgE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/7cab422e2fc648f910abba34f3f0dbb3ae171ff5", "ref_desc": "core: Fix Content-Length parsing \u00b7 OpenSIPS/opensips@7cab422 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
