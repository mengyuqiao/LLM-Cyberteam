{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24824", "Description": "cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering library and program in C. A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues when parsing text which leads with either large numbers of `>` or `-` characters. This issue has been addressed in version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should validate that their input comes from trusted sources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24824", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbCmark-gfmVersions  before (<) 0.29.0.gfm.10.cpe:2.3:a:github:cmark-gfm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-06  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-11  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-407 Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/407/Inefficient-Algorithmic-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/commit/2300c1bd2c8226108885bf019655c4159cf26b59", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-66g8-4hjf-77xh \u00b7 github/cmark-gfm@2300c1b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-66g8-4hjf-77xh", "ref_desc": "Quadratic complexity bugs may lead to a denial of service \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 github/cmark-gfm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
