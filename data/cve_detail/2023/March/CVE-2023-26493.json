{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26493", "Description": "Cocos Engine is an open-source framework for building 2D & 3D real-time rendering and interactive content. In the github repo for Cocos Engine the `web-interface-check.yml` was subject to command injection. The `web-interface-check.yml` was triggered when a pull request was opened or updated and contained the user controllable field `(${{ github.head_ref }} \u2013 the name of the fork\u2019s branch)`. This would allow an attacker to take over the GitHub Runner and run custom commands (potentially stealing secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN) and altering the repository. The workflow has since been removed for the repository. There are no actions required of users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26493", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCocos\u00bbCocos-engineVersions  before (<) 2023-02-20cpe:2.3:a:cocos:cocos-engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-11-01  0.16%  0.21%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-10-17  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-09-06  0.14%  0.13%  0.00 \n 5  2024-04-02  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-02-25  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-02-01  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-10-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-04-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine/commit/6d06aefa2684e20da79e7ceaf41f728c1a8d7a41", "ref_desc": "remove interface check workflow (#14281) \u00b7 cocos/cocos-engine@6d06aef \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-027_Engine_for_Cocos_Creator/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-027: Command Injection in Cocos - CVE-2023-26493 | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine/blob/2362df28a4b3016dbda804899041279701929728/.github/workflows/web-interface-check.yml", "ref_desc": "cocos-engine/web-interface-check.yml at 2362df28a4b3016dbda804899041279701929728 \u00b7 cocos/cocos-engine \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
