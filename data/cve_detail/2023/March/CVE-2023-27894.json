{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27894", "Description": "SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Web Services) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values as CMS parameters to perform lookups on the internal network which is otherwise not accessible externally. On successful exploitation, attacker can scan internal network to determine internal infrastructure for further attacks like remote file inclusion, retrieve server files, bypass firewall and force the vulnerable server to execute malicious requests, resulting in sensitive information disclosure. This causes limited impact on confidentiality of data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27894", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbBusinessobjects Business Intelligence\u00bbVersion:420cpe:2.3:a:sap:businessobjects_business_intelligence:420:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbBusinessobjects Business Intelligence\u00bbVersion:430cpe:2.3:a:sap:businessobjects_business_intelligence:430:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-04  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-24  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-15  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-03-20  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-02-12  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-21  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3287120", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions RequiredCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nMTwstOIPtsQHPsbbj128bGBoH0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/02/fa865ea4-167e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html", "ref_desc": "SAP Patch Day BlogVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sSrRPvgCRYFgD7GfxMc3pkzb8gk.html"}]}
