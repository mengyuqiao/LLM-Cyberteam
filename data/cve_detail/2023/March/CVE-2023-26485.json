{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26485", "Description": "cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering library and program in C. A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues when parsing text which leads with either large numbers of `_` characters. This issue has been addressed in version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should validate that their input comes from trusted sources. ### Impact A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. ### Proof of concept ``` $ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c 'pad = \"_\" * 100000; print(pad + \".\" + pad, end=\"\")' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext ``` Increasing the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time to increase quadratically. ### Patches This vulnerability have been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.10. ### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm XXX: TBD [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) is a fork of [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) that adds the GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over time, but share a common core. These bugs affect both `cmark` and `cmark-gfm`. ### Credit We would like to thank @gravypod for reporting this vulnerability. ### References https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [github/cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26485", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbCmark-gfmVersions  before (<) 0.29.0.gfm.10cpe:2.3:a:github:cmark-gfm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-05-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-04-06  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-29  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-11  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-407 Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/407/Inefficient-Algorithmic-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/commit/07a66c9bc341f902878e37d7da8647d6ef150987", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-r8vr-c48j-fcc5 \u00b7 github/cmark-gfm@07a66c9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-r8vr-c48j-fcc5", "ref_desc": "Quadratic complexity bug may lead to a denial of service \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 github/cmark-gfm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
