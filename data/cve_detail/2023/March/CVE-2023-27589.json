{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27589", "Description": "Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Starting with RELEASE.2020-12-23T02-24-12Z and prior to RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z, a user with `consoleAdmin` permissions can potentially create a user that matches the root credential `accessKey`. Once this user is created successfully, the root credential ceases to work appropriately. The issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z. There are ways to work around this via adding higher privileges to the disabled root user via `mc admin policy set`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27589", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMinio\u00bbMinioVersions  from including (>=) 2020-12-23t02-24-12zandbefore (<) 2023-03-13t19-46-17zcpe:2.3:a:minio:minio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-04  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-20  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-22  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-9wfv-wmf7-6753", "ref_desc": "Denial of access by an admin privileged user for root credential \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/16803", "ref_desc": "Do not allow adding root user to IAM subsystem by harshavardhana \u00b7 Pull Request #16803 \u00b7 minio/minio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
