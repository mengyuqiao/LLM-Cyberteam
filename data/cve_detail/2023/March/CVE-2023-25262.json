{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25262", "Description": "Stimulsoft GmbH Stimulsoft Designer (Web) 2023.1.3 is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). TThe Reporting Designer (Web) offers the possibility to embed sources from external locations. If the user chooses an external location, the request to that resource is performed by the server rather than the client. Therefore, the server causes outbound traffic and potentially imports data. An attacker may also leverage this behaviour to exfiltrate data of machines on the internal network of the server hosting the Stimulsoft Reporting Designer (Web).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25262", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nStimulsoft\u00bbDesigner\u00bbVersion:2023.1.3    WEBEditioncpe:2.3:a:stimulsoft:designer:2023.1.3:*:*:*:web:*:*:*Matching versions\nStimulsoft\u00bbDesigner\u00bbVersion:2023.1.4    WEBEditioncpe:2.3:a:stimulsoft:designer:2023.1.4:*:*:*:web:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-18  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-07  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-29  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-04-03  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 5  2024-02-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-04-04  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://cves.at/posts/cve-2023-25262/writeup/", "ref_desc": "SSRF in Stimulsoft Designer - CVE-2023-25262 :: Vulnerability DisclosureExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://stimulsoft.com", "ref_desc": "Reporting tool for NET | ASP.NET | MVC | NET Core | Blazor | PHP | JavaScript | AngularVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qNnOyDoLiye9uaYhsdsWjB5L0H8.html"}]}
