{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-27494", "Description": "Streamlit, software for turning data scripts into web applications, had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in versions 0.63.0 through 0.80.0. Users of hosted Streamlit app(s) were vulnerable to a reflected XSS vulnerability. An attacker could craft a malicious URL with Javascript payloads to a Streamlit app. The attacker could then trick the user into visiting the malicious URL and, if successful, the server would render the malicious javascript payload as-is, leading to XSS. Version 0.81.0 contains a patch for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27494", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSnowflake\u00bbStreamlitVersions  from including (>=) 0.63.0andbefore (<) 0.81.0cpe:2.3:a:snowflake:streamlit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-26  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 6  2023-03-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/commit/afcf880c60e5d7538936cc2d9721b9e1bc02b075", "ref_desc": "Remove path from 404 response (#3165) \u00b7 streamlit/streamlit@afcf880 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/security/advisories/GHSA-9c6g-qpgj-rvxw", "ref_desc": "Streamlit publishes previously-patched XSS vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 streamlit/streamlit \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
