{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26470", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make the farm unusable by adding an object to a page with a huge number (e.g. 67108863). Most of the time this will fill the memory allocated to XWiki and make it unusable every time this document is manipulated.
