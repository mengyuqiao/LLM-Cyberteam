{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-26471", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 11.6-rc-1, comments are supposed to be executed with the right of superadmin but in restricted mode (anything dangerous is disabled), but the async macro does not take into account the restricted mode. This means that any user with comment right can use the async macro to make it execute any wiki content with the right of superadmin. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10. The only known workaround consists of applying a patch and rebuilding and redeploying `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-async-macro`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26471", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 11.6andbefore (<) 13.10.10cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14.4.6cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 14.5andbefore (<) 14.9cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:11.6UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:11.6:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.17%  0.21%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.13%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-22  0.12%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-08-12  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-03-08  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-01-31  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/00532d9f1404287cf3ec3a05056640d809516006", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-20234: It's possible to execute anything with superadmin right \u2026 \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@00532d9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-9cqm-5wf7-wcj7", "ref_desc": "It's possible to execute anything with superadmin right through comments and async macro \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20234", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
