{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-28629", "Description": "GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. GoCD versions before 23.1.0 are vulnerable to a stored XSS vulnerability, where pipeline configuration with a malicious pipeline label configuration can affect browser display of pipeline runs generated from that configuration. An attacker that has permissions to configure GoCD pipelines could include JavaScript elements within the label template, causing a XSS vulnerability to be triggered for any users viewing the Value Stream Map or Job Details for runs of the affected pipeline, potentially allowing them to perform arbitrary actions within the victim's browser context rather than their own. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28629", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nThoughtworks\u00bbGocdVersions  before (<) 23.1.0cpe:2.3:a:thoughtworks:gocd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-04-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-04-04  0.04%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/23.1.0", "ref_desc": "Release GoCD 23.1.0 \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DJAMkTqpL7PtF3ntHBZ8Qwf2qSk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#23-1-0", "ref_desc": "Releases - Version notes | GoCDRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/gsP2Xx5gans6NnduW-5aGfD-vG4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/c6aa644973b034305bbe9ea34b010dcf5b5790ce", "ref_desc": "Encode VSM node attributes for HTML \u00b7 gocd/gocd@c6aa644 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/pipeline_labeling.html", "ref_desc": "Pipeline Labelling | GoCD User DocumentationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/95f758229d419411a38577608709d8552cccf193", "ref_desc": "Improve escaping on legacy Freemarker templates \u00b7 gocd/gocd@95f7582 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-3vvg-gjfr-q9vm", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS possible on VSM and Job Details pages via malicious pipeline label configuration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gocd/gocd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
