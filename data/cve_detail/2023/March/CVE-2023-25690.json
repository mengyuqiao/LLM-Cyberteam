{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-25690", "Description": "Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations are affected when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule\n or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches\n some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then\n re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable \nsubstitution. For example, something like:\n\n\n\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule \"^/here/(.*)\" \"http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1\"; [P]\nProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/\n\n\nRequest splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning. Users are recommended to update to at least version 2.4.56 of Apache HTTP Server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25690", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbHttp ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.4.55cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.00% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-26  1.21%  1.00%  -0.21 \n 2  2024-10-12  1.48%  1.21%  -0.27 \n 3  2024-09-27  1.05%  1.48%  +0.43 \n 4  2024-08-17  0.75%  1.05%  +0.30 \n 5  2024-07-21  0.74%  0.75%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-04-08  0.63%  0.74%  +0.11 \n 7  2024-03-26  0.64%  0.63%  -0.01 \n 8  2024-03-13  1.18%  0.64%  -0.54 \n 9  2024-01-10  3.26%  1.18%  -2.08 \n 10  2023-10-01  4.40%  3.26%  -1.15 \n 11  2023-09-09  6.73%  4.40%  -2.33 \n 12  2023-07-10  6.44%  6.73%  +0.30 \n 13  2023-05-22  3.38%  6.44%  +3.06 \n 14  2023-05-20  2.16%  3.38%  +1.22 \n 15  2023-05-08  1.30%  2.16%  +0.86 \n 16  2023-04-16  0.32%  1.30%  +0.97 \n 17  2023-04-09  0.23%  0.32%  +0.10 \n 18  2023-03-15  0.04%  0.23%  +0.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html", "ref_desc": "httpd 2.4 vulnerabilities - The Apache HTTP Server ProjectVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bRHJW4C-Q8TD4xU-vQxvHsw9lnk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-01", "ref_desc": "Apache HTTPD: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202309-01) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Ib4iXZJ_VeuXdT0CACPrMc3R5H4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176334/Apache-2.4.55-mod_proxy-HTTP-Request-Smuggling.html", "ref_desc": "Apache 2.4.55 mod_proxy HTTP Request Smuggling \u2248 Packet Storm", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00028.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3401-1] apache2 security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/V3WbohUK8_JCLLRwOtz0HqnokIU.html"}]}
