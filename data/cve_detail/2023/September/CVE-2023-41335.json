{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41335", "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. When users update their passwords, the new credentials may be briefly held in the server database. While this doesn't grant the server any added capabilities\u2014it already learns the users' passwords as part of the authentication process\u2014it does disrupt the expectation that passwords won't be stored in the database. As a result, these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database backups for a longer duration. These temporarily stored passwords are automatically erased after a 48-hour window. This issue has been addressed in version 1.93.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41335", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  from including (>=) 1.66.0andbefore (<) 1.93.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-19  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-10-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-10-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16272", "ref_desc": "Avoid temporary storage of sensitive information. by clokep \u00b7 Pull Request #16272 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-4f74-84v3-j9q5", "ref_desc": "Temporary storage of plaintext passwords during password changes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2AFB2Y3S2VCPCN5P2XCZTG24MBMZ7DM4/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: matrix-synapse-1.80.0-6.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EDb5I7jyv7OgERcwDmLD1jojebw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-12", "ref_desc": "Synapse: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202401-12) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JE1VEBRtwAveapniePTKkBogBqE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/65QPC55I4D27HIZP7H2NQ34EOXHPP4AO/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: matrix-synapse-1.93.0-2.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pEFmVjL0fWLEReRp7NveADReOuI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N6P4QULVUE254WI7XF2LWWOGHCYVFXFY/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: matrix-synapse-1.94.0-2.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TjRnFi9Q7OZ6U3zQjzkWf7nfxsw.html"}]}
