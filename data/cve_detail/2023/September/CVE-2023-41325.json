{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41325", "Description": "OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology. Starting in version 3.20 and prior to version 3.22, `shdr_verify_signature` can make a double free. `shdr_verify_signature` used to verify a TA binary before it is loaded. To verify a signature of it, allocate a memory for RSA key. RSA key allocate function (`sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key`) will try to allocate a memory (which is optee\u2019s heap memory). RSA key is consist of exponent and modulus (represent as variable `e`, `n`) and it allocation is not atomic way, so it may succeed in `e` but fail in `n`. In this case sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key` will free on `e` and return as it is failed but variable \u2018e\u2019 is remained as already freed memory address . `shdr_verify_signature` will free again that memory (which is `e`) even it is freed when it failed allocate RSA key. A patch is available in version 3.22. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41325", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinaro\u00bbOp-teeVersions  from including (>=) 3.20.0andbefore (<) 3.22.0cpe:2.3:o:linaro:op-tee:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinaro\u00bbOp-tee\u00bbVersion:3.22.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:o:linaro:op-tee:3.22.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-415 Double Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/415/Double-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/commit/e2ec831cb07ed0099535c7c140cb6338aa62816a", "ref_desc": "core: crypto_bignum_free(): add indirection and set pointer to NULL \u00b7 OP-TEE/optee_os@e2ec831 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/security/advisories/GHSA-jrw7-63cq-7vhm", "ref_desc": "Double free in shdr_verify_signature \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OP-TEE/optee_os \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
