{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41333", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. An attacker with the ability to create or modify CiliumNetworkPolicy objects in a particular namespace is able to affect traffic on an entire Cilium cluster, potentially bypassing policy enforcement in other namespaces. By using a crafted `endpointSelector` that uses the `DoesNotExist` operator on the `reserved:init` label, the attacker can create policies that bypass namespace restrictions and affect the entire Cilium cluster. This includes potentially allowing or denying all traffic. This attack requires API server access, as described in the Kubernetes API Server Attacker section of the Cilium Threat Model. This issue has been resolved in Cilium versions 1.14.2, 1.13.7, and 1.12.14. As a workaround an admission webhook can be used to prevent the use of `endpointSelectors` that use the `DoesNotExist` operator on the `reserved:init` label in CiliumNetworkPolicies.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41333", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  before (<) 1.12.14cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.14.2cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.7cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-01  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 \n 2  2023-09-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/28007", "ref_desc": "k8s: Restrict configuring reserved:init policy via CNP by joestringer \u00b7 Pull Request #28007 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/threat-model/#kubernetes-api-server-attacker", "ref_desc": "Threat Model \u2014 Cilium 1.14.2 documentationProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-4xp2-w642-7mcx", "ref_desc": "Bypass of namespace restrictions in CiliumNetworkPolicy \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
