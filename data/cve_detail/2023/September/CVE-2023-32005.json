{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-32005", "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js version 20, affecting users of the experimental permission model when the --allow-fs-read flag is used with a non-* argument.\n\nThis flaw arises from an inadequate permission model that fails to restrict file stats through the `fs.statfs` API. As a result, malicious actors can retrieve stats from files that they do not have explicit read access to.\n\nThis vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20.\n\nPlease note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32005", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNodejs\u00bbNode.js\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 20.0.0andbefore (<) 20.5.1cpe:2.3:a:nodejs:node.js:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-18  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-12  0.08%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-23  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-21  0.04%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/2051224", "ref_desc": "Node.js | Report #2051224 - fs.statfs bypasses Permission Model | HackerOneExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231103-0004/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-32005 Node.js Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
