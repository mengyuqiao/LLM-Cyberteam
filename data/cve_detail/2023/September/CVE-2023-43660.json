{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43660", "Description": "Warpgate is a smart SSH, HTTPS and MySQL bastion host for Linux that doesn't need special client apps. The SSH key verification for a user can be bypassed by sending an SSH key offer without a signature. This allows bypassing authentication under following conditions: 1. The attacker knows the username and a valid target name 2. The attacked knows the user's public key and 3. Only SSH public key authentication is required for the user account. This issue has been addressed in version 0.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43660", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nWarpgate Project\u00bbWarpgateVersions  before (<) 0.8.1cpe:2.3:a:warpgate_project:warpgate:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-29  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-03  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-08-27  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-03  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/security/advisories/GHSA-3cjp-w4cp-m9c8", "ref_desc": "SSH key password bypassed by not entering anything in as the password during ssh auth \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 warp-tech/warpgate \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/commit/a4df7f7a21395cfaee7a9789d1e3846290caeb63", "ref_desc": "fixed GHSA-3cjp-w4cp-m9c8 - interpreting SSH public key offers as a s\u2026 \u00b7 warp-tech/warpgate@a4df7f7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
