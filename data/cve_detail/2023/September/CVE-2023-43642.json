{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43642", "Description": "snappy-java is a Java port of the snappy, a fast C++ compresser/decompresser developed by Google. The SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks when decompressing data with a too large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound check on chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur. All versions of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3 are vulnerable to this issue. A fix has been introduced in commit `9f8c3cf74` which will be included in the 1.1.10.4 release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only accept compressed data from trusted sources.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43642", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nXerial\u00bbSnappy-javaVersions  before (<) 1.1.10.4cpe:2.3:a:xerial:snappy-java:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-27  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-01  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-27  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/9f8c3cf74223ed0a8a834134be9c917b9f10ceb5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-55g7-9cwv-5qfv \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java@9f8c3cf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-55g7-9cwv-5qfv", "ref_desc": "Missing upper bound check on chunk length in snappy-java can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) impact \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xerial/snappy-java \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
