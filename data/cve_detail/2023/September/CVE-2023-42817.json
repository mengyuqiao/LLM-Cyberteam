{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42817", "Description": "Pimcore admin-ui-classic-bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. The translation value with text including \u201c%s\u201d (from \u201c%suggest%) is parsed by sprintf() even though it\u2019s supposed to be output literally to the user. The translations may be accessible by a user with comparatively lower overall access (as the translation permission cannot be scoped to certain \u201cmodules\u201d) and a skilled attacker might be able to exploit the parsing of the translation string in the dialog box. This issue has been patched in commit `abd77392` which is included in release 1.1.2. Users are advised to update to version 1.1.2 or apply the patch manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42817", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPimcore\u00bbAdmin Classic Bundle\u00bbForPimcoreVersions  before (<) 1.1.2cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:admin_classic_bundle:*:*:*:*:*:pimcore:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-25  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-27  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/security/advisories/GHSA-m988-7375-7g2c", "ref_desc": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Translations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/abd7739298f974319e3cac3fd4fcd7f995b63e4c", "ref_desc": "[Bug]: Fix avoid recursion on replaced arguments having further % (#264) \u00b7 pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle@abd7739 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
