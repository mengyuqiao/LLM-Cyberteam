{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-34195", "Description": "An issue was discovered in SystemFirmwareManagementRuntimeDxe in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. The implementation of the GetImage method retrieves the value of a runtime variable named GetImageProgress, and later uses this value as a function pointer. This variable is wiped out by the same module near the end of the function. By setting this UEFI variable from the OS to point into custom code, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution in the DXE phase, before several chipset locks are set.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34195", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nInsyde\u00bbInsydeh2oVersions  from including (>=) 5.5andbefore (<) 5.5.05.53.22cpe:2.3:a:insyde:insydeh2o:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nInsyde\u00bbInsydeh2oVersions  from including (>=) 5.6andbefore (<) 5.6.05.60.22cpe:2.3:a:insyde:insydeh2o:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nInsyde\u00bbInsydeh2oVersions  from including (>=) 5.4andbefore (<) 5.4.05.45.22cpe:2.3:a:insyde:insydeh2o:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nInsyde\u00bbInsydeh2oVersions  from including (>=) 5.2andbefore (<) 5.2.05.28.22cpe:2.3:a:insyde:insydeh2o:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nInsyde\u00bbInsydeh2oVersions  from including (>=) 5.3andbefore (<) 5.3.05.37.22cpe:2.3:a:insyde:insydeh2o:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.insyde.com/security-pledge", "ref_desc": "Insyde's Security Pledge | Insyde SoftwareVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ib69XaDxtR6lbqvbe6j25hD0kuk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.insyde.com/security-pledge/SA-2023052", "ref_desc": "Insyde Security Advisory 2023052 | Insyde SoftwareVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
