{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43632", "Description": "As noted in the \u201cVTPM.md\u201d file in the eve documentation, \u201cVTPM is a server listening on port\n8877 in EVE, exposing limited functionality of the TPM to the clients. \nVTPM allows clients to\nexecute tpm2-tools binaries from a list of hardcoded options\u201d\nThe communication with this server is done using protobuf, and the data is comprised of 2\nparts:\n\n1. Header\n\n2. Data\n\nWhen a connection is made, the server is waiting for 4 bytes of data, which will be the header,\nand these 4 bytes would be parsed as uint32 size of the actual data to come.\n\nThen, in the function \u201chandleRequest\u201d this size is then used in order to allocate a payload on\nthe stack for the incoming data.\n\nAs this payload is allocated on the stack, this will allow overflowing the stack size allocated for\nthe relevant process with freely controlled data.\n\n* An attacker can crash the system. \n* An attacker can gain control over the system, specifically on the \u201cvtpm_server\u201d process\nwhich has very high privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43632", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbEdge Virtualization EngineVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.0cpe:2.3:o:linuxfoundation:edge_virtualization_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-27  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-08-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/789/Memory-Allocation-with-Excessive-Size-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2023-43632/", "ref_desc": "Freely Allocate Buffer on The Stack With Data From Socket - Automotive Security Research Group", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://asrg.io/security-advisories/freely-allocate-buffer-on-the-stack-with-data-from-socket/", "ref_desc": "Freely Allocate Buffer on The Stack With Data From Socket - Automotive Security Research GroupThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
