{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41318", "Description": "matrix-media-repo is a highly customizable multi-domain media repository for the Matrix chat ecosystem. In affected versions an attacker could upload a malicious piece of media to the media repo, which would then be served with `Content-Disposition: inline` upon download. This vulnerability could be leveraged to execute scripts embedded in SVG content. Commits `77ec235` and `bf8abdd` fix the issue and are included in the 1.3.0 release. Operators should upgrade to v1.3.0 as soon as possible. Operators unable to upgrade should override the `Content-Disposition` header returned by matrix-media-repo as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41318", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTurt2live\u00bbMatrix-media-repoVersions  before (<) 1.3.0cpe:2.3:a:turt2live:matrix-media-repo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-14  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script", "ref_desc": "<script> - SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics | MDNThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/commit/77ec2354e8f46d5ef149d1dcaf25f51c04149137", "ref_desc": "Fix Content-Disposition handling \u00b7 turt2live/matrix-media-repo@77ec235 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/security/advisories/GHSA-5crw-6j7v-xc72", "ref_desc": "Unsafe media served inline on download endpoints \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 turt2live/matrix-media-repo \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/commit/bf8abdd7a5371118e280c65a8e0ec2b2e9bdaf59", "ref_desc": "Sniff content type during download for disposition \u00b7 turt2live/matrix-media-repo@bf8abdd \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
