{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40019", "Description": "FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.10, FreeSWITCH allows authorized users to cause a denial of service attack by sending re-INVITE with SDP containing duplicate codec names. When a call in FreeSWITCH completes codec negotiation, the `codec_string` channel variable is set with the result of the negotiation. On a subsequent re-negotiation, if an SDP is offered that contains codecs with the same names but with different formats, there may be too many codec matches detected by FreeSWITCH leading to overflows of its internal arrays. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to corrupt stack of FreeSWITCH leading to an undefined behavior of the system or simply crash it. Version 1.10.10 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40019", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFreeswitch\u00bbFreeswitchVersions  before (<) 1.10.10cpe:2.3:a:freeswitch:freeswitch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-21  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-15  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-22  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/security/advisories/GHSA-gjj5-79p2-9g3q", "ref_desc": "FreeSWITCH allows authorized users to cause a denial of service attack by sending re-INVITE with SDP containing duplicate codec names \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/releases/tag/v1.10.10", "ref_desc": "Release FreeSWITCH v1.10.10 Release \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Z_EsJvbnwngz9WYezLvMCxRwLcc.html"}]}
