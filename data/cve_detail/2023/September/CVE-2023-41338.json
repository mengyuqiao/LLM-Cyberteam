{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41338", "Description": "Fiber is an Express inspired web framework built in the go language. Versions of gofiber prior to 2.49.2 did not properly restrict access to localhost. This issue impacts users of our project who rely on the `ctx.IsFromLocal` method to restrict access to localhost requests. If exploited, it could allow unauthorized access to resources intended only for localhost. Setting `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` in a request from a foreign host, will result in true for `ctx.IsFromLocal`. Access is limited to the scope of the affected process. This issue has been patched in version `2.49.2` with commit `b8c9ede6`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading to the patched version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41338", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass", "Affected Products": "\nGofiber\u00bbFiberVersions  before (<) 2.49.2cpe:2.3:a:gofiber:fiber:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-10  0.08%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-14  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-13  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.gofiber.io/api/ctx#isfromlocal", "ref_desc": "\ud83e\udde0 Ctx | FiberProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For", "ref_desc": "X-Forwarded-For - HTTP | MDNTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-3q5p-3558-364f", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in Ctx.IsFromLocal() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gofiber/fiber \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/commit/b8c9ede6efa231116c4bd8bb9d5e03eac1cb76dc", "ref_desc": "IsFromLocal corrected \u00b7 gofiber/fiber@b8c9ede \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
