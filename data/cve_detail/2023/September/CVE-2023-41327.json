{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41327", "Description": "WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. WireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules, where the allowed list is evaluated first. \n\nUntil WireMock Webhooks Extension 3.0.0-beta-15, the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration, POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock\u2019s instance. For example, If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster, they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token, discovered using another exploit, via authentication headers. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1 and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock studio has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users unable to upgrade should use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41327", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nWiremock\u00bbWiremockVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.35.1cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:wiremock:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWiremock\u00bbWiremockVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.3cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:wiremock:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWiremock\u00bbStudioVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.32.0-17cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:studio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-08  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-09-13  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/security/advisories/GHSA-hq8w-9w8w-pmx7", "ref_desc": "Controlled SSRF through URL in the WireMock Webhooks Extension and WireMock Studio \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wiremock/wiremock \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/releases/tag/3.0.0-beta-15", "ref_desc": "Release 3.0.0-beta-15 \u00b7 wiremock/wiremock \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses", "ref_desc": "Configuring WireMock in Java | WireMockPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PajUeq2qam97np-YzAMUFfRVb3I.html"}]}
