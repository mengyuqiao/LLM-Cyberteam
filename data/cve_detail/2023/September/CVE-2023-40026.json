{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40026", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment framework for Kubernetes. In Argo CD versions prior to 2.3 (starting at least in v0.1.0, but likely in any version using Helm before 2.3), using a specifically-crafted Helm file could reference external Helm charts handled by the same repo-server to leak values, or files from the referenced Helm Chart. This was possible because Helm paths were predictable. The vulnerability worked by adding a Helm chart that referenced Helm resources from predictable paths. Because the paths of Helm charts were predictable and available on an instance of repo-server, it was possible to reference and then render the values and resources from other existing Helm charts regardless of permissions. While generally, secrets are not stored in these files, it was nevertheless possible to reference any values from these charts. This issue was fixed in Argo CD 2.3 and subsequent versions by randomizing Helm paths. User's still using Argo CD 2.3 or below are advised to update to a supported version. If this is not possible, disabling Helm chart rendering, or using an additional repo-server for each Helm chart would prevent possible exploitation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40026", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  before (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-27  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-03  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-6jqw-jwf5-rp8h", "ref_desc": "Path traversal allows leaking out-of-bound Helm charts from Argo CD repo-server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/installation/#supported-versions", "ref_desc": "Installation - Argo CD - Declarative GitOps CD for KubernetesProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
