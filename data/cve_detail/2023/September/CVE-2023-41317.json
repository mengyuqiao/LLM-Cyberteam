{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41317", "Description": "The Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when GraphQL Subscriptions are enabled.  It can be triggered when **all of the following conditions are met**: 1. Running Apollo Router v1.28.0, v1.28.1 or v1.29.0 (\"impacted versions\"); **and** 2. The Supergraph schema provided to the Router (either via Apollo Uplink or explicitly via other configuration)\u00a0**has a `subscription` type** with root-fields defined; **and** 3. The YAML configuration provided to the Router **has subscriptions enabled** (they are _disabled_ by default), either by setting `enabled: true` _or_ by setting a valid `mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [subscriptions' documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#router-setup)); **and** 4. An [anonymous](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Anonymous-Operation-Definitions) (i.e., un-named) `subscription` operation (e.g., `subscription { ... }`) is received by the Router If **all four** of these criteria are met, the impacted versions will panic and terminate.  There is no data-privacy risk or sensitive-information exposure aspect to this vulnerability. This is fixed in Apollo Router v1.29.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Updating to v1.29.1 should be a clear and simple upgrade path for those running impacted versions.  However, if Subscriptions are **not** necessary for your Graph \u2013 but are enabled via configuration \u2014 then disabling subscriptions is another option to mitigate the risk.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41317", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nApollographql\u00bbApollo RouterVersions  from including (>=) 1.28.0andbefore (<) 1.29.1cpe:2.3:a:apollographql:apollo_router:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-07  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-11  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/b295c103dd86c57c848397d32e8094edfa8502aa", "ref_desc": "Subscriptions: Correct v1.28.x regression allowing panic via un-named\u2026 \u00b7 apollographql/router@b295c10 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.29.1", "ref_desc": "Release v1.29.1 \u00b7 apollographql/router \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-w8vq-3hf9-xppx", "ref_desc": "Unnamed \"Subscription\" operation results in Denial-of-Service in v1.28.0, v1.28.1 and v1.29.0 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 apollographql/router \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
