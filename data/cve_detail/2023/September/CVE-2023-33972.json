{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-33972", "Description": "Scylladb is a NoSQL data store using the seastar framework, compatible with Apache Cassandra. Authenticated users who are authorized to create tables in a keyspace can escalate their privileges to access a table in the same keyspace, even if they don't have permissions for that table. This issue has not yet been patched. A workaround to address this issue is to disable CREATE privileges on a keyspace, and create new tables on behalf of other users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33972", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nScylladb\u00bbScylladbVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.2.8cpe:2.3:a:scylladb:scylladb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-03  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-08-27  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-03  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/security/advisories/GHSA-ww5v-p45p-3vhq", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation from having CREATE access on a keyspace to full permission on a table in that keyspace \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 scylladb/scylladb \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
