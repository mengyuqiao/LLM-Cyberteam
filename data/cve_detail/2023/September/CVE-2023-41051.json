{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41051", "Description": "In a typical Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) there are several components, such as boot loader, virtual device drivers, virtio backend drivers and vhost drivers, that need to access the VM physical memory. The vm-memory rust crate provides a set of traits to decouple VM memory consumers from VM memory providers. An issue was discovered in the default implementations of the `VolatileMemory::{get_atomic_ref, aligned_as_ref, aligned_as_mut, get_ref, get_array_ref}` trait functions, which allows out-of-bounds memory access if the `VolatileMemory::get_slice` function returns a `VolatileSlice` whose length is less than the function\u2019s `count` argument. No implementations of `get_slice` provided in `vm_memory` are affected. Users of custom `VolatileMemory` implementations may be impacted if the custom implementation does not adhere to `get_slice`'s documentation. The issue started in version 0.1.0 but was fixed in version 0.12.2 by inserting a check that verifies that the `VolatileSlice` returned by `get_slice` is of the correct length. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41051", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVm-memory Project\u00bbVm-memory\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.1.0andbefore (<) 0.12.2cpe:2.3:a:vm-memory_project:vm-memory:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-03  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://crates.io/crates/vm-memory/0.12.2", "ref_desc": "vm-memory - crates.io: Rust Package RegistryProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/commit/aff1dd4a5259f7deba56692840f7a2d9ca34c9c8", "ref_desc": "fix: Validate return value of get_slice in VolatileMemory \u00b7 rust-vmm/vm-memory@aff1dd4 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SYM6CYW2DWRHRAVL2HYTQPXC3J2V77J4/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: libkrun-1.5.0-6.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IPXRXD5VXBZHBGMUM77B52CJJMG7EJGI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: firecracker-1.4.1-2.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/security/advisories/GHSA-49hh-fprx-m68g", "ref_desc": "Default functions in VolatileMemory trait lack bounds checks, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-vmm/vm-memory \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XZGJL6BQLU4XCPQLLTW4GSSBTNQXB3TI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: virtiofsd-1.7.0-4.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
