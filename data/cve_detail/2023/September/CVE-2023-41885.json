{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41885", "Description": "Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41885", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPiccolo-orm\u00bbPiccoloVersions  before (<) 0.121.0cpe:2.3:a:piccolo-orm:piccolo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-204 Observable Response Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/204/Observable-Response-Discrepancy.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/commit/edcfe3568382922ba3e3b65896e6e7272f972261", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-h7cm-mrvq-wcfr \u00b7 piccolo-orm/piccolo@edcfe35 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/security/advisories/GHSA-h7cm-mrvq-wcfr", "ref_desc": "Current `BaseUser.login` implementation is vulnerable to time based user enumeration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 piccolo-orm/piccolo \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
