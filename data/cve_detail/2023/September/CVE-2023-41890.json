{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41890", "Description": "Sustainsys.Saml2 library adds SAML2P support to ASP.NET web sites, allowing the web site to act as a SAML2 Service Provider. \nPrior to versions 1.0.3 and 2.9.2, when a response is processed, the issuer of the Identity Provider is not sufficiently validated. This could allow a malicious identity provider to craft a Saml2 response that is processed as if issued by another identity provider. It is also possible for a malicious end user to cause stored state intended for one identity provider to be used when processing the response from another provider. An application is impacted if they rely on any of these features in their authentication/authorization logic: the issuer of the generated identity and claims; or items in the stored request state (AuthenticationProperties). This issue is patched in versions 2.9.2 and 1.0.3. The `AcsCommandResultCreated` notification can be used to add the validation required if an upgrade to patched packages is not possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41890", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSustainsys\u00bbSaml2Versions  before (<) 1.0.3cpe:2.3:a:sustainsys:saml2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSustainsys\u00bbSaml2Versions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.9.2cpe:2.3:a:sustainsys:saml2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-289 Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/289/Authentication-Bypass-by-Alternate-Name.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2/issues/712", "ref_desc": "Reserved Issue# \u00b7 Issue #712 \u00b7 Sustainsys/Saml2 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;PatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Bypyl7wnuNV-3G4xgKuTGHpisNo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2/issues/713", "ref_desc": "Bind stored request state to module path \u00b7 Issue #713 \u00b7 Sustainsys/Saml2 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2/security/advisories/GHSA-fv2h-753j-9g39", "ref_desc": "Insufficient Identity Provider Issuer Validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Sustainsys/Saml2 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
