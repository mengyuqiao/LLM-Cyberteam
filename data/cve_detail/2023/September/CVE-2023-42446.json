{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42446", "Description": "Pow is a authentication and user management solution for Phoenix and Plug-based apps. Starting in version 1.0.14 and prior to version 1.0.34, use of `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` is susceptible to session hijacking as expired keys are not being invalidated correctly on startup. A session may expire when all `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` instances have been shut down for a period that is longer than a session's remaining TTL. Version 1.0.34 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, expired keys, including all expired sessions, can be manually invalidated.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42446", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPowauth\u00bbPOWVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.14andbefore (<) 1.0.34cpe:2.3:a:powauth:pow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-23  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-298 Improper Validation of Certificate Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/298/Improper-Validation-of-Certificate-Expiration.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-672 Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/672/Operation-on-a-Resource-after-Expiration-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/issues/713", "ref_desc": "Persistence of stale session ids in MnesiaCache \u00b7 Issue #713 \u00b7 pow-auth/pow \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/security/advisories/GHSA-3cjh-p6pw-jhv9", "ref_desc": "Pow Mnesia cache doesn't invalidate all expired keys on startup \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pow-auth/pow \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
