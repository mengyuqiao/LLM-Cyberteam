{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41050", "Description": "AccessControl provides a general security framework for use in Zope. Python's \"format\" functionality allows someone controlling the format string to \"read\" objects accessible (recursively) via attribute access and subscription from accessible objects. Those attribute accesses and subscriptions use Python's full blown `getattr` and `getitem`, not the policy restricted `AccessControl` variants `_getattr_` and `_getitem_`. This can lead to critical information disclosure. `AccessControl` already provides a safe variant for `str.format` and denies access to `string.Formatter`. However, `str.format_map` is still unsafe. Affected are all users who allow untrusted users to create `AccessControl` controlled Python code and execute it. A fix has been introduced in versions 4.4, 5.8 and 6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41050", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.8.4cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  before (<) 4.8.9cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbAccesscontrolVersions  from including (>=) 5.0andbefore (<) 5.8cpe:2.3:a:zope:accesscontrol:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbAccesscontrolVersions  before (<) 4.4cpe:2.3:a:zope:accesscontrol:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbAccesscontrolVersions  from including (>=) 6.0andbefore (<) 6.2cpe:2.3:a:zope:accesscontrol:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-12  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-09-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/commit/6bc32692e0d4b8d5cf64eae3d19de987c7375bc9", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-8xv7-89vj-q48c \u00b7 zopefoundation/AccessControl@6bc3269 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-8xv7-89vj-q48c", "ref_desc": "Information disclosure through Python's \"format\" functionality \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/AccessControl \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
