{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41889", "Description": "SHIRASAGI is a Content Management System. Prior to version 1.18.0, SHIRASAGI is vulnerable to a Post-Unicode normalization issue. This happens when a logical validation or a security check is performed before a Unicode normalization. The Unicode character equivalent of a character would resurface after the normalization. The fix is initially performing the Unicode normalization and then strip for all whitespaces and then checking for a blank string. This issue has been fixed in version 1.18.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41889", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSs-proj\u00bbShirasagiVersions  before (<) 1.18.0cpe:2.3:a:ss-proj:shirasagi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-21  0.10%  0.17%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-08-15  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-21  0.05%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-116 Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/116/Improper-Encoding-or-Escaping-of-Output.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-176 Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/176/Improper-Handling-of-Unicode-Encoding.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shirasagi/shirasagi/blob/f249ce3f06f6bfbc0017b38f5c13de424334c3ea/app/models/concerns/rdf/object.rb#L68-L72", "ref_desc": "shirasagi/app/models/concerns/rdf/object.rb at f249ce3f06f6bfbc0017b38f5c13de424334c3ea \u00b7 shirasagi/shirasagi \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sim4n6.beehiiv.com/p/unicode-characters-bypass-security-checks", "ref_desc": "Unicode characters to Bypass Security ChecksExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shirasagi/shirasagi/security/advisories/GHSA-xr45-c2jv-2v9r", "ref_desc": "Late-Unicode normalization vulnerability in shirasagi/shirasagi \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shirasagi/shirasagi \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
