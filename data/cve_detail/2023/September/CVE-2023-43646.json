{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43646", "Description": "get-func-name is a module to retrieve a function's name securely and consistently both in NodeJS and the browser. Versions prior to 2.0.1 are subject to a regular expression denial of service (redos) vulnerability which may lead to a denial of service when parsing malicious input. This vulnerability can be exploited when there is an imbalance in parentheses, which results in excessive backtracking and subsequently increases the CPU load and processing time significantly. This vulnerability can be triggered using the following input: '\\t'.repeat(54773) + '\\t/function/i'. This issue has been addressed in commit `f934b228b` which has been included in releases from 2.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43646", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nChaijs\u00bbGet-func-name\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.0.1cpe:2.3:a:chaijs:get-func-name:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-02  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-03  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/chaijs/get-func-name/security/advisories/GHSA-4q6p-r6v2-jvc5", "ref_desc": "redos in get-func-name \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 chaijs/get-func-name \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/chaijs/get-func-name/commit/f934b228b5e2cb94d6c8576d3aac05493f667c69", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-4q6p-r6v2-jvc5 \u00b7 chaijs/get-func-name@f934b22 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
