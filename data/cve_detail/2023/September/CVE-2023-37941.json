{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37941", "Description": "If an attacker gains write access to the Apache Superset metadata database, they could persist a specifically crafted Python object that may lead to remote code execution on Superset's web backend.\n\nThe Superset metadata db is an 'internal' component that is typically \nonly accessible directly by the system administrator and the superset \nprocess itself. Gaining access to that database should\n be difficult and require significant privileges.\n\nThis vulnerability impacts Apache Superset versions 1.5.0 up to and including 2.1.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37941", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSupersetVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:superset:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.44% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-08  0.31%  0.44%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-09-12  0.23%  0.31%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-03-13  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-15  0.08%  0.22%  +0.14 \n 5  2023-10-01  0.25%  0.08%  -0.17 \n 6  2023-09-13  0.05%  0.25%  +0.20 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175094/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Superset 2.0.0 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1svmD3_HCW5NerBU5PQsOHD_rEk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/6qk1zscc06yogxxfgz2bh2bvz6vh9g7h", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-37941: Apache Superset: Metadata db write access can lead to remote code execution-Apache Mail ArchivesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
