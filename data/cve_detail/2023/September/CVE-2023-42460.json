{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42460", "Description": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. The `_abi_decode()` function does not validate input when it is nested in an expression. Uses of `_abi_decode()` can be constructed which allow for bounds checking to be bypassed resulting in incorrect results. This issue has not yet been fixed, but a fix is expected in release `0.3.10`.
